I know on 12/2018 , said that was my last post.
I just have to chime in on thi s virus fear everyone has and the insane hoarding going on.
Let me tell you what I learned about the word fear and what it means: F = FACE E = EVERYTHING A = AND R = RECOVER That is why this disease of AD and FTD do not scare me or am I afraid of what is happening to me, for i know this will all end.
So will the CV end for all of the World, so  FACE it and you will be fine, whether you catch it or not.
Life goes on and do not be afraid of  others.
God Bless You & Keep You all over the World.

HELLO, may seem like an unlikely title for my last post but I think not.
It is a friendly word of welcome to all those who have visited my site and left comments.
To say good bye or farewell just seems to me to be so unkind and non caring.
Besides it is also a word that suggests that the one you are greeting is welcomed in friendship.
It has been a long 12+ years that i have done this blog and it is just to exhausting now.
It has taken me several weeks to get to this post.
The stress of our move to Nevada, all the updating to the house and MR.
AD and friend FTD have just become to much for my 1/2 brain cell, which I think (that is a joke) has gone into hiding.
My ability to follow conversations has become close to non existence and I am having more and more periods of disappearing while I am still here.
I have outlasted the so called time allowance for these two diseases, whether that is good or bad i do not know.
I have met many new people hopefully helped a few understand these diseases from Our Side fo the Fence.
I have tried to keep my humor through it all, but that has become difficult also, no more fun seen in it.
My memories are leaving both recent and past, days are all mixed up.
I have a new week that I designed it is simple called Today.
It is non specific, because that is how I have become.
My body hurts just about everywhere, I do not see well or hear well, my wife says tat is normal for me.
If it was not for her these last 14 years would have been a mess, not to mention the 40 we have been together.
Five kids, eight grandchildren later and #9 do any day, it has been a trip.
Last post I told you about a conferrence I was invited to in Italy next year, well I was invited to Paris next year for a conference.
My blog has received over 30 different awards, of which I am just in awe of, the most rewarding invite, offer what ever you want to call it just came to be Guest Speaker, yup you read it at a conferrence in Ho Chien Meng, China next year.
I say that because The Best Neurological Hospital of China, that is thier name, was the first foreign vistor I had and asked me if the could use my blog for teaching.
I was humbled and honored at that request and this latest has blown my toes off, forget the shoes and socks.
Of course since I do not travel and have always been extremely unsettled to have my feet in the air (afraid!!!!!!)
I do not fly.
I may be a bird brain but I have no feathers.
But what away to leave this blog with those offers.
It has been home for me for a very long time but time has caught up with me and is taking hold faster each day so I must move on to where ever it is I am going.
You see the Joe that started this blog is no longer here, he has slowly left and the fire in him that was there is just ambers.
But just one last time I say to the so called medical field get your Fucking Heads Out of Your Ass and you just might figure this out, asking to much aren't I?
Well stay well, take care of yourselves and from me and my family to you ad yours have a VERY, VERY MERRRY CHRISTMAS AND THE BEST OF NEW YEARS!
God Bless and Keep You and This Country of Ours!

To Mr. B. and Mr. S. and all of your socialist friends and gun grabbers that want to ruin our Country, may you all look back over your shoulders and suffer the same fate as Lot's Wife.

<doc date=Thursday, August 23, 2018>
Well finally I have gotten to the post page.
Me and my friend Alzheimer's have been going to talk to you for months now, but I get here and well things just go south.
Since we moved to Nevada last year I have had a very hard time adjusting to things.
I did not think when we made the move that it would affect me like it has.
I am finally content where we are.
It has taken a lot of brain power, I use that term loosely, to cope with things.
I put so much time and effort into getting the move ready and all paperwork in place and finances that by the time we moved I was totally not with me.
Then all the improvements we have made and a wedding of my youngest all combined to just fry that 1/2 a brain cell that I have left.
The truth be known I really have not been sure of where I have been mentally this last year.
Many times I have forgotten that we moved and things, all of which I have kept to myself.
I have tried to remain calm and pleasant and all that BS, but it has not worked out to well.
Even though I have not personally posted for some time my blog has still won some additional awards, but they do not mean what they used to.
See this is not about awards, it is about my disease and how it affects me, which I am not really sure how to answer any longer.
I have gone back to consulling to helpm ==m , the jury is still out on that.
I have closed my facebook page, left groups I belonged to, have done much of the same with google+ and others.
Not able to keep up with the remains, read posts, comment and the rest they have all become to much to handle.
The heat here is not my friend, but we have central air and I am fine with that.
We have been in the 100's since about mid June, it is finally cooling down at night that means that fall is on it's way here and we will be down in the 80's and 70's.
We live in the desert area, so this is the type of weather we have.
We did go back to southern California on a small trip two or so weeks ago and the humidity there was just to much.
I have gotten use to the dry air here and  the difference in altitude from about 77 ft above sea level to over 2600 ft above.
I am having more trouble keeping my words correct they get more messed up now when I talk than they used to.
It is quite frustrating so many times I just sit and say nothing.
My way of dealing with it.
I get asked you ok and always yes I am fine, whether I am or not.
It is getting harder to hine what is taking place inside this brain of mine.
One thing that really took me back was getting invited to an International meeting with researchers, workers in the field of dementia and Alzheimer's in Europe next year.
Boy what a mistake they made they must not really read my blog to see my feelings about the medical profession, but still an honor for someone like me.
I am fading fast so I am going to go for now.
Not sure when I will be back.
I miss comming here but I just freeze up and go blank on what I want to say.
Not even sure I said what I wanted to here.
Be careful of the Snake Oil peddelers on the Internet, there are no cures and the causes they come up with really are trully fantasies.
No causes 100% confirmed, amazing over 100 years later and they really do not know much more if anything.
Well you take care of yourselves.
God Bless and Keep You and This Country of Ours!

6 Do's and Don'ts of Self-Care for New Caregivers Being a new caregiver can come with a unique set of stresses as you shift much of your life to focus on someone else.
Research has shown that stress can impact both your physical health and mental health.
Here are some important self-care reminders that keep you healthy and happy, as well as help maximize your caregiving abilities.
Do Find a Communication Outlet Many new caregivers are faced with a set of experiences and challenges that are difficult to anticipate, and finding someone who is willing to listen or help is often a powerful source of comfort.
Express yourself and talk about your feelings or experiences.
It can help you identify solutions to difficulties you may run into and cope with your new responsibilities.
A 2016 report from the Health and Wellness Division of the National Academy of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine reports that counseling and self-care can contribute to the overall health of the caregiver as well as the person being cared for.
Some people find that talking to a counselor is most beneficial, while other find that simply having a friend to talk to is sufficient.
Don't Shut Yourself Off from Friends The New York Times highlighted one of the most prominent problems some caregivers might encounter: social isolation.
Isolation can become acute as you focus constantly on the person or people under your care.
Meaningful, healthy relationships help you recharge and continue being an effective caregiver.
Focus on maintaining current social ties that you have, such as a book group, a church group, friends you exercise with, or any other wholesome source.
Do Make Something Tasty The deadlines that come with being a new caregiver can make you feel like it's almost impossible to eat well.
As you settle into your new caregiving responsibilities, it can be hard to find time to make food every day or to eat well all the time.
A little meal prep can go a long way.
Even if you just plan a couple of meals each week, preparing them when you have a little down time minimizes the time required later in the week.
Additionally, being able to treat yourself to a healthy dish that you really enjoy can be an excellent way to shed some stress and just unwind.
Do Build Mental Resilience As a new caregiver, you might experience difficulty with personal care issues like feeding or dressing, and it's important to think through these experiences in advance to come up with ways to make it easier.
There are lots of great resources, such as help groups both online and as meetups, where people are going through similar things to you and can help you find ways to deal with challenges that arise.
Take a look at what you're doing right, too.
It helps you identify progress you're making and can contribute to resilience.
Don't Self-Medicate When you're stressed out, it might be tempting to reach for the bottle or take medication that helps numb the pain.
However, these can be highly addictive.
A recent study showed that caregivers who take care of patients with heavy burdens are likelier than the control group of caregivers to consume antidepressants.
Caregivers who care for dementia patients need to especially utilize self-care, which includes avoiding excessive alcohol and drug use.
Do Something That Makes You Laugh Whether you watch a favorite episode from a sitcom you love or you snuggle in for a night reading a funny book, laughing lightens the responsibilities of caregiving.
A recent HuffPost article highlighted how important it is to take your caregiver role seriously while also not beating yourself up or taking things personally.
Being able to decompress at the end of the day by laughing can help you avoid burnout.
It's easy to lose yourself as you settle into your caregiver role.
Take steps to make sure that you care for yourself; it'll make you a far more effective and capable caregiver.
Author Harry Cline is creator of NewCaregiver.org and author of the upcoming book, The A-Z Home Care Handbook: Health Management How-Tos for Senior Caregivers.
As a retired nursing home administrator, father of three, and caregiver to his ninety-year-old uncle, Harry knows how challenging and rewarding caregiving can be.
He also understands that caregiving is often overwhelming for those just starting out.
He created his website and is writing his new book to offer new caregivers everywhere help and support.
God Bless & Keep You & This Country of Ours!
PS> as you know I am not a caregiver but suffer from Alzheimer's and Dementia.
Harry approached me and asked if he could write an article for my blog, well there it is.

I was reading a post from a lady in the group Alzheimer's and Dementia that I have the honor of being part of.
Her hubby just passed the other day, she used a word i believe in when we with the disease of Alzheimer's, dementia, parkinson's etc.
he was FREED.
That is my belief.
You see we with these diseases are not in a battle, like it is said of those who die from their battle with cancer, oh no we are in a WAR, those that suffer know what I mean.
Alzheimer's lost the WAR it took his mortal body, but HE was FREED and won the right to be whoever he was and even more.
He now joins the universal choir to sing and praise and hear the voice of the armies that have gone before him.
Yes I envy him, I long to leave this hell I live in.
Constantly being asked how are you, are you ok, how do you feel, I understand how it is for you, the Hell you do I say.
Of course I am not ok, my hands can no longer paint, use power tools, build things, I have trouble talking right, I walk like a one legged antelope.
No I am not ok, this disease sucks big time.
To my friend I say, throw open your windows, clean the windows, clean the curtains and drapes, wash the bed sheets and floors.
Let the fresh air sweep away the stench you have lived with.
Take a shower and was the dust of the war from your body, let the burden you have carried float down the drain, for you also have been FREED from you task.
It is now your time to live again as your hubby would tell you in his new found freedom.
Move on, do not morn, rejoice in the time you had with him that is what matters now.
Live, Live, Live and be happy.
Your burden is gone and Your HUBBY is VERY, VERY happy now in his new freedom.
The Voice of the universe will be his guide and friend from now on.
God Bless & Keep You & This Country of Ours!

It has been awhile, but have not been quite up to par.
Guess all this moving, making improvements and the Holidays have taken their toll this year.
To top it off, my computer moved and took everything with it.
Emails, contacts, programs and my life.
Oh well shit happens and seems to do so more these days.
I am still breathing, I think.
Going back into counseling to see if we can somewhat put this 1/2 brain cell I have in some order, lots of luck.
We have cat number 3, his name is Raptor.
He is an F1 male Savanah and has special needs, his rear legs are folded.
What a terror.
He was about 3weeks when we got him, not 3 months, went from 1 pound 2 oz to over 5 pounds now.
The other two love playing with him and him with them.
They run all over chasing each other.
As for me I am very tired and not too much with it these days.
With loosing my emails and contacts well hard to respond to people.
If any of you wish to help me with my contacts send me an email: jolynn1@cox.net.
Till next time take care.

In the last week or so we loss to of Music's greats, who you may not know or remember.
Malcolm Young founder of AC/DC along with his brother formed the group.
Malcolm passed at the age of 64 after a battle with dementia for several years.
Remember the age 64.
David Cassidy, stepson to Shirley Jones and father Jack Cassidy, died this last week at the age of 67 due to complete organ failure, caused by the dementia he had suffered for years.
Both are now free from this disease and world and I for one am happy for them, struggles are over.
I highlighted their ages so that those "experts" who claim Alzheimer's and dementia and the likes as diseases of old age, might get their collected heads out of their asses.
For years on this blog I have fought this draconian idea of only old humans get these diseases.
They whoever they are, claim that 60 is the new 40.
Well I guess dementia starts at forty.
I still stumble and bumble in my fight with Alzheimer's and Frontal temporal Dementia.
This is not a fun world nor is it filled with joy.
For reasons not known to me, I have passed the life expectency for both diseases by 3+ years.
We lost Glenn Campbell approximately 3 years after his Alzheimer's was made public.
Where I am going with this is beyond my brain cell that I have left.
But I would bet David died from Alzheimer's, it shuts down all the organs a trade mark of the disease if you will.
Take care of your selves.

Financial scammers are known to target the senior citizen community, but senior citizens with Alzheimer's are especially at risk.
This is because of the assumption on the part of the scammer that the Alzheimer's patient will be easier to deceive with their scam tactics.
Unfortunately, we constantly hear sad stories about caregivers who realize their loved one has been fleeced financially under these circumstances.
But how do we protect ourselves and our loved ones from financial scams?
Read below to find out!
Alzheimer's disease is an unfortunate condition that is associated with significant memory loss, as many of my readers already know.
This creates a two-fold risk for scam victims, because not only are they more likely to believe the scammer, but they're also more likely to be tricked by the same scammer on numerous occasions.
A person whose memory functions properly will remember when they were scammed in the past and avoid that scammer, but an Alzheimer's patient might forget and fall victim to the very same scam.
The first method of action to avoid being scammed if you're dealing with Alzheimer's is to sign up for an identity theft protection service that runs in the background.
This type of service can be helpful for anyone, but it is especially useful for Alzheimer's patients and their caregivers, because the patient is less likely to remember to check their credit history and stay on top of whether they have recently been scammed.
A service like LifeLock runs in the background and sends mobile alerts to either the patient or the caregiver (whoever signs up for the service) which really makes the process a lot easier.
You should also be sure to meet with an Alzheimer's financial planner, so that you can delegate control of your finances to a trusted party.
If your finances are out of your control, it will prevent you from being scammed even if you fell for the scam.
Last but not least, be sure to read through the accompany infographic (and maybe even print it and tape it on your fridge) so you're aware of the common pattern that financial scams in the senior community take.
If nothing else, knowing what to look for can help you or your loved one stay safe                                                                              God Bless & Keep You & This Country of Ours!

A reader by the name of Katherine asked the following question: Do Alzheimer's Patients really needs Assisted Living?
Katherine, YES  some really do need to be in Assisted Living Facilities.
Reason, because they need special medical needs, they are not able to navagate the home, the home caregivers are not emotionally, physically or finiancially able to handle the sufferer.
Not all need these facilities but many do and a caregiver  generally family should not feel guilty for having them admitted to such a facility.
Your purpose as a caregiver or loved one of the Alzheimer's patient is to give or get them the best care possible, PERIOD.

On September 6, 2006 I started this blog.
It was really just for me to tell how I was coping with Alzheimer's, I never expected even one person to read this blog.
Well 11 years later it is read World Wide, I am a published author, ex-coproducer of short films, have been in a documentary by HBO and won several awards, over 3/4 million page views over 128,000 visitors, am I bosting, YES, never thought this would happen and on this day, I received the following email: Living With Alzheimer's has been selected five years in a row for the 2017 Best of Oceanside Awards for Alzheimer's Education/Referral/Support and now qualifies for the Oceanside Business Hall of Fame.

Now I stand up and forget where the hell I am and look for somewhere to hide and generally fall asleep and wake to figure it out couple hours later.
It is really difficult for me to keep things straightmy brain is sideways now.
I keep reading other posts and many from people who think they know how to handle us and folks they do not have the first fricken idea of that they speak.
By the way I read that certain shampoos now cause Alzheimer's, dementia, etc.
So I guess, do not wash your hair except with bar soap, until they discoover that causes Dementia.
I try to bring you the facts, not the truth which is subjective and changes as our brains change, but facts are facts they do not change and they are what is not what we want things to be.
No Cure for Alzheimer's, no affective treatment, no truly known cause, all guesses and bull shit, FACT everyone that has gotton, will get or has Alszheimer's will DIE from it, PERIOD.

Five Important Facts Veterans Need to Know about Dementia When we think of veterans, we think of selfless, honorable, brave souls, the epitome of an American hero.
These individuals sacrifice their lives to honorably serve our country.
Unfortunately, some of these souls bear the burden of traumatic experiences.
Upon completion of their term, some veterans are left with permanent mental distress.
Research shows that veterans diagnosed with PTSD are twice as likely to be affected with dementia.
Dementia should not be taken lightly as it a disorder of cognitive damages; symptoms may include memory problems and reasoning impairments.
Activities of daily living--eating, dressing, toileting, walking, and bathing-- becomes a struggle for a large portion of the senior population with dementia.
As a result, it is important for veterans to be educated on the topic.
Early awareness of this condition can decrease dementia progression through the application of treatments and preventative measures.
Here are five important facts veterans need to know about dementia 1.
Veteran Dementia Statistics Shockingly, dementia is on the rise.
It is unavoidable as the senior population is growing.
This is evident as an estimated 423,000 new dementia and Alzheimer's cases will appear within the veteran population by the end of 2020.
Veterans with PTSD or Traumatic Brain Injury have a higher probability of getting dementia.
According to a study, veterans with PTSD had a "7-year cumulative incident dementia rate of 10.6% whereas those without had a rate of 6.6%."  2.
Association between Traumatic Brain Injury and Dementia Out of the predicted 423,000 new dementia and Alzheimer's cases, one-fourth of the cases will be correlated with specific military conditions including PTSD and Traumatic Brain Injury.
With high statistics such as this, veterans should seek checkups for optimal mental health.
Head traumas are often common with veterans in combat because they face a higher risk of being struck by objects or explosions.
Some of the symptoms for Traumatic Brain Injury includes behavioral changes, headaches, and memory problems.
Scientists believe that head trauma goes hand in hand with dementia because it contributes to the buildup of beta-amyloid plaques.
Buildup of beta-amyloid plaques exists in Alzheimer's patients.
3.
Resources are Available-VA Benefits Veterans are proven to be a higher risk population for dementia.
Due to their vulnerability, it is of utmost importance for the veterans and their families to be educated on their resources, including the VA program known as Aid and Attendance.
69% of eligible veterans are not utilizing this program because they were not aware of its existence.
This benefit is applicable to assisted living facilities and nursing homes.
According to Veteranaid.org, "A veteran is eligible for up to $1,794 per month, while a surviving spouse is eligible for up to $1,153 per month.
A veteran with a spouse is eligible for up to $2,127 per month and a veteran with a sick spouse is eligible for up to $1,410 per month." Such benefits can decrease the burden on veterans and their love ones.
Websites, such as Senioradvisor.com, provides an idea of assisted living costs.
The median cost is $3,600 per month for a one-bedroom unit and it can rise up to a staggering cost of $7,604 per month for a private, 24-hour private room.
4.
Health Conscious Decisions will Benefit your Brain Health Committing to a healthy lifestyle has credible benefits in dementia prevention.
Some of the health-conscious decisions veterans can make includes a healthy diet and regular exercise.
What you are putting into your body contributes to your mental health.
Foods such as lefty greens are high in folate, which improves cognitive function.
Fruits and vegetables containing anthocyanin--like blackberries, cherries, eggplant, red onions, and so forth--provides the brain extra protection from free radicals.
Free radicals are the toxic byproducts of the human body when undergoing oxygen metabolism.
Not only does food contribute to dementia prevention, seasoning and spices offer the brain some health benefits.
Spices like turmeric, sage, cumin lessens the inflammation of the brain cells.
Problems arise with inflammation when the brain is done using the defense mechanism function.
Afterwards, inflammation just depletes the energy in the brain cells which lessens the firing of the neurons.
Regular exercise increases the blood flow to the brain.
Blood, full of nutrients and oxygen, improves mental health as the brain is feeding on such nourishment that potentially helps in the growth of the brain cells.
5.
Preventative Measures-Taking Supplements  Consumption of omega-3 and vitamin B12 & folic acid supplements can be taken as a preventative measure for dementia.
Omega-3 fatty acid improves the communication of the brain cells, such cell communication is important for cognitive function.
Omega-3 fatty acids are located in the cell membrane, which surrounds the cell bodies.
Furthermore, studies have shown that people who suffer from dementia are deficient in vitamin B12 and folic acid.
Typically, the senior population has a harder time absorbing the vitamin, so consuming it in pill form will suffice.

It has been awhile since I last visited here.
It has been a really rough 2+ months.
The move from California to Nevada has been a real pain.
Toooo much required of this brain of mine.
I am just starting to relax done and feel some of the pressure going away.
My routine is still messed up and causing me problems.
One good thing I have lost almost 20 pounds, I need it.
My temper and ability to cope are getting worst than normal.
It is pobably the stress of the move and all the bull shit that went with it that have me out of line.
I would like to blame it all on the Alzheimer's but I do not think that would be totally honest.
I keep getting emails from people and for some reason they think this is a caregivers' site, well folks far from it.
I have ALZHEIMER'S, yes I do list caregive info, but I am not one at least in the sense you think.
I try to help those caring for us understand what are world is like.
What really gets the hair on my neck to stand is reading all the posts on the net by people who think they really know how to deal with us.
People you are as I would say balf fass fackword (figure it out).
You keep repeating the same lame crap.
Get out of the boxes you are in and really learn how to handle us and that is do not try to handle us, we are not trained dogs.
In case you have not noticed we are truly lost and screwed up people.
KEY WORD HERE IS PEOPLE1  qUIT POSTING THE SAME BS OVER AND OVER, find something original, you are supposed to have the brains and the Paper Hanging Degrees, but apparently neither serve you well.
I wonder how many of you have ever really sat down and truly LISTENED to those you care for or if you just march tho the beat of the EXPERTS, which there are none, except those of us that live in this world of Alzheimer's and other forms of Dementia.
Try and keep us safe, but do not try and be our keepers.
We feel, we hurt, we laugh, we cry, we reach out, we withdraw, yes all the same things you do, but we are akward about it much of the time and very impatient.
I wonder if you would survive a trip through the corridors of my brain for just two hours.
It would be interesting to see how you came out and if your thoughts were different.
Till we meet again.
God Bless & Keep YOu & This Country of Ours!

Well what do Alzheimer's and toes have in common?
They are both part of my existence.
See my daughter told my wife, I am not sure when, as they went to the gym one day it looks like dad has another toe in the water.
Her way of dealing with my dementia and it's progression.
Now I know why my toes hurt all the time, they are not sure what they are supposed to be doing, YEAH!
I must say that the last 6 or so weeks have been very difficult for me.
My head has hurt, my brain has gone off track and I have been outright scared.
See there was I time that this person loved change, he lived for it, he made it happen.
Now no way leave things be.
Do not move a piece of  furniture or painting, it does not play well in my world.
We are moving out of state.
We are in the process of closing on a home in Nevada and this is a major change and has tooooo many arms to it.
Getting everything in line has been a monumental task for me, since the wife works, I have been doing as much of the leg work as I can.
It has literally drain that 1/2 of a brain cell that I have left.
My brain is presently on life support which good old friend Alzheimer's takes great delight in.
It takes every ounce of consentration that I can get together to work on things and leaves me totally exhausted and really lousey to be around, especially as any type of company.
I need a robot to handle all of this so I can get back to some assemblance of order or thought process in my life.
This physically has drained me as well, I am no longer wired to do this type of work and keep it all straight and not be irritable over things.
Unfortunately or fortunately the only way for me to get away is to leave life.
From all of this I have seen in myself a decline and I guess it was going to take place no matter what, after all that is what Alzheimer's does to you.
It sometimes quickly takes you and then other times it is like a cat playing with the mouse it has caught, takes its' time and slowly breaks you down.
I hear that antibiotics of a certain type now cures Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia, as well as drink this and be cured.
Snake oil peddlers are still out there spreading their bullshit and the sad part is that people soak it up and drown in it.
Enough of me, I hurt need drugs, happy drugs or jelly filled donuts.
God Bless and Keep You and This Country of  Ours!

Well here I am again finally, have been going to make this post for a couple of months.
I start and the old brain just stops.
Thinks are getting not to be much fun anymore, but that is to be expected.
This is a series of emails I have received in recent months.
I am posting them this way, because it is to much for me to post each of them under resources.
Test the links at your own risk and bookmark those that are of interest to you and most helpfull.
______________________________________________________________________________________ Hi, My favorite aunt was recently diagnosed with Alzheimer's Disease, and it's sent my family into a whirlwind.
I think part of what's been so tough is that with the abundance of information on the internet, it's tricky to separate the credible resources from the speculative, and the productive from the grim.
Luckily, research is my specialty!
I've been gathering some wonderful resources that will help my family stay educated as the condition progresses without keeping them up at night with worry.
I think they will also be helpful to many in your audience, especially if you add them here: http://living-with-alzhiemers.blogspot.com/2013/01/hello.html.Parent's Guide: Helping Children & Teens Understand Alzheimer'sPreparing Your Home for a Loved One with Alzheimer's: A Caregiver's GuideAnother World: People With Alzheimer's Share Their PerspectivesAlzheimer's Aggression: Causes & ManagementGuide to Addiction Prevention for SeniorsDementia Assistance DogsCaring for the Alzheimer's CaregiverHelping Alzheimer's Sufferers Cope with the Loss of a Loved One: A Guide for Caregivers Learning to cope with and manage Alzheimer's requires the facts, but not the fear!

Lately I've been devoting my focus to senior health -- especially since only 28-34% of Americans aged 65-74 are physically active.
I've had the opportunity to speak with some of the elders in my community, and they said although they do want more physical activity, they feel limited in their options.
Fortunately, inspiring others to get on their feet is my specialty!
I've gathered some terrific resources on ways for seniors to lead happier, more active lives, but I need your help distributing them.

I put a comment on a Facebook post and once my 1/2 brain cell traffic jam cleared up it started to see what I said and what has happened to me since Alzheimer's and I have become such close friends.
After being diagnosed I started this blog over 10 years ago.
My wife keeps reminding me why from time to time because I forgot.
See I started it for me and me alone.
As a kind of journal I guess of what was happening to me.
I never expect to have anything come of it or anyone to read it.
Now this will sound like an ego trip and it may well be for the moment.
In this time more than 124,000 people have visited my blog, it is read in over 90 countries, I have 48,000+ steady readers, it is used in over 165 care facilities in the US and other countries.
I have a book published, Living With Alzhiemer's (A Conversation If You Will), featured in a documentary by HBO called "The Alzheimer's Project" (I am the only left from it that I can find, that is about 13 other gone since 2008 till 2013), several National Webinars, Alzheimer's Speaks Radio with Lori Bay, blog has won a ton of awards, have been called a hero, strong person, and SOB, hard ass, wonderful, etc.
Who would have ever thought a person like me would garner such attention, certianly not this person.
I sit in awe everyday of it.
These are some of the gifts I have been given because of this disease, Alzheimer's, Frontoltemporal Dementia and just no brain cells left.
I challenge all the studies and claims and you know it seems they all fall apart at the challenge.
There is no cure, no treatments (that really work), and the hope seems at least to me very small that the medical field will ever get their collective heads out of their asses and figure this out.
Crap they have had well over 100+ years.
But what the hell, we are still referred to as "THOSE PEOPLE".
See I do my very best to tell it how it is, not how I would like it to be or how you want to hear it.
It has taken my freedom from me, I cannot go anywhere without being taken.
Go on a walk alone no way I may not return.
Once I took my granddaughter to the park by the house, she was about 5 I think.
I was lost, she took me by the hand and said it is ok grandpa I know the way home and so she did.
Each day it takes another slice of me, this fricken damndable disease.
I have even look straight at my wife while talking and asked her who the hell she was, because I forgot.
I can be sitting watching TV or talking and I am gone, not asleep although that happens, just gone my body is there and Joe has disappeared.
I no longer can use power tools and build things, I have forgotten more than 3/4 of the computer knowledge I had.
I can see what I want to say or do, but cannot get it out of the pathways of my brain.
It screams and yells at me to let it out, but I have no control over it.
There are times like this that it flows from me, but not very often anymore.
Well my soap opera box is weakening so I will say till next time: God Bless & Keep You & This Country of Ours!

Well here I sit at my computer, trying to figure out what to post but this disease of mine, Alzheimer's does not want to cooperate with me.
I had this wonderful post in my head and well I guess it is lost among my brain cells.
This is a very frustrating time for me, see for the first 10 years with this friend of mine I was still able to function brain wise to an extent, now I get confused more, remember less and even forget what I am doing.
It is part of the process and not much I can do about it.
This is what makes me angry and strike out at people and go into tirades.
The loss of my independence to go and do as I want is no longer mine.
It is hard to explain to others what it is really like.
You have to live here in my world and walk the corridors of my mind to know, but I think it would scare the hell out of you it sure does me.

Today I was listening to an Internet Infomercial to cure Alzheimer's with this special diet that has cured over 47,000 people World Wide.
Yes, you to can get this miracle food receipe for the small sum of $37.00, what Bull Shit.
This crap erks me, and the people who fall for it.
I know they want to get rid of the disease, but it just does not work that way.
I wish it did, but the fact is you get it, Alzheimer's and other dementia's get worse and we die from them, PERIOD!
If I could i would remove all this crap from the internet, but unfortunately not possible.
I just keep trying to warn those of us that suffer from Alzheimer's, Dementia, Parkinson's, ALS, PCA, Vascular Dementia, Lewy Bodies, etc., if all this stuff truly worked we all would be cured.
I notice the Coconut Oil cure is not heard of anymore.
My friends to cure or halt a disease, you need to know the cause, and we do not know the cause of most dementia's, a few we do and can treat to some extent.
I am not an "EXPERT", but for 12 years I have lived in this world and watched friends die and get worse by the day.
For some reason I am still here, maybe because I am such a PITA (pain in the ass), neither heaven or hell want me.
My days are not all fun and games and wonderfull, most of the time I just sit and try to figure out who, what and where am I and why am I.  I get no answers anymore.
I use to talk to myself, it was the only way I got answers that made sense, now?
I can start things, but finishing them is another story, I just stop and forget all about them and even wonder why I am doing them in the first place.
I am becoming more demanding and hostile these days and finding it difficult to control my anger and keeping my mouth shut.
I no longer have the control and probably never did.

Well, here I am sitting again and trying to think of what it is I want to say.
The last couple of months for me have been difficult.
Too many people here and staying with us, it drives me crazy.
The activity confuses me the conversations escape me and I just sit like a bump on the log.
The longer I am still in this world of mine, the harder it is to get around.
I do not understand why I still am here after dealing with Alzheimer's, Frontoltemporal Dementia and life in general.
I was to be gone by now.
It is hard for me to really tell my feelings anymore.
I feel most of the time like I walk into one wall, bounce off of it into another and the cycle continues all day and night.
Now if I even get up late my whole day is off and I forget what I am to do.
Change is becoming near unmanagable and I once loved it and thrived on it, not anylonger.
It seems that these diseases or conditions, whatever the hell you want to call them have their own agenda, it is like dancing with someone and you do not hear the music or know the steps.
It is probably me, but friends ask for help and you do what you can, but whrn you ask they seem to be not really interested.
My brain hurts, what there is of it.
A warning do not believe all the illusions put out on the web, causes, cures and the other shit, because that is all it is.
The reality of all this is there is no cure, they do not know what causes most of all Dementia and cannot really help us.
If the could you would see people wearing T-shirts saying I Survived Dementia or Alzheimer's, or the such.
Fact is we Do NOT.
God Bless & Keep You & This Country of Ours!

I have not really written how me and Alzheimer's are getting along of late.
Well, i am able to put together a post in my wandering brain cells; but then I have a very difficult time getting it down to my fingers to type.
Once I manage to get my fingers ready with the post, then the problem of getting them to type is all together another story.
When all is ready to go, I have to remember to get to my computer and then to the post section, many is the time when I finally get there everything else is gone out the window.
I sleep a great deal during the day and night, I am getting more and more confused and forgetful, wow what a surprise.
I was sitting this morning on the bench we have near the front window and staring at the area rug on the floor.
We have had this rug for maybe 5 years or so and I just noticed and told Lynn that there was green in the rug.
She sat next to me and said that was why she was shocked when I said that I like the rug.
See I do not like green on furniture, drapes, rugs, walls or clothing, GREEN is for plants, grass and money only.
I watched 60 minutes this weekend, because they were having the Alzheimer's study breakthrough.
What a waste the information they gave has been posted on my blog and others years ago.
We know that there is a mutated gene that is carried by the people in that town in Columbia and it means Alzheimer's is coming to you 100%.
Dr. Oz I think it was a couple of years ago had a family from Michigan I think, that carry the gene, six siblings were on and five had the signs already in their 40's and the one sister was ok and caring for them.
I was happy to hear them admit that amyloid beta plaques and tau tangles, when pressed by the reporter, may not prove to be the problem and they will have waisted 15+ years of research.
Wow where have I heard that before.
When, can someone tell me that these so called brilliant people will get the heads out of their collective asses and start looking for the real cause?
Well HAPPY HOLIDAYS to you all.
God Bless and Keep You and This Country of Ours!

Remember the lady basketball coach who just died from Alzheimer's.
The press was all over HER story from the start.
God she was just a saint.
Well how many of you heard about Marty?
I live in San Diego County, where he was coach for the Chargers, not much said about it.
Can I say SEXIST media, or am I politically incorrect.
Well if so to fricken bad.
He was a winning coach and a very smart man.
I am not singing his praises personally I did not like him and am not by any means a Chargers fan.
What I am saying, I think is that his battle is just as important as anyone else's and because of his status it should be covered just as Coach Pat Summit was!
I also have been reading a lot of posts on new studies, cures, causes, etc.
Boy some of you out there are repeating OLD NEWS, that went nowhere.
There is no diet, no pill no anything that stops or cures Alzheimer's.
What is it that you do not understand?
Testy yes I am, tired of all the bull shit being spewed out.
The Snake Oil Peddlers.
Remember Coconut Oil, the cure, I said BS when I first was told of it, well it wall rampit on the net, have you heard of anyone cured from it?
The answer I will help you is NO.
Not a rap on Coconut Oil, it has its' qualities, but curing Alzheimer's or any form of dementia, sorry not so.
I beg you all do not fall for the diets, drinks and other crap being promoted as a cure.
If you pay attention I think eating potato chips will be either the next cause or cure for Alzheimer's.
Seems everything now is linked to or is a cause of the disease or it can cure it.
I VOTE FOR TOLIET PAPER AS THE ROOT CAUSE OF DEMENTIA!!!!!!

Hydrocephalus: An Often Misdiagnosed, Treatable Brain Condition September was Hydrocephalus Awareness Month.
Never heard of this condition?
You're not alone.
Often referred to as a treatable form of dementia, Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (NPH) is a chronic neurological disorder where an accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) causes the fluid-filled ventricles in the brain to gradually enlarge, sometimes with little or no increase in intracranial pressure.
While NPH can occur in adults of any age, it disproportionately appears in older individuals, and is accompanied by some or all of a triad of symptoms that include gait disturbances, dementia, and impaired bladder control.
Left untreated, NPH can cause an individual to degenerate into what appears to be dementia and is often misdiagnosed as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's diseases.
Sometimes, this condition remains undiagnosed because symptoms are thought to be part of the aging process.
The major difference between AD and NPH is that there are treatment options for those with NPH.
The current treatment for NPH is the insertion of a shunt into the brain that diverts fluid from the brain to another part of the body to be absorbed.
Individuals successfully treated for NPH experience a partial to full regression of their symptoms, allowing them to return to normal activities of daily living.
This makes misdiagnosis even more troublesome, as those who could be receiving treatment are not, leading to otherwise avoidable progression of the degeneration and, in many cases, unnecessary placement in assisted living facilities or nursing homes.
If you're interested in receiving a new diagnosis or don't know what to ask when looking for a second opinion, visit the Hydrocephalus Association's Physicians Directory page: http://www.hydroassoc.org/physicians-directories/.
You can also help spread the word about this condition by posting a video of how you #MakeWaves for hydrocephalus awareness on your Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram account.
Your post could be featured on the Hydrocephalus Association's social media pages!
For more information and examples of waves, please visit http://www.hydroassoc.org/makewaves/.
The above post was provided by Make Waves to help with awareness of NPH which is sometimes diagnosed as Alzheimer's.
It is the purpose of this blog to bring all the info possible concerning different forms of dementia.
Thank you Martha Pace for the posting.
God Bless and Keep You and This Country of Ours!

Yes I am still here.
Have not been around for awhile, not quiet sure where I was, but it was not here brain wise that is.
Touble remembering what I am doing again and what day it is or what I want to say.
Try as one might to fight and do things to help maintain some type of normal life, whatever that is this disease good old Alzheimer's just keeps marching on.
I have been reading some so called new developments and they always say that maybe this might help by the year 215637, they still have their heads up their ass.
As you know about 72% of all Alzheimer's deaths' (360,000 aprrox.)
more than lung cancer and breast cancer combined are women.
Yes that is a fact.
Why nobody seems to know.
I have a thought, yes I still have them, Copper.
Yes the heavy metal copper is linked (not a cause) to Alzheimer's.
Seems that 49yr olds and such are getting Alzheimer's more frequently.
Well guess what ladies, you know that little pill you have been taking for 30+ years or so or the iud all contain copper.
Maybe not a significant amount but over the years it adds up.
Go study how the body handles heavy metals, little hint it stores them in your bones, when it cannot flush them all out.
Blood tests do not tell the answer unless you receive massive doses.
Only true way to rid you system, men this is for you also, is to have intervenious Cheleation done.
I am sure I will here what a putz I am but that is ok. Mercury and Aluminum are also linked to Alzheimer's.
You in my group generation old, mercury fillings in the teeth.
Gov.
alows for a certain amount of lead in your system, thanks you very much shoot me in the head.
No amount of lead in your system or any heavy metal is acceptable or condusive to good health.
See brain is active at the moment.

Last night Alzheimer's set free one of the most beloved movie comedians of our time, Gene Wilder.
Known for Willie Wonka and The Chocolate Factory, The Producers and one of my very favorites, Young Frankenstein.
He and Mel Brooks (long time friend) together gave us all many great moments at the movies.
Gene you will be remembered and it is our loss.
But as for me, I am glad you are now finally free from this viscious and ravaging disease of Alzheimer's.
Go with the Lord my friend.

For some reason lately I have gotten emails about my being a caregiver and how do I handle things, PEOPLE I HAVE ALZHEIMER'S, am not a caregiver as you know one to be.
So I thought I would formalllly introduce to you MEAN LYNN P, my caregiver par excellent.
She has developed many ways of handling me, but she has now taken on a new trick: Yes there she is, taking caregiving to new hieghts, she has no choice with me but to come up with new methods of dealing with me.
I will continue to drive her crazy.
See my brain has figured out how to out smart this disease and her, the right side moved to the left and the left to the right.
Now the pulses are really a mess.

I am posting an email I received.
Follow the link and check out the site.
Interesting, your thoughts would be appreciated> Dear Sir / Madam, Good day.
After reading your blog, I hope this email will give Alzheimer's and dementia patients a glimpse of hope.
With a deep passion to find a solution for Alzheimer's and dementia, Dr. Takehiko Fujino (Emeritus Professor of Kyushu University, Japan) led a research team to conduct the world's first clinical trial of Scallop-derived PLASMALOGEN.
Based on the clinical data, intake of this plasmalogen improved cognitive function, emotional and behavioral problems (such as hallucination and delusion) in Alzheimer's and other dementia patients.
Some patients showed dramatic changes just 2 weeks after taking this plasmalogen.
I am lucky enough to have the privilege as part of this project to raise awareness for Alzheimer's and dementia as well as to support and empower the sufferers and their caregivers to improve their quality of life.
I understand that taking care of a loved one with Alzheimer's or dementia can be overwhelming and stressful.
I hope this email can make the caregivers aware of available option from natural dietary supplementation, which might be able to help their loved ones.
If you are interested to find out more about Scallop-derived PLASMALOGEN, you can visit http://plasmalogen.me/.
Alternatively, please free feel to email me and I am happy to have more meaningful conversations with you.
Thank you.
Yours faithfully, Dr.

Many of you who have followed my blog for some time, also read I Hate Alzheimer's by Dr. Joseph Sivack.
Doc has not posted is some time and we are still close friends.
He and his have been traveling and moving to find the right spot to get away from Minnesota winters.
Well, I am happy to tell you that Doc is still alive and thriving and Living in the Land of Oranges.
Yes, Florida.
Exactly where is up to him to let you know.
He still has access to post on my blog.
Many of you know he wrote; When Can I Go Home.
His story of caregiving to his mother who had Alzheimer's.
He now has problems with his eyes, I guess that is because he is a psychiatrist and has seen too many things in people's brains that have taken their toll.
Well back to my world to figure out where I am.

"Sir" or "Gentlemen" Mack Rice as he was known was set free from Alzheimer's a week ago.
Many may wonder who was Mack Rice.
Well he was a good friend of Wilson Pickett.
You say ok and what does that mean.
You see Mack wrote a song that Wilson made into a smash, you may remember MUSTANG SALLY, or Respect Yourself that he co-composed.
Mack was 82 when he passed.
"Sir" Mack was known for his musical abilities, but more so for the gentle soul he was.
The world will miss him.
So long "Sir" Mack!!!!

As I read and see different individuals that live in this World that I do get set free often I am sadden by their leaving.
Especially Today as I learned that my longtime compadre in this battle passed in March of this year.
Doreen suffered several falls a few years back that caused her to stop blogging, you can find her blog on this site.
Alzheimer's takes lives in many ways, infections, cancer and yes falls that create injury.
You see we that walk this road do not always know we are sick until.
Fall oooooh yes, I know much about losing one's balance and leg abilities.
See mine tremble when I stand, when I walk down an incline they run away with me and whoever is with me has to act like an anchor to hold me back.
I fall out of bed, now it rests on the floor, slip on rugs walk into walls.
I understand the throughs that my friend Doreen went through, now she is free.
Walk with the Lord my friend.

Alzheimer's after 5 years of living with it has finally set Pat Summit free.
She was 64, this is not an old peoples disease folks.
Wake up it is comming to a place near you if not you.
For many years on this blog I have tried to make sure people know the truth about this disease and the battles that those of us who have Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia fight.
Two to ten years is the life span after diagnosis.
Yes some of us live longer with it, we are the unfortunate one's.
Coach Summit is just another to prove the span after diagnosis.
That is become it comes to late.
Early Onset comes on very early in a person, sometime in the 40s but the medical field believes only what is written shall we say on page 87 (just an example) and it can be no other way.
Alzheimer's, Frontoltempral Dementia, Vascular Dementia, Parkinson's, Dementia, Lewy Bodies with Dementia, ALS, PCA all kill and rob people of who they are PERIOD.
Yet well over 100 years later after it being defined we are NO FARTHER ALONG in being able to help those, like myself, to stop it, slow it down or really treat symptoms.
So Coach Summit you are now free to coach in God's League with clear mind and body.
You have been set free, Alzheimer's lost when it took you Life, YOU WON.
God Bless & Keep You & This Country of Ours!

At the age of 52 the founder of The Beastie Boys, rock band, has died from Frontotemporal Dementia.
John was born in September of 1959.
He had over 25 yrs in the music business when the problems of this disease started its' manifestations.
I know how he must have felt because I also suffer from FTD, formerly called Picks.
Goodbye, my friend, you are now home and no more suffering.

Back in January I joined a study to help with Alzheimer's.
It was not for a cure or the real cause, it was to see if it could be slowed and give back some of that which a person had lost.
Most of you know I think most of the studies are crap and accomplish nothing.
I got involved because this was one that had no preconceptions of the disease.
It involved the whole person.
Not just the normal tau protein's and tangles.
It approached Alzheimer's and Dementia more as an auto immune disease, where the entire person needed to be treated.
It covered the chemicals in the brain, blood, organs, emotions, physical being and the spiritual side of the individual.
Well I finished my current involvement on 5/6/2016.
The conclusion is that I have a 25% improvement in my over all being.
Here is what I can tell you.
I have lost about 20 pounds, I am finally after years back to walking daily.
For the first time in how long I actually used power tools.
On Monday, I helped my daughter do something that I always enjoyed, we sanded down her oak dinning table to get it ready to refinish it.
She has to decide on how she wants that process, which I am ready to do.
Six months ago this would not have happened.
I have more energy and do think a little clear, but still get confused and have problems getting things from my head to mouth still.
Guess I have head and mouth disease.
My writing is easier.
The proof is in the pudding as they say.
Time will tell how affective this was by how long improvements remain.
No claim I am cured, just better than I was and that is a success for the study in my opinion.
Also we got two new kitties and eight month old and one year old.
The one year old had left front leg removed and is in a shell, my heart said she had to come hear and we got the younger one to help her in her recovery.
So far things are slow but progress not perfection is the way.
Alzheimer's, dementia and Frontal Temporal Dementia and I are still together and will be for the duration I believe, but management without drugs, is helping to improve things, also ten thousand supplements (really not that many) are helping physically.
You maybe stuck with me for sometime to come, as long as I can break this wall between me and writing on my blog.
It still is bigger than I and wins the battles for me writing.
Until next time be good to yourselves my family.
God Bless and Keep You and This Country of Ours!

BLAZE 2/02/2002 - 04/29/2016 Good Bye my Blaze.
I promised you that when we got you from the pound that you would be with us until the end.
Your heart problems, kidney problems, your constant ear infections and messed up joints we took you as you were to help and give you a life filled with love and caring.
After you spent the better part of 5 years in the pound on and off, you came into our lives.
The last week of you life was not of quality and pained us as it surely did you.
Not eating, drinking, going to the bathroom, crawling in bed with us to snuggle and sleep, but hiding and not coming out.
So on Friday we along with your vet decided it was time for you to go and be free of your illnesses and lack of life quality.
I kissed you and told you I loved you and as we looked each other in the eyes, I saw your pain and earthly life leave you and I knew I kept my promise.
My heart  is filled with pain and a sense of loss, but I know you will always be with us.
Good Bye and Live Well With The Lord, MY FRIEND!
God Bless and Keep You and This Country of Ours!

I have joined a study on dementia called GSHS sorry do not remember what it stands for.
To me it means God Send Help Soon.
My brain is more confused then ever.
Have many highways in it that lead to nowhere.
Like with most things I have to do I get stopped at the beginning.
I have simple reports to fill out for the study - so simple that I am eight behind and need to fill them out.
Cannot tell if this is helping, just know I am doing it.
I do not understand how it is to work but what the hell, if it works will let you know.
I am pleased that I no longer get all the BS stuff on the cause and cure for Alzheimer's and dementia.
We know they do not know the cause or how to cure or even how to affect real treatment.
So I stumble and bumble along.
I have started walking with my wife, which is helping my balance to an extent and gives us some quality time though it be short.
Till nex time be good to yourselves.

It has been sometime since I posted, but I wanted to say HELLO to all of you.
Life is getting more uncomfortable.
I now hear different conversations from those I am talking  with then they are having.
My wife has learned to just go with the flow, because I cannot even speak my words correctly.
Still can write, just confuses the hell out of me.
Last  6-7 weeks have been rather difficult.
Had my annual checkup in October, got my flu and pneumonia shots.
Found out had a hernia, plaque in my carotit arteries, my heart and my neck is a mess as well.
Wnt  on two week vacation in January, visiting some of the kids.
Back a week my right kidney decided to let me know it existed for about a week.
Hernia surgery scheduled for 2/19, you guessed it did not happen.
See I got the flu and it turned into pneumonia, great for the shots.
Doc wants me to get the shiggles shot, I think will pass on that.
Finally had my operation on the 7th of March.
Still healing.
so much for life.
See you all later.

 It has been nine years this motnh that I have been posting on this blog.
I hope that I have kept to my purpose to expose both the truth and th lies regarding this disease.
I have looked at most of this years posts and they have been mostly study or info and not on my journey with Alzheimer's.
You see I no longer know what to say, this sucks.
THERE IS NO CURE, they do not even no the cause, there are no diets that really change this INSPITE of what you hear or read on the internet.
If any of this did exist, you who have your ears ringing from the news of it.
I have grown tired and wiery and quite frankly tiered of all the bs out there and the goody two shoes, doing nothing really.
All the people in the know say we are making great strides, I would like to see all that greatness.
My life has been coming more confusing as we go along.
I have more and more trouble and I keep falling asleep at this thing when I try to post or do other things.
I speak a new language now good think my wife knows it or I would be totally lost.
So I think the time to say so long has come and thank you for your friendships, kindness, good wishes and putting up with me.
Till we meet God Bless & Keep You and This Country of Ours!

It saddens me to tell you that my friend and cohort in this fight against Alzheimer's passed away on July 25, 2015.
It was not his Alzheimer's that took him but his additioal battle with throat cancer.
I have known Richard since about 2005 when we met through our blogs on Alzheimer's.
I feel the grief the family must fill, but I rejoice that my friend is finally free and able to be happy.
I am a better person for having known him, although we did have sharp disagreements.
Good Bye my friend and now you walk with the Lord, yes I am jealous.
Every year Alzheimer's claims the lives of over 500,000 people, about 1 every 67 seconds.
Where is the real out cry against this.
Not the establishment or those groups that placate them and feel a gentle approach is needed.
I suffer from the disease and say screw that idea, civial disobidence is the way, with loud marches, letter and fax campaigns and voting those out of office that do not want to fund research fully.
How did AIDS get the money, what about the 60 mile marches for breast cancer.
How did civil rights get attention and work to help make it a real part of our lives?
Richard was diagnosed in 2001 with this wonderful disease, Alzheimer's.
He outlived the normal life span of 2 - 10 years, by 4 years.
Maybe if he had not had Alzheimer's weakening his body and taking it's pound of flesh, he may have not gotten cancer.
Food for thought.
God Bless & Keep You & This Country of Ours!

EXPERT Alzheimer's or Dementia: What's the Difference?
James M. Ellison, MD, MPH Sunday, July 12, 2015 Alzheimer's disease is the most common type of Major Neurocognitive Disorder, formerly known as dementia.
Learn more about the difference between Major Neurocognitive Disorder, Mild Neurocognitive Disorder, and the pre-symptomatic phase of Alzheimer's disease.
Bill looked at his father, Walter, who for the third time was telling us about the great times he had in the army after he enlisted around 1950.
Walter became a successful engineer who worked productively into his mid-70s.
When he experienced increasing forgetfulness, he recognized the need to wind down his career.
He moved into the friendly and stimulating environment of a local assisted living facility's memory unit.
His life there was a good one.
His close family relationships continued.
He enjoyed detailed memories of the past, but recent events no longer made a lasting impression on his mind.
Bill asked me, "What is my father's diagnosis?
Is he demented?
Does he have Alzheimer's disease?
And what's the difference between dementia and Alzheimer's disease?" Everything Changed in 2013 This question often comes up in a clinical interview, and up until recently the answer would have been that dementia is diagnosed when a person has a severe memory problem in addition to difficulty with language or another cognitive function, and that Alzheimer's disease is the most common type of dementia.
In 2013, though, everything changed.
The new psychiatric Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM 5) renamed "dementia" as "Major Neurocognitive Disorder" and added a new, less severe category of cognitive difficulty called Mild Neurocognitive Disorder.
Major Neurocognitive Disorder is diagnosed when disturbance of a single cognitive ability is severe enough to interfere with independence and the disturbance is not caused by drug use, delirium, or various other medical or psychiatric conditions.
The cognitive abilities that are tested for this diagnosis are: complex attention; language; executive function (which are skills that enable people to plan, organize, remember things, prioritize, or pay attention to tasks,  for example); visuospatial function (the visual  perception  of  spatial  relationships  among  objects;, memory; and social cognition.
Where Does Alzheimer's Fit In?
Alzheimer's disease is the most common type of Major Neurocognitive Disorder, but it is only one of many possible causes.
Vascular cognitive impairment, dementia with Lewy bodies, frontotemporal dementia, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, HIV, traumatic brain injury, and other conditions each can cause severe cognitive changes.
Mild Impairment Mild Neurocognitive Disorder (formerly called mild cognitive impairment or MCI), by contrast, is diagnosed when a less severe cognitive problem exists, manifested as difficulty with one of the six listed mental functions (listed above) that is significant enough to require compensatory activities, such as writing everything down in order to remember.
Mild Neurocognitive Disorder, by definition, is not bad enough to rob a person of basic independence.
The DSM 5 says that one possible cause of Mild Neurocognitive Disorder is Alzheimer's disease, but it is only one of many medical or psychiatric conditions that can cause this clinical condition.
In other words, Alzheimer's disease can be present without Major Neurocognitive Disorder or dementia, and dementia can be present without Alzheimer's disease.
Alzheimer's Begins Years before Symptoms are Apparent The DSM 5's new definitions followed a series of very influential articles published by Alzheimer's disease researchers in 2011.
These experts encouraged us to recognize Alzheimer's disease as a disease pathology rather than as a clinical syndrome.
In other words,  to understand that the effects of Alzheimer's disease on the brain begin many years before memory loss or behavioral changes become apparent.
The 2011 expert statement defined three stages of Alzheimer's disease.
The dementia (Major Neurocognitive Disorder) phase is only the final stage.
Earlier symptoms are recognizable in a symptomatic, pre-dementia phase (Mild Neurocognitive Disorder).
With amyloid PET scanning or various other biomarker measurements, doctors can also determine the presence of Alzheimer's disease pathology in the brains of people with no apparent clinical symptoms.
This is the asymptomatic, or pre-symptomatic phase of Alzheimer's disease.
The illustration below shows that Alzheimer's disease can manifest itself with clinical symptoms ranging from none to major.
Alzheimer's, however, is not the only cause of Major Neurocognitive or Mild Neurocognitive disorders.
A Diagnosis and an Important Question When Walter was examined further in our clinic, we decided that his memory troubles were indeed the result of Alzheimer's disease.
He had Major Neurocognitive Disorder and we were unable to identify any other medical or psychiatric disorder that could be responsible for his condition.
An amyloid PET scan of Walter's brain would likely have showed accumulation of beta amyloid, the disease-associated protein found in the brains of people with Alzheimer's.
Bill asked, "What about me?
Will I get Alzheimer's disease?" What we know now from biomarker research allows us to answer Bill's question in a way that would not have been possible for past generations.
We can tell Bill that he definitely does not have dementia, and that if he has Alzheimer's disease it is in the pre-symptomatic stage.
Occurrence of the disease in his father puts Bill at a small increased risk, so we'll watch him in the future.
For the present, we'll encourage him to adopt a brain-healthy lifestyle that includes management of chronic medical diseases, stress reduction, healthy eating habits, adequate sleep, plenty of physical activity, engagement with others, and cognitive stimulation.
Of course, this brain healthy lifestyle is a good prescription for all of us!

We urge young, healthy people to think now about what they might want under those circumstances, to talk about it now with loved ones and to write it down now in a state-approved form.
ADs are of particular importance for persons with dementia, because nearly all dementias are  progressive.
Therefore, individuals with dementia can be expected to decline to a state in which they can no longer communicate their treatment wishes.
They are then dependent upon caregivers, family, surrogates and physicians to make their healthcare decisions.
Ideally, anyone who is diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease has long ago completed an AD, or does so soon after diagnosis.
But reality is never ideal.
And even if healthcare decisions are written down in black and white, what of the other decisions that may need to be made throughout the life of a person with Alzheimer's?
When is the patient competent?
When is he/she not?
Generally, a person is considered legally incapacitated when two doctors have tested and examined the patient and completed certificates of incompetency.
When There Is No Advance Directive When there is no AD and family and professionals are assessing the competence of a person with Alzheimer's, the Alzheimer's Association urges "the least restrictive alternatives"--in other words, choose to protect the person's right to make his/her own decisions whenever possible.
The Association endorses other principles that protect what it calls "respect for authority": *                            The wishes of a person with dementia should be considered whenever possible and until safety becomes an issue.
*                            Diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease alone is not an indication of incompetence.
*                            Competent people have a right to reject any medical treatment.
Many people with mild or moderate dementia retain this right, and it should be protected.
*                            A person with Alzheimer's disease may lack capacities to drive, handle financial affairs or live independently in the community, but retain the capacity to make competent decisions about place of residence and medical care at the end-of-life.
*                            Appointing a legal guardian for specific tasks, such as financial affairs, might allow a person with Alzheimer's disease to maintain a degree of independence over other matters.
*                            Being uninhibited, remiss about hygiene, inclined to mishaps or unable to keep things tidy does not indicate mental incompetence.
*                            It may be appropriate to appoint a legal guardian to make decisions about property or finances, for example, yet leave other decisions--perhaps personal care, food, shelter and medical care--to the person with Alzheimer's disease.
The Importance of Legal Documents It is important to plan for the incompetence of advanced dementia via legal documents, many of which vary according to the state in which the person lives.
The most common include: *                            Advance directives: Oral and written instructions about one's future medical care, including the naming of a healthcare agent and acceptable life-sustaining procedures, in case one is unable to speak for oneself.
It can take the place of two individual documents: the living will and the durable power of attorney for healthcare (also referred to as healthcare power of attorney, healthcare proxy and appointment of a healthcare agent).
*                            Living will, which establishes one's wishes concerning end-of-life care, the use of life-support systems and the treatments one does and does not want.
*                            Durable power of attorney for healthcare, which assigns decision-making authority on medical matters to a particular person if one is no longer competent.
*                            Estate will, which describes how one's property will be dealt with after death.
*                            Plans for one's future care needs.
*                            Research directives to allow one's participation in research studies.
An Advance Directives Specifically for Alzheimer's Patients In the last several years a new advance directive has been developed allowing people coping with Alzheimer's disease and dementia to document what their lives will be like when they are no longer competent.
Called the "Alzheimer's Disease and Dementia Mental Health Advance Directive," it is legal in some states.
It's value, however, is not in its legality, but in its comprehensive look at life with Alzheimer's.
Issues include where you will live, how to finance your care, changes in an intimate relationship, when to stop driving and how pets will be cared for.
Filling it out sends a message: I do not want another's judgment substituted for my own.
Whether or not the document is legal in your state, it is a clear guideline for loved ones.
A two-page "Values Worksheet" at the end of the six-page AD helps people think through their options.
It can be filled out and shared with family, serve as a springboard to discussions or work literally as a worksheet.
Questions of Competency By documenting your desires and care goals when you are well enough to make decisions, you remove a burden from your loved ones and exert more control on future decisions.
Early documentation also prevents questions later about whether you had the capacity to make the directive when you did.
(You cannot make any directive after you become incapacitated.)
If the person with Alzheimer's is no longer competent and has completed no directive, decisions generally fall to the spouse.
If that person is not able to do the job, decisions fall to the oldest child.
A better approach than asking any one person to be responsible is for the whole family to talk about the person with Alzheimer's, how he lived and what he believed in.
General agreements about what he would want help avoid family rifts when a difficult decision--like resuscitation or feeding tubes--must be decided.
We have the right to make our own healthcare decisions--even when we have Alzheimer's disease.
Making advance directives is not only a gift to loved ones, it's a gift to the person with Alzheimer's.

I have heard some noise about a study in Australia, where APPARENTLY they claim to have reversed and "cured" some with Alzheimer's.
Since this has been very sparce I wonder about it.
I will try and get more info and post what I find out.
I am always suspect of this kind of stuff.
Well off hunting I shall go, with blazing speed, you know slow.
That is me today and trying to put a post together is difficult.
Wife sys when you think of something write it down.
Then put ideas together in a post.
Easy for her to say, by the time I go to write it down I forget have of it..
I just cleared my desk of so much junk.
That is a problem, I write it down in my own language and then look at it and wonder what the hell.
Life sucks now, I keep taking these trips to the floor and out of bed again.
All part of the process Nice thig I am forgetting a lot out of the past.
Hell remembering this morning is a job.
I have a new cat, got her from the pound about year ago, see how fast I remember to share things.
She is a calico colored persian.
We took her because she was 13, no one wanted her with her health problems.
So she is with us and healthier and even is finally beginning to learn how to play.
She has dementia forgets things quickly, fits in perfectly.
God Bless & Keep You & This Country of Ours!

Following is an email I received requesting help.
_____________________________________________________________________________ It is only with the help of people  who participate in clinical trials that we can learn more about Alzheimer's disease and help find  effective treatments.
There is the satisfaction of knowing that you are helping others and potentially  future generations.
As a study participant in a clinical trial, Alzheimer's patients and their  caregivers have access to a healthcare team who may help you understand Alzheimer's better.
Currently three studies are underway to investigate whether a research drug called idalopirdine, given in  addition to the Alzheimer's medicine, donepezil, rivastigmine or galantamine, improves brain  functioning in areas such as memory, thinking and reasoning.
It is important to note that idalopirdine  has already been tested in clinical studies with promising results.

May is celebrated as being National Health Month.
American Recall Center is one of those online places that you can go to get information on drugs, etc.
Personally I feel that one should always check out their drugs no matter what the Dr. says.
They are not able to know all of the affects on all the thousands of drugs available.
I believe in follow their directions, but I want all the info I can get on what is going in my body.
Having Alzheimer's and Frontal Temporal Lobe Dementia, I need to be careful with what I take.
Many meds are NG for dementia suffers and can cause many problems.
When first I was diagnosed, I was put on Aricept and then Namenda as well and things seemed to not improve.
In fact I had three different Neurologists tell me to trash them that they in their practices had not noticed any benefits.
To tell you the facts I felt better once I stopped them.
But you need to talk to your doctor, I am not one.
I am more on mood stabilizers and anti-siezure meds, which help me to stay as focused as my 1/2 of brain cell will handle.
I also take supplements, like Mega Vitamin B complex, Vitamin D3, Fish Oil, some natural remedy for the ringing and humming in my ears.
I find that all of this seems to help me the most.
I did try Coconut Oil, oh well for me it went the way of Aricept and Namenda no help at all, except my skin got a little nicer.
So take a closer look at your meds.
learn what you can, do not stop taking them without talking to your doctor.
check out American Recall Center.
you just may find the info you need.
Till next time stay well.
Today I took another trip on the stairs, this Alzheimer's is screwing things up well now, but I still have you to come to.

My old friend Alzheimer's has been hugging me more tightly these days.
Guess the old bugger just cannot get enough of me.
I find that conversations are very different from what I now hear.
Seems to be getting harder to talk with folks.
Once I am on a roll it is ok, but let something interrupt me and who the hell knows where I am then.
I am getting testier with those around me, just have to sometimes cannot keep it in.
Hidding my wonderfull world of dementia does not work to well anymore, but I guess that is the way it is to be.
Have been reading about some of the simillairities between Lewy Bodies and Parkinson's.
Now I understand why Parkinson's is a form of dementia.
Well is it Alzheimer's or Schizophrenia??
My doc thinks I am a bit schizo and has for years.
Maybe it is not Alzheimer's or Schizophrenia, could be Alzhphrenia a new type of dementia.
The following is an interesting look into the brain.
Brain's dementia weak spot identified By Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online 25 November 2014   From the sectionHealth The brain has a weak spot for Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia, according to UK scientists who have pinpointed the region using scans.
The brain area involved develops late in adolescence and degenerates early during ageing.
At the moment, it is difficult for doctors to predict which people might develop either condition.
The findings, in the journal PNAS, hint at a potential way to diagnose those at risk earlier, experts say.
Although they caution that "much more research is needed into how to bring these exciting discoveries into the clinic".
Early doctors called schizophrenia 'premature dementia' but until now we had no clear evidence that the same parts of the brain might be associated with two such different diseasesProf Hugh Perry of the MRC Weak spot The Medical Research Council team who carried out the study did MRI brain scans on 484 healthy volunteers aged between eight and 85 years.
The researchers, led by Dr Gwenaelle Douaud of Oxford University, looked at how the brain naturally changes as people age.
The images revealed a common pattern - the parts of the brain that were the last to develop were also the first to show signs of age-related decline.
These brain regions - a network of nerve cells or grey matter - co-ordinate "high order" information coming from the different senses, such as sight and sound.
When the researchers looked at scans of patients with Alzheimer's disease and scans of patients with schizophrenia they found the same brain regions were affected.
The findings fit with what other experts have suspected - that although distinct, Alzheimer's and schizophrenia are linked.
Prof Hugh Perry of the MRC said: "Early doctors called schizophrenia 'premature dementia' but until now we had no clear evidence that the same parts of the brain might be associated with two such different diseases.
This large-scale and detailed study provides an important, and previously missing, link between development, ageing and disease processes in the brain.
"It raises important issues about possible genetic and environmental factors that may occur in early life and then have lifelong consequences.
The more we can find out about these very difficult disorders, the closer we will come to helping sufferers and their families."
Dr Michael Bloomfield of University College London said: "Schizophrenia can be potentially devastating but at the moment it's very difficult to predict with certainty who is going to have a good prognosis and who might have a poor one.
"This study brings us a step closer to being able to make this prediction, so patients could in the future receive better targeted treatments."

Hi to All!
I have not posted alot lately regarding me and my journey with Alzheimer's.
I am starting to have great difficulty in getting what is in my brain cell to my fingers.
Somewhere on it's journey from brain to fingers it gets lost or just plain nothing.
I have been fortunate for sometime to be able to communicate here with all of you.
But it seems the disease is starting to take what it feels rightfully belongs to it.
It is taking a physical toll on me as well.
Greedy bastard that it is.
I do not write much about going here or there, because I feel that my mission on this blog is to talk about what the disease really does.
Once again I have started getting this crap on how to prevent Alzheimer's or dementia in and of it self.
How to cure it.
Boils down to the same old bullshit nothing.
The new studies and trials that promise so much, suddenly you stop hearing about them, why because they all fail.
To many restrictions on reasearch and movement of possible drugs to the market.
Smaller brained powered individuals then myfelf  making life decisions for you and me, makes no sense.
I guess 57+ people dieing each day from the Alzheimer's is of no importance to those that try to govern our lives and tell us how they will take care of us.
I say stick it up your already clogged lower intestine.
We need to force the issue.
Not by kissing up to them, but getting on the unemployment lines and start our revolution to first an understanding of the cause, then how to prevent it where we can (if that is possible), find real treatments that work and not just mask symptoms until they stop and leave the person hanging on the cliff.
Sounds a bit political, right?
Well the time has come for us to go into action.
It is clear those claiming to help us, really have not come much more than a foot in well over 100 years.
God Bless & Keep You & This Country of Ours!

FEBRUARY 18, 2015 What is Vascular Dementia?
Vascular dementia is one of the 3 leading causes of dementia.
When it appears together with Alzheimer's disease, which it does quite often, it is called "Mixed dementia".
Learn what causes it and how to identify different types.
Vascular Dementia and Vascular Cognitive Impairment Vascular dementia and vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) are caused by injuries to the vessels supplying blood to the brain.
These disorders can be caused by brain damage from multiple strokes or any injury to the small vessels carrying blood to the brain.
Dementia risk can be significant even when individuals have suffered only small strokes.
Vascular dementia and VCI arise as a result of risk factors that similarly increase the risk for cerebrovascular disease (stroke), including atrial fibrillation, hypertension, diabetes, and high cholesterol.
Vascular dementia also has been associated with a condition called amyloid angiopathy, in which amyloid plaques accumulate in the blood-vessel walls, causing them to break down and rupture.
Symptoms of vascular dementia and VCI can begin suddenly and progress or subside during one's lifetime.Some types of vascular dementia include:Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL).
This inherited form of cardiovascular disease results in a thickening of the walls of small- and medium-sized blood vessels, eventually stemming the flow of blood to the brain.
It is associated with mutations of a specific gene called Notch3, which gives instructions to a protein on the surface of the smooth muscle cells that surround blood vessels.
CADASIL is associated with multi-infarct dementia, stroke, migraine with aura (migraine preceded by visual symptoms), and mood disorders.
The first symptoms can appear in people between ages 20 and 40.
Many people with CADASIL are undiagnosed.
People with first-degree relatives who have CADASIL can be tested for genetic mutations to the Notch3 gene to determine their own risk of developing CADASIL.Multi-infarct dementia.
This type of dementia occurs when a person has had many small strokes that damage brain cells.
One side of the body may be disproportionally affected, and multi-infarct dementia may impair language or other functions, depending on the region of the brain that is affected.
Doctors call these "local" or "focal" symptoms, as opposed to the "global" symptoms seen in AD that tend to affect several functions and both sides of the body.
When the strokes occur on both sides of the brain, however, dementia is more likely than when stroke occurs on one side of the brain.
In some cases, a single stroke can damage the brain enough to cause dementia.
This so-called single-infarct dementia is more common when stroke affects the left side of the brain--where speech centers are located--and/or when it involves the hippocampus, the part of the brain that is vital for memory.Subcortical vascular dementia, also called Binswanger's disease.
This is a rare form of dementia that involves extensive microscopic damage to the small blood vessels and nerve fibers that make up white matter, the "network" part of the brain believed to be critical for relaying messages between regions.
The symptoms of Binswanger's are related to the disruption of subcortical neural circuits involving short-term memory, organization, mood, attention, decisionmaking, and appropriate behavior.
A characteristic feature of this disease is psychomotor slowness, such as an increase in the time it takes for a person to think of a letter and then write it on a piece of paper.Other symptoms include urinary incontinence that is unrelated to a urinary tract condition, trouble walking, clumsiness, slowness, lack of facial expression, and speech difficulties.
Symptoms tend to begin after age 60, and they progress in a stepwise manner.
People with subcortical vascular disease often have high blood pressure, a history of stroke, or evidence of disease of the large blood vessels in the neck or heart valves.
Treatment is aimed at preventing additional strokes and may include drugs to control blood pressure.
Mixed Dementia Autopsy studies looking at the brains of people who had dementia suggest that a majority of those age 80 and older probably had "mixed dementia," caused by both AD-related neurodegenerative processes and vascular disease-related processes.
In fact, some studies indicate that mixed vascular-degenerative dementia is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly.
In a person with mixed dementia, it may not be clear exactly how many of a person's symptoms are due to AD or another type of dementia.
In one study, approximately 40 percent of people who were thought to have AD were found after autopsy to also have some form of cerebrovascular disease.
Several studies have found that many of the major risk factors for vascular disease also may be risk factors for AD.Researchers are still working to understand how underlying disease processes in mixed dementia influence each other.
It is not clear, for example, if symptoms are likely to be worse when a person has brain changes reflecting multiple types of dementia.
Nor do we know if a person with multiple dementias can benefit from treating one type, for example, when a person with AD controls high blood pressure and other vascular disease risk factors.See More Vascular Dementia Videos and Articles SOURCE: National Institute on Aging, National Institutes of Health   Email This BlogThis!

I am sure this will piss off many.
But kiss my ass.
For years I have been trying my damndest  to get something done for us that suffer one or another form of Dementia, you know the killer with millions and no survivors.
So one transgender girl goes out and steps in front of a truck and commits suicide and the world suddenly says OOOOOH these people need help.
Amazon.com in tribute to her is offering new customers Prime for one yea at $72.00 in her honor.
Well fuck me please.
I can understand her wanting to leave a life that is fucked up for her.
See I feel the same about mine, but when I expressed that feeling in an HBO documentary The Alzheimer's Project, you can find a link to it on my blog, I was chastised by I cannot tell you how many people.
It is a wonderful and selfless act she has preformed to bring attention to her plight, but for me to do the same thing OH NO, i am selfish, I would run family lives, etc.
Well what the hell did she do.
This is not a shame on her post, I understand her wanting to leave a life she could nolonger live in or function in.
I feel that pain daily and have for 10 years.
This is a SHAME on YOU post for not helping us that are dying daily from our disease.
Yes all the so called Alzheimer groups out there and our government who cannot get their heads out of their asses.
Leelah Alcorn is now free of her torment.
May God keep her close and wrapped in his arms, I for one feel the pain she had.
I have now found out that that I have vascular calcification taking place in my muscle tissue in both my kneck and spine, oooh goody now I am a real hard head.
This only leads to stroke, death and if I am truly lucky Vascular Dementia, I will have a trifecta, Alzheimer's, Frontal Temporal Dementia and Vascular Dementia.
Is it ok with you now if i still am considering setting my self free?
NOW WHEN DO YOU ALL GET OFF YOUR FLAT BUTTS AND HELP US?

Joseph,  In just five days, President Obama will deliver the  State of the Union address.
Washington and the nation will pause to hear the  president's vision, and we need him to publicly commit to stopping Alzheimer's.
The nation already has adopted a national plan that sets as goal one preventing  and treating Alzheimer's by 2025.
But this is now just 10 years away and much  work remains.
President Obama could issue a "moon shot" for ending  Alzheimer's, like John F. Kennedy did for a moon landing in 1961.
But it won't  happen absent a relentless push by those impacted by this dreaded disease.
Help us plant a flag for ending Alzheimer's by  adding your voice now.
Join with our USAgainstAlzheimer's networks and thousands  of activists nationwide to encourage the president to address Alzheimer's during  his speech.
Click  here to take a moment to ask President Obama to set a marker for ending  Alzheimer's in his State of the Union on Tuesday.
The annual global cost of treating Alzheimer's in  2010 was an estimated $604 billion - one percent of global GDP.
Without  new treatments, the number of Alzheimer's cases and its associated costs are  predicted to quadruple in the next 40 years.
That's not even mentioning the personal toll it  takes on families.
More than 5 million Americans suffer from this cruel,  unforgiving disease, and their loved ones suffer along with them.
We can't wait for action.
If we are going to stop  this terrifying trajectory, we need to get bold.
We need leadership.
President Obama has a chance to cast a  vision for ending Alzheimer's during his speech.
We need to let him know how  important it is that he does.
Add  your name: Call on President Obama to address the threat of Alzheimer's in his  State of the Union address.
There's a path to a cure, but it demands commitment  from everyone.
If we get it, we'll beat this disease.

Anti-Aging Medicine, Science & Engineering Dr. Brett Osborn Anti-Aging  -  Oct 8, 2014  #AntiAging   I believe an analog of metformin will one day launch as an "anti-aging" drug due to its potentially life-extending effects.Why?
Read on.
 Life Extension... in a bottle - Dr. Brett Osborn drbrettosborn.com 4 1 Frank Rummel Oct 8, 2014 + 121     The controversial study in question here (Can people with type 2 diabetes live longer than those without?
A comparison of mortality in people initiated with metformin or sulphonylurea monotherapy and matched, non-diabetic controls by C. A. Bannister et al) was published behind a paywall in the journal Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism.
For a critique of this story, consider what Prof Kevin McConway, Professor of Applied Statistics, The Open University, said:"The title of this paper itself is not helpful in that anyone reading it might get the wrong idea - this study cannot actually answer the question it poses ("Can people with type 2 diabetes live longer than those without?") for reasons discussed below, and it sounds almost as if there are grounds to advise people without diabetes to take metformin.
But in fact the study isn't saying that at all."In the press release, Craig Currie says "People lose on average around eight years from their life expectancy after developing diabetes" and goes on to explain why.
So if the life expectancy of people with type 2 diabetes is so much shorter, how on earth can they "live longer than people without the disease", as the title of the release and the paper both say?"The answer is that the comparison in the paper runs only over the time period when the patients with diabetes were on first-line treatment with metformin, on its own (and there's a similar comparison involving patients whose first-line treatment is with sulphonylureas).
At some point after this first-line treatment starts, many of the patients with diabetes would be switched from metformin alone onto a second-line treatment, and this switch is (or should be) necessary because the diabetes or its effects have got worse.
But at that point the comparison in this study simply stops."So the quote in the press release about an eight year reduction in life expectancy, in people who develop type 2 diabetes, is talking about the entire rest of a person's life after the diagnosis, including the time when they might be on a more aggressive second-line treatment.
But the comparison in the paper is looking only at the time before the treatment changes.
You can't fit all that into a simple headline, but it is important to note that the story here is not so simple."But, if the survival for people with diabetes, taking metformin, is significantly better than the survival for people without diabetes, even just over the limited timespan of this study, might that still not mean that people without diabetes should take metformin in order to live longer than they otherwise would?
No, it's not saying that.
The apparent difference might be due to something other than the metformin."The researchers did match the controls with patients with diabetes in certain ways, and in their statistical analysis they try to allow statistically for other differences between the people with diabetes and the controls.
But the paper itself points out some issues.
The researchers could not take into account certain possible confounders (other variables that might affect the comparison) because they did not have data on them for enough of the controls.
Even without that important issue, statistical adjustment for confounders is never perfect.
The difference in survival between people with diabetes on metformin, and controls without diabetes, was statistically significant but in fact rather small, and probably within the range where it could be explained by residual confounding (that is, the effect of other variables that was not taken into account by the analysis)."Further, the paper itself also points out that people with diabetes are more likely be monitored for, and receive interventions for, problems with the heart and circulation.
This extra intervention and monitoring, and the possibility of residual confounding, between them cast huge doubt on the possibility that the better survival in the patients taking metformin, compared to controls without diabetes, was simply because they were taking metformin."Metformin does come out well in comparison to the other diabetes treatment looked at in the study, sulphonylureas, where survival does seem to be clearly worse than it is for control people without diabetes (the paper mentions that metformin is not suitable for some people with diabetes, hence the use of sulphonylureas).
Comparing such patients with people without diabetes does not tell us much about whether it is right to prescribe them sulphonylureas.
To investigate that, one would need to compare them with patients taking some other treatment that would also be appropriate for them (and not metformin, which is not appropriate for them), and this study didn't look at that at all."Source:http://www.sciencemediacentre.org/expert-reaction-to-study-looking-at-type-2-diabetes-metformin-and-lifespan/ I found this to be quite interesting and wanted to pass it on.

To all hello, I have been ill for awhile and am now getting back to my normal.
Life is getting more confusing and so am I. I am having more trouble with speaking correctly and getting out the right words.
I seem to be fine until 10am or so and then a wall comes up in front of me and I cannot do anything more.
I try but the body does not want to do it and my brain is unsure of it.
They are having a contest on Health Line for health blogs of all things.
Yes you can go there and vote for Living With Alzhiemers if you wish, wish hard.
Christmas is coming and I am a prepared as a dirt yard in a wind storm.
I have been posting articles of late because I cannot seem to get things to work together anymore.
It actually hurts to think now, the headaches are getting worse, my walking in circles is improving, falling has become something I can do very well.
OOOOOH the joys of it all, cannot talk right, think straight, walk well, but seem to do ok here was I get started.
Maybe because I am really talking to myself when I post.
I do that well my wife asks me often who am I talking to.
Mouth is going, hands are moving the whole show is in action, of course asking me justs ruins it because I forget.
I have others in my brain now.
Till next we meet.
God Bless & Keep You & This Country of Ours!!!!

Ronald Reagan's Alzheimer's Letter: Still Poignant After 20 Years VIDEO & ARTICLE:20 years ago, President Ronald Wilson Reagan wrote a profound letter to America about his Alzheimer's diagnosis.
It led the way in breaking down the stigma and myth surrounding Alzheimer's.
Watch Charlie Rose report on his long, private farewell, ceasing his formal, public appearances.
Read the letter.
Nov. 5 1994My Fellow Americans,I have recently been told that I am one of the Americans who will be afflicted with Alzheimer's Disease.Upon learning this news, Nancy & I had to decide whether as private citizens we would keep this a private matter or whether we would make this news known in a public way.
In the past Nancy suffered from breast cancer and I had my cancer surgeries.
We found through our open disclosures we were able to raise public awareness.
We were happy that as a result many more people underwent testing.
They were treated in early stages and able to return to normal, healthy lives.So now, we feel it is important to share it with you.
In opening our hearts, we hope this might promote greater awareness of this condition.
Perhaps it will encourage a clearer understanding of the individuals and families who are affected by it.At the moment I feel just fine.
I intend to live the remainder of the years God gives me on this earth doing the things I have always done.
I will continue to share life's journey with my beloved Nancy and my family.
I plan to enjoy the great outdoors and stay in touch with my friends and supporters.Unfortunately, as Alzheimer's Disease progresses, the family often bears a heavy burden.
I only wish there was some way I could spare Nancy from this painful experience.
When the time comes I am confident that with your help she will face it with faith and courage.In closing let me thank you, the American people for giving me the great honor of allowing me to serve as your President.
When the Lord calls me home, whenever that may be I will face it with the greatest love for this country of ours and eternal optimism for its future.I now begin the journey that will lead me into the sunset of my life.
I know that for America there will always be a bright dawn ahead.Thank you, my friends.
May God always bless you.Sincerely,Ronald Reagan SOURCE:http://www.americanpresidents.org/letters/39.asp God Bless & Keep You & This Country of Ours!!!

NOVEMBER IS NATIONAL FAMILY CAREGIVERS & ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE AWARENESS MONTH.
NovemberisNationalFamilyCaregivers&Alzheimer'sDiseaseAwarenessMonth In 1983, three years before his public letter of his own Alzheimer's diagnosis, President Ronald Reagan proclaimed the month of November to be National Alzheimer's Disease Awareness month.
Two decades and a year later, the Alzheimer's Association raises the banner on National Alzheimer's Awareness month with their Honor a Caregiver Today campaign.
Meanwhile, the Caregiver Action Network (CAN) leads us in celebrating National Family Caregiver's Month with some alarming details.
(The three links below are from CAN's website.]
Did you know that...?
Two out of every five adults are family caregivers.
Thirty-nine percent of all adult Americans are caring for a loved one who is sick or disabled - up from thirty percent in 2010.
Alzheimer's is driving the numbers up.
More than 15 million family caregivers are providing care to more than 5 million loved ones with Alzheimer's disease.
Family caregivers perform medical and nursing tasks.
Almost half of family caregivers perform complex medical/nursing tasks for their loved ones - such as managing multiple medications, providing wound care, and operating specialized medical equipment.
For information about dementia risks and reducing them and an overview of types of technologies for quality of life, click on: Infographic - What if you could reduce your risk of dementia?Five simple steps could lead you in a memorable direction.

Many of you know that I chose to stop driving almost 6 yrs ago.
But I think that this can be a touchy topic between caregiver and care receiver.
I stopped because I realised that I had become a danger to others and myself, as well as not being able to make deciions.
I will tell you that at first I had a pitty party for myself, but as time has gone by it is a good thing.
I like being driven plaes, I enjoy the driver having to put up with the BS of others not me and I can relax and enjoy the sites as I forget where we are going.
I would say that if you know one such as I and they do not belong behind the wheel (in your judgement), that you get opinions from others before you broach the topic.
See we can be very confrontational when you want to take something from us.
Never, my opinion, tell the person they are a bad driver and do not belong behind the wheel.
A more gentle approach of asking, after you have ridden somewhere with them might be, "So how do you like the traffic theses days?"
See you have laid the ground work for discussion, do not push.Maybe the next time you and someone whose opinion the person respectts, may discuss the problems you see that they seem to be having when driving, get them involved.
You might suggest a driving anallysis by a professional.
The point is is to try and get the person to give up the keys.
It is a loss of freedom no matter how you may see it.
Yes they can get rides, cab, bus, etc.
NOT THE SAME as getting up and going to the car and going where you want.
If you cannot persuade the person to stop, talk to their Dr. and see if he or she can convince them.
If not have someone other than you contact the DMV and let them handle it and remove yourself from the picture.
It is very possible tha the talk with their doctor may just be the trick, remember he/she can report the patient (you loved one) to the state licensing department.
Remember that you are asking or proposing one give up their freedom of self movement, that they probably have been doing for 50+ years or so.
How would you feel?
Think about it before you act.

Joseph, When I first heard  about what Olivia Mastry and ACT on Alzheimer's are doing in Minnesota, I had  one thought: Yes.
They've established  dementia-friendly environments in 32 different communities.
We will learn from  Olivia Mastry more about the power of dementia-friendly communities and use  their model to create dementia-friendly environments in all our  communities.
Olivia,  Executive Lead of ACT on Alzheimer's, will be joining us for our next  Alzheimer's Talks on Nov. 18 to answer questions about making your own community  dementia-friendly.
ACT on Alzheimer's  recognizes there's no one-size-fits-all solution, but they're all borne out of a  series of foundational principles you can get started on, whether in your whole  community or at your business, place of worship, etc.
Olivia will share her  recommendations, including lessons learned, and a toolkit with concrete steps in  developing a plan.
Join me to  learn more about how her work is helping those with dementia and how you can  apply ACT's vision in your community.
Please, join us for the  conversation by clicking the button below to register for our call on Tuesday,  Nov. 18, from 3 - 4 p.m. Eastern time.
The truth is, the only  way we'll end Alzheimer's and make lives better for sufferers and caregivers is  to do it together.
This innovative approach needs to expand across the country,  and I can't wait for you to learn more about it.
Sincerely, George God Bless & Keep You & This Country of Ours!

Alzheimer's Prevention Registry     US AGAINST ALZHEIMER'S PRESENTS A FREE WEBINAR: A MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH When a story on Alzheimer's research makes it to The New York Times' most-shared list, you know there's been a major breakthrough.
For the first time, researchers have been able to replicate Alzheimer's outside of the brain - they're calling it "Alzheimer's in a Dish."
This advancement will allow scientists and doctors to evaluate their experimental treatments and techniques that - until now - would have required human subjects for testing.
This could speed up the research process and help us find a way to stop Alzheimer's faster.
We're thrilled to have the head of that groundbreaking team, Dr. Rudolph E. Tanzi of Boston's Massachusetts General Hospital, join us for our next Alzheimer's Talks.
Join our conversation and hear about his plan to quickly evaluate more than 6,000 drugs - a goal that would have been out of the question just a few months ago.
I hope you can join the call.
Read the NY Times article here and click the button below to register for our call on Thursday, October 30, from 4 - 5 p.m.
ET.
Experts in the field are calling this "a real game changer" and "a giant step forward for the field."
I'm excited to learn how Dr. Tanzi and his team are moving us closer to a cure for Alzheimer's, and I'm looking forward to having you join the conversation.
Sincerely, George Vradenburg Founding Board Member USAgainstAlzheimer's     P.S.
Please note that everyone who registers will be called on Thursday, October 30 around 4 p.m.
ET and will be connected automatically to the free teleconference.
Ways you can help: Ask your family and friends to join you in learning about Alzheimer's prevention research news and opportunities Share information about the Registry in your workplace or community with our easy-to-use campaign toolkits.
80% of research studies fail to attract enough participants.
Ready to help us change that?

Hello To All, My loving, devoted, ever wonderful wife, has informed me that living with me now is like the terrible two's all over again.
Have kids you know.
At least I am having my childhood finally.
Never had one way back in prehistoric timees.
I just cannot anylonger keep my mouth shut or stay out of arguing.
They said this crap would take place and here we are in my terrrible twos and wearing depends what a life.
Have been readina lot on the internet about diets and drugs that all cure alzheimer's and prevent it.
I say watch out for this junk and snakeoil sales.
I have yet to get solid undenial proof that any diet or drug out there has stopped or curred anyone of this disease.
I have heard claims but disaster followed them and some of the people were the snake oil peddlers.
Do not grasp at straws it will  only come back to kick you in the ass 10 times over.
Have someone you trust dig into the info before you get involved.
No You Tube Claims and the like, hard undeniable facts.
The only cure for AD that I know of is DEATH period.
Oh becareful apparently everything in the world causes it as we.
Do not want to get AD go live in a bubble, eat and drink nothing and do not breathe that should do it.
Smart ass yes, but i am tired of hearing about my friends falling for this bull shit and just wind up dieing  worst off.
Take care of yourself.

I decided to finally visit my own blog.
It has only taken over a week of sitting here to finally make it.
I always have these great things to tell you, but they seem to leave faster than they come.
There is a very great disconnect between my brain and fingers and is growing so with my mouth.
I have a new pet a calico cat, we got her from the pound.
She is almost 13yrs, heart problems, ear problems, people problems, but she is so damn cute.
Took her home, after she had been there on and off, mostly on, for over a year.
Knew no one else would give her a home so we have.
Had her about 2 weeks and been to the vet twice, sounds like me.
Old, crabby and don't enjoy having people around me.
I truly do not enjoy this life anymore, it is becoming difficult now, I have no ambition nor do I care about much.
Kind of hard to care when the old brain can not remember to do so.
Slow typing is helping me spell today, tomorrow who knows.
I do miss coming here to be with you all.
I have been reading some articles and studies that are coming out saying that Alzheimer's may very well be the Number 3 killer period.
Not surprising with all the folks I know that are leaving us.
Thank you all for being here for me and allowing me to be a very small part of your lives.

Many of you may recall that several months ago, seems like a year to me, that I reported that Alzheimer's was the Number 3 leading cause of death in San Diego County, Southern California.
Well it is now official crack researchers and a right on top of things media, Yesterday, 8/4/2014 reported that they had concluded that Alzheimer's was the #3 killer here in San Diego County.
Kudoos people you are right on top of things.
I wonder if they have managed to get their collective heads out of their asses yet.
Oh well we can only hope.
This is part of why I have so much faith in the medical community, NOT.
Next big news, you are hearing it hear now.
If you combine all the deaths from all forms of Dementia, as they do for Heart Disease and Cancer, Deaths from related forms of Dementia would be number one by quite a margin, possibly equalling the other two combined.
That is the 10 forms of Alzheimer's, 4 forms of Frontal Temporal Dementia (and sub categories), Parkinson's, Vascular Dementia, Lewy Bodies with Dementia and the 30-40 other types of dementia.
Now we wait for the great ones to prove me wrong once again, so far their score is ZERO.
Yes i am in a pissy mood and feel like reaching out and shaking the so called God of Medicine's head until it cannot take enough pain killers to get rid of it's head ache.
For now I still am nuts and do not remember many things or am able to do 1 10th of what I used to do, but I am still here to rant on the medical profession until someone finally wakes up and realizes that Dementia is a true pandemic.
Speaking of that great Government and Medical Profession genius let people into this Country with Ebola, with no known cure, possible one from here in San Diego.
I know the two are Americans but they choose to go to Africa, they should have been left there and treated there.
I for one do not trust the containment proceedures.
Yes let us bring one of the most deadly diseases that only is found in Africa here.
Boy that makes a lot of sense to me.
Till next time take care and stay well.

As many of you know I self appointed myself to stand at the Gate to this World of Alzheimer's with my hand out to greet those who join our millions strong family.
Today I welcome Mr. Pat Bowlen, owner of the Denver Broncos.
Pat went public this week about his Alzheimer's: he is now 70.
He has been living with this disease for a few years now, which those of us in this family know, he has had it longer, but just was probably told medically a few years ago.
We all know how the story goes.
I want Pat to know, although he will probably never read this or be told, that anytime any day you need to talk to one in your new familly to help prepare you for the journey ahead, You can contact me, I stand here to help and tell you the truth about this disease.
Yes it is brutal, frustrating, aggrevating a pain in the ass, so on and so on.
But it does have it's moments of peace and fun actually.
We have a saying I have Alzheimer's, I am glad I do not have Alzheimer's our way of knowing how quickly we forget things.
While I was sitting here at my computer going to write this post, I fell sound asleep for awhile, part of my life now.
There are so many things I cannot do anylonger that I have forgotten some of them.
One thing I think is great abouth this disease is you forget the people and things that you really disliked and life does become less complicated.
10 years now I have been at this, statistically for both my Alzheimer's and Frontol Temporal Dementia, this is my year to go and be set free.
Some how I have a feeling that may not take place and frankly it pisses me off.
I know people get upset when I talk about today being a good day to die, but those people are not living in my head that is getting darker, foggier and less able to keep anything straight.
I get gun HOOOah on something and well suddenly it does not matter and goes away.
I have a hearing aid, well that just helps me hear things more that I don't remember, it makes sense to me even if you do not understand.
I have gone off grid I think that is the saying, I left all social media sites and other groups I belonged to, to come back home here where I belong and can be who and what I am and will be.
Pat again welcome and that is meant with a true heart.
God Bless & Keep You And This Country of Ours!!!!!

Today I learned that My Friend Carol's husband passed on.
He suffered from this disease and now he is free of it.
My prayers and praises of joy to Carol and Hubby (as I rcalled hiim).
I read on their blog about the incontence part and personally found in kind of amuszing, you see it has followed me around for over a year now, just goes with the territory.
I also have a hearing aide now and need a second go at surgery on my eyes, things just get in the way sometimes.
I have more and more moments of being somewhere and do not know about it.
Mr.
AD and FTD are claiming their territories in me , knew the day was comming so on I go.
So far I have beat the odds, probablyl because I am just an old pain in the ass and stubborn as hell.
I wake up in my dreams and continue them talking and so and then say bull and go back to sleep.
To say my life is getting interesting is a mild statement.
I still look forward to going home, any time the Big Guy decides.
Getting tired of waiting for the bus to pick me up and holding my hand out to take his.
But all in his time not mine.He runs the show I do not.
I just sit and eat popcorn and watch the screen to see what is next.
For all that celebrate JULY 4TH, have a happy and safe one, and remember all of those around the World who fought to keep Freedom alive.

I think many of you know that behind the picture of my clan, is the area we built for one of our KOI ponds.
The second one we removed sometime ago to make a garden on the other side of the yard.
Well last week was sad and happy.
See my babbies just got to damned big for the pond, they should not have, but they were going at normal rates and just to much for the pond.
So we found a KOI rescue place and now my little ones are residing elsewher with the room the need and deserve ato live out the rest of their days which will be many years.
So the pond will become a water garden.
I hve mixed feelings, personally I want the pond removed and we can make a fire pit setting or something else out of it.
My wife Lynn asked me what I wanted for Father's day, by the way a belated happy Father's day to you; it took time for me to think of an answer.
Finally with pain and sorrow my answer was "I want my Life Back" and i know noone can do that for me, except my Lord and Lately we do not seem to be on the same page let alone in the same book.
I have gotten a hearing aide for my right ear and can once again hear some things in it.
Strange feeling to say the least.
Well take care of yourselves.

I want to extend mly hand to you Ms. Smith, and say welcome to our World.
I try to greet as many new people as possible.
Regardless of the support system you may have, I want you to know that you have a family of millions standing ready to help as they are able to.
We welcome you with open arms, for we know the road you now travel and how difficult it is.
It has been a rough time for me.
My beast of humanity here, went all to hell in a hand basket and it took over a week or so to get it back to a working state.
There was a time, I could have taken care of the problems, but now I require professional help to resolve them, brain gets stuck and cannot figure out which way to go.
It is hard talking to a tech when you cannot even get the words out right and you sound like a babbeling brook or have cotton balls in your mouth.
I now have to be reminded to ddo the towels on Friday, because I just plain forget.
I take the and put the garbage out on Tuesday for pickup the next day and yes I now have to be reminded about that.
The one thing I do real good at, is falling asleep no matter where I sit anymore.
I do not even know that I have been sleeping, ecept for the socks that march across the tongue while sleeping, you know morning mouth.
Well I have anytine mouth.
Just fall asleep and do not know it.
Mly brain is stuck so have to say later.

I believe that we have covered this topic before, but I feel too many people still do not get it, understand it or want to accept it.
There comes a time in dementia when we the recipients of this wonderful gift reach a point of leaving our current reality.
I call it crossing that line.
I hope that i personally am gone by that time or have enough for thought or feeling to leave before it comes.
You see many still do not understand the time between Early Onset Alzheimer's( like the medical profession even has the slightest idea when that reall happens) and Later Onset or the End Stages.
Those are all that are covered in the media or what people think of when they hear ALZHEIMER'S strikes again.
I cannot tell you how many have written me emails and called me and personally met with me and said, mom, dad, wife, husband, etc., hell they were fine even after the diagnosis for a number of years and fine this day and the next were all fucked up and knew nobody or anything around them.
Yes it happens that fast in many a case.
A fellow co-worker of my wife, mother or mother-in-law, just took that journey and he asked Lynn if it does really happen that fast.
Of course her answer was YES it does.
She was doing well the one day and the next well Alzheimer's said now you are completely mine and took over and the lady is headed for a nursing home.
You see we can go to sleep tonight doing ok, wake up tomorrow in a different world.
Hell it can happen just from a nap, or walking out of the kitchen into the dinning room.
Snap the other reality takes over.
I wrote an article called Caught Between Realities that is posted somewhere on my blog.
That tries to explain what it is like living between the beginning and end stages.
Here is where my family finds out where I am at.
I hide as much as I can from them.
I do not think it is out of denial, hell I know I have it, but more so that they do not have to carry any of the burden, but it is getting harder by the day to do so.
See in the in between stages we feel basically somewhat ok and I must confess at times think the tests and doctors are nuts and I am ok, but it does not take long for AD to let me know who is really running the show.
It is not me.
See the outside appears ok to others, the old saying Do Not Judge A Book By It's Cover, well that is me and many like me.
See the cover is ok, but open it and the pages are bent at the corners, toren, crinckled, highlighted so much that you cannot read them.
Many are missing so the story does not mat sense Thoughts and words line up to be written, but the pen goes dry and your are not able to get them out.
Do not feel bad even those in groups I have been invollved with do not understand this phase very well.
They seem not to grasp the fact that they are not ok and cannot do anything they want, you see we live with a disease, set of symptoms, condition, syndrome, whatever you want to call it that is a great deciever and painsts things so that they look ok.
But it is nothing but sound stage decoration.
I was reading an article the other day that just pissed me off.
It was about Glenn Campbell's Valiant fight against his Alzheimer's.
What the hell about Mary, Sue in Canada, Jan in Oklahoma, John in Iowa and the list goes on.
Do you think these folks are any less important, I sure the Hell Don't.
We just are not rich and famous so the press thinks.
Had to get that out we Count damn it!!!!!!
Stay well and be kind to yourselves.
God Bless & Keep You & This Country of Ours!

Joseph - Researchers have discovered a  first-of-its-kind blood test for Alzheimer's disease that can predict - with 90  percent accuracy - if a healthy person will develop this cruel disease within  three years.
Dr. Howard Federoff, the Executive Vice  President for Health Sciences and Executive Dean of Georgetown University School  of Medicine, led the team and will brief us in our next Alzheimer's  Talks conversation on May 16 on why his biomarker study is a potential  game-changer.
The possibility of catching the disease  before a patient ever shows symptoms brings us even closer to finding effective  means of prevention.
A blood test will enable us to identify people who will get  Alzheimer's disease and give them a drug to prevent symptoms.
That's why Dr.  Federoff's work is so essential to moving toward our 2020 goal.
I hope you can join me to be briefed by Dr.  Federoff about his preliminary - but potentially consequential - findings and  what they could mean to our mission to stop this disease.
Click the  button below to register for our call on Friday, May 16, from 1 p.m. - 2 p.m.
ET.
This call is made possible by the generous  support of the Zickler Family Foundation.
I hope to talk with you soon, and  thanks for being a part of our mission to end Alzheimer's by 2020.
Sincerely, George P.S.
Please note that everyone who registers  will be called on Friday, May 16 around 1:00 p.m.
ET and will be connected  automatically to the free  teleconference.
More than 400 leading Alzheimer's  researchers agree that we can prevent and effectively treat Alzheimer's by 2025  - and it could even be sooner if critical investments and reforms are made.
We  must SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASE funding for Alzheimer's research in the next 5 years  and we must DRAMATICALLY SHRINK the time it takes to get new, safe therapies to  market.

Since this is my last posting to Google, I thought I would let you know not all is bad in this world of mine.
This weekend we had a party to celebrate the birthdays of our son-in-law, oldest granddaughter and third Oldest grandson.
Along with the first anniversary of my son and his wife.
It was a good time, we had a baked Ham that I cooked, corn on the cob, watermeleon, catalope, strawberries, pineapple and rolls.
We had individual cakes for each, so they would feel special.
For some reason I just got wound up and was A bit nuts.
The grandkids spent the night.
All in all a good day for once.
I will still be posting on my blog.
Did want to say farwell to all on Google, be good to yourselves.

well well well well well well, a very deep subject for a shallow mind.
that is where I am at present.
I feel like one in the eye of the storm.
Things are calm, but you can feel little bits and pieces being pulled away from you, and that sometime, who knows when the damn thing is going to start raining all over you.
I answer questions wrong, because I hear them different then as they were asked.
I try to hide the problems still, but those walls and pathways are starting to crumble.
Mostly physically I am well, it is just my brain that is starting not to function on a steady plane.
Maybe it never did.
The normal span for this disease is 2-10 years from diagnosis.
YES there are people who live longer, but they are a special minority of us.
Sorry brain is trying to think.
I am glad to see and hea that many more of us thatsufer with dementia are coming out of the woodwork and banding together to tell the reality of it all.
I just hope that they do not fall victims to the oh you have to be proper and nice dead ass group out there.
This is not a friendly disease and should not be handled as such, that is my story and I am sticking to it.
I do not belong or am I ative in any groups, do not fit well never have, I am not a politically correct person and have no plans on becoming one.
In my opinion and thought processes they do not have the balls to be honest to the point of pain.
Truth real truth can be very hurting but it never changes and it always serves that which is right.
As many of you know I left twitter, facebook and a number of other social media sites, to much to deal with.
Well I will be closing down my google+ account and pages, and leaving the groups I belong to, it also is a strain to make sure things get posted right.
I want to say thank you to all of you that have taken the time to follow me, put me in your circles and and become part of mine.
I am going back to my roots so to speak that is My Blog Only I was born here and I belong here.
Hope you will visit and listen to my rantings and find useful information on the site as well.
Till next time take care of yourselves.

Hello to you all.
I have not been well the last week and half, both physically and mentally.
The wife and I just got back from a trip to Petaluma, CA visiting our daughter, son-in-law and our four grandchildren.
It was our eldest grandsons' birthday that we went up for.
Had a pleasant time except for handling all the energy those kids make, just too much for this one to handle.
Glad to be home and get back into my life routine, so I know shomewhat of what I am doing.
I am having more problems with my balance especially as the day wears on.
I also just drop off to sleep without knowing it, unless I am told.
This life is no longer pleasant or a lot of fun.
No matter how I try I just cannot get back.
I guess that is just the way this goes.
I do not know what more to say.
Till next time stay safe and take care of yourselves.
God Bless & Keep You & This Country of Ours!

Study Finds Fivefold Increase In Alzheimer's Deaths: Why It Matters | CommonHealth:  'via Blog this' I do not know how many of you have read or heard this report.
But it confirms what this blog has been saying for over 7 years.
Those who write me also have felt much the same.
Reasearch, medical practice, etc., what a joke.
in onver 113 years you still are looking at the same possible cause, use the same stupid tests, have no meds, really I do not think you even understand what you are dealing with.
Why?
Because you do not talk to us, you are tooooooo almighty and know crap.

Well today is Monday that is what my calendar says or shows whatever.
For those of you who have told me the auto music is a pain in the butt, just go to the right hand side of the blog under the welcome message and press the pause button on what looks like a radio.
If you go to any of the side movies ot that you may want to pause it.
My spelling is not getting better it seems they have put a correcto type thing in here now.
Give me a chance and I will beat it.
Well it seems the old thyroid is not what it once once was, I now have med.
for that also.
Lucky me.
I keep telling you folks by pharmaceuticals as long as I am here there is money to be made.
Would like to tell you what I did last week, but well I do not know, but I did things.
Got up, took pills, ate took several long naps I am sure, exciting is it not.
I read about the mental exercises that us folk are to do to help our brains so they do not go quietly into the night.
But I have problems with them so this is what I do.
Create situations in my one brain cell and then see how they play out.
Yes I control both sides of the coin.
I find it more stimulating, at least for me.
I think I probably have always done that.
I least I get the outcomes correct.
Find myself more and more drawing inside myself.
That may be in part the disease and part my way of handling things, not sure on that though.
Well not sure whatelse to say to TTFN.
God Bless & Keep You & This Country of Ours!

I have spent the last several hours checking th linsk that I have and changing them to there new location or deleting.
For me this is a massive project.
I keep closing my browsers, yes using two to make the changes.
One was even worse.
I have left comments om sp,e as I read them, something I have been bad about.
I pout when no one leaves me a comment, I guess I have no room to talk anymore.
To many of you all of this is no big deal, to me it is.
Because it takes me so fricken long to get started and I wind up getting so angry that I just stop.
That really helps I loose my changes and only have to try and remember what I was doing.
Yes I write notes, but they sort of get written over one another and it is difficult fore me to make them out.. but one has to keep trying.
My brain hurts more and more these days and I sure am not sure of what I am doing.
It is late in the day and I am getting very frustrated  with things.
So good bye for now.
Take care of yourselves.
God Bless & Keep You and This Country of Ours!

See I know what day today is, that is because I just finished doing my towels, which is my Friday task.
a little later I will have forgotten the day, but who cares they are all the same.
I have been reading some new study info, but most of it is unbased as yet and I do not want to pass it on.
Those of you who have followed me on Twitter and Facebook should know by now I have shut down my sites.
I think have have closed all but google+ and some of that I will not be posting to.
This is my home this is where we have come to know one another, this is where I shall be.
This disease, whatever you want to call it Alzheimer's, dementia, etc.
etc.
is a bitch to deal with.
I think I may have been able to stay clearer than a lot of those I know, this is my opinion, but I stopped along time ago taking those so called slow the progression drugs down.
I do take supplements for men, vitamin d3, probiotics and an assortment of prescription drugs for mood and to keep me from causing earthquakes with my shaking.
I had the eye surgery, right well now I have eye drops because I have dry eyes.
My vision is a lot like my brain sometimes clear and then fuzzy wonderful that I did this.
I need reading glasses which I have from the store, so I can see this and the mail.
I must say that I honestly regret having the surgery.
Eventually I would have gone blind, but this bullshit with my eyes is the same as with my brain a true pain in the ass.
I am really starting to hear folks say other words than what they are.
Conversations are getting worse and my loosing my bearings is becoming more common.
Names are really starting to escape me, who knows maybe that is all good.
What the hell I am nutty as a fruit cake anyways.
It is funny when I quit drinking decades ago, most of my so called friends disappeared.
Now that I am leaving the Social Media spot light, the same thing is happening.
But getting older a number have moved on.
Well till next time I get here, be good to yourselves.

It has been a little while since I last posted.
I have started to remove myself from several services that I have used.
I am getting to confused with everything.
I got rid of my twitter account, some additional blog sites.
I will be getting rid of all 4 I think it is of my faecebook pages.
Also that I think will remove me from the faceboook groups.
I will no longer be posting publicly on google+ after this post.
I will more than likely remove my self from some circles and groups as well.
I felt that I could handle all of this but I was wrong.
My blog is my passion and it is where you will find me.
That is as long as I remember to come here and post.
See I do come here and just sign out, confussion sets in more quickly these days.
I have to post when I remember, well at least when my brain and I are together.
I will share with you that my wife, with my full acceptance, has executed my power of attorney which I signed.
What a relief that is to me.
It is a loss of much freedom, but it has given me a better freedom, of not having to try and keep things correct which has become a huge problem.
I have spent funds and do not even remember doing it or why.
I guess Mr. A is catching up with me and taking his pound of brain cells.
I hope to bring you study results on dementia as I find them.
Remember this blog is about me, but I welcome all that suffer with dementia and what to share your stories as well.
I want to share with those who read our blog about the different forms of dementia, the truths not the hype and crap and so called treatments, which do exist to an extent.
Bear with me as I try to reshift my focus back to my blog and not get involved in other things.

So I am told the year has ended, well now that is all fine and dandy I guess, but when did it ever start.
I have no memory of the years before ending.
I am still working on June of 2010 I think.
I see what the calendar says but my brain does not quite follow it.
It is like not having to wear glasses now, my eyes say you can see stupid, my brain says where are your glasses?
What is really a pain is looking for my glasses that I do not need.
I still need readers but that is ok.
I am wearing at times a pair of glasses with no lenses, my wifes' idea and it seems to be helping me adjust.
Well Happy New Years to all.
now i got that out of the way.
It actually is starting to hurt writing posts, my brain does not want to cooperate with me, after all these years of giving it a place to live, that is gratitude for you.
Things that I have done, i am starting to no longer do.
My one job in the house is to do towels on Fridays, well now it seems Friday just is not in my week anylonger, I need to be reminded of my job now.
Just cannot get good help anymore.
I really dislike these days when I can think and then they go away and I get days that are just a mess.
I am no longer in control of my life, if I ever was, and that just is not acceptable but I cannot do anything about it.Oh well another day another brain cell or two gone.
Take care of yourselves.

This is from Alzheimer's/Dementia Weekly 7 Stages of Alzheimer's The seven stages of Alzheimer's are helpful in finding the words to discuss Alzheimer's.
Caregivers find them particularly useful in support groups, as well as in conversations with doctors and other professionals.Although the progression of Alzheimer's disease can be slowed down today thanks to today's medications, it cannot as of yet be stopped.
The process is described in general terms as going through 3 steps: Mild Alzheimer's Moderate Alzheimer's Severe Alzheimer's.
For more meaningful terms between professionals, caregivers and patients, a more detailed process has been characterized in seven stages.
The seven stages are based on a system developed by Barry Reisberg, M.D., clinical director of the New York University School of Medicine's Silberstein Aging and Dementia Research Center.
STAGE 1 - NORMAL This system calls a mentally healthy person at any age "Stage 1".
No memory problems No problems with orientation person - your name, who you are; place - what country, state, city you live in, where you are; time - what day, date, season it is No problems with judgment No difficulties with communication skills No problems with daily activities STAGE 2 - NORMAL AGED FORGETFULNESS More than half of all people ages 65 and older complain of cognitive difficulties.
This is considered a normal part of aging.
Occasional lapses in memory, usually undetectable to family and friends Slight cognitive problems, also undetectable to friends and family, might also not be visible on medical exam STAGE 3 - MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT At this point, there are mild changes in memory, communication skills and/or behavior, noticeable to family members and friends.
Symptoms might be picked up by an alert physician.
Many people will not decline further than this point.
Notwithstanding, a majority do progress to Mild Alzheimer's within two to four years.
Problems remembering names, words for objects Difficulties functioning at work and in social settings Problems remembering newly-read material Misplacing important items with increasing frequency Decline in organizational skills and the ability to plan Repeating questions and evident anxiety STAGE 4 - MILD ALZHEIMER'S Cognitive symptoms are more obvious now.
A neurologist can confidently diagnose Alzheimer's disease and treat it with medications that have been proven effective in slowing it down.
Difficulty remembering personal details, recent events Some confusion possible (ie: might put towel in fridge) Impaired mathematical ability, financial management (trouble managing a checkbook - for those who did not have trouble managing one before) Social withdrawal Moodiness, depression STAGE 5 - MODERATE ALZHEIMER'S This is the stage at which it is not possible for a person with Alzheimer's to live alone.
Severe memory loss, e.g., may not remember basic personal contact information such as current address or phone number Disorientation (not knowing the day/date/season, and/or location/country/state/city) No longer safe to cook, even if the sufferer can manage or remember the logistics of the process, due to severe short-term memory difficulties and confusion Wandering risk; might get lost once leaving the home Decreased personal hygiene skills Increased desire to sleep is common STAGE 6 - MODERATELY SEVERE ALZHEIMER'S It is at this stage that family members often suffer the most, because the loved one with Alzheimer's loses much of the ability to recognize those around him or her, even a spouse, sibling, parent or child.
Personality changes are common as well.
Severe memory loss continues to intensify Withdrawal from surroundings Wandering Reduced awareness of recent events Problems recognizing loved ones, although it is still possible to differentiate between those who are familiar and those who are not "Sundowning", if it has not yet begun, makes its appearance at this point - this is the phenomenon of increased restlessness and agitation toward sundown (hence the name), in the late afternoon and evening hours Bathroom management becomes difficult; at this stage it often is necessary to switch to diapers due to incontinence, wetting and other such problems using the bathroom independently Paranoia, suspiciousness Shadowing, extreme anxiety, following a loved one around the house due to fears of being alone Repetitive, compulsive behavior (verbal and/or nonverbal) STAGE 7 - SEVERE ALZHEIMER'S This is the final stage of Alzheimer's disease, at which the long goodbye comes to an end.
Even though the Alzheimer's person may somewhere inside really hear and understand what is being said, he or she can no longer respond, other than possibly to speak a word or phrase.
Communication is very limited Physical systems begin to deteriorate Gross motor coordination shuts down, may not be able to sit Swallowing may become difficult, choking is a risk The last stage of Alzheimer's disease, as with any other illness, is a very individual matter and no two journeys end the same way.
People with Alzheimer's seem to experience little physical pain.
What is certain, however, is that every Alzheimer's journey ends - as does every other.
May they all be peaceful and pain free.

Not sure if I told you all that I was going through eye surgery this month.
Well both eyes have been poked, sliced and diced and I can see again.
Having a real problem with that though.
I keep checking my face for my glasses and there are none, so I start to look for them.
Then that brain cell I have left says, stupid you dont need them anymore.
Reallly strange.
Been wearing them since I was 12.
Now at 69 I only need them to read.
And I can use those store bought reading glasses for that.
This is a huge change for me and my brain along with me are having problems with it.
Colors are now different in their shade and tone to me.
See I knew I lived in a different world, now I am wondering what this one is going to hold.
I still have most of the same old problems because of this disease.
I have a set job on fridyas and that is to do the towesl.
Well a bit of a problem with that.
I get up go downstairs and the towels remain where they were.
Of course I get reminded and say shit and go do my job.
My verbal communications are starting to get a bit garbled and not really clear, even to me and that is a problem.
I still try to let you all know what it is like here in Joeland, but i forget to often to post.
You and your comments are what keep me here, without them I probably would not continue this.
7+yrs of this has woren on me and my brain.
I am so smart that Monday I had oral surgery when I was going to have eye surgery on Tuesday.
By wednesday I felt beat up, battered, brused, malnourished and just plain lousy .
I am thinking that having both back to back was not good planning, oh well so goes my thinking.
I still set my meds up in a certain way and now that is not working, I have to look at each one to make sure and put them back and it just burns my buns.
I get to the point of just saying the hell with them.
Now I have eye drops to add which is fun, but they end in couple of weeks.
Enough of me and my mindless ness.
FROM MY FAMILY TO YOU AND YOURS A VERY MERRY CHRISTMAS AND A HAPPY NEW YEAR (just in case I forget)!
God Bless & Keep You & This Country of Ours!!!!!

Have no idea what the title means.
Just sounded good.
Have been dealing with some brain issues, now be nice I have 1/2 brain cell left.
I been getting very confused lately and not sure where my head is at.
More and more things are leaving my memory and even this morning seems kind of lost.
Am getting my eyes fixed, they are putting in permanent contacts so I can see.
Glasses do not work, one eye done and is working fine, so I have one lense in my glasses and one lens out.
two weeks for the ohter eye and then we will see what we see.Kind of crazy glasses since I was 12 and now that I have dementia and am 69 yrs old, am getting mly eyes fixed.
I guess i will be albe to see more clearly the things I can no longer do, wow what a rush.
I am doing less these days on this beast just because I forget about it.Then I say to myself lets get your ass in gear, I do I walk away and do something else, i don't understand I guess I am not suppose to.
But I am still here and still have somethings to say, just canot get them from my brain to mly fingers to the keyboard, let alone to remember to sign into my blog to post.
My days are shorter that is because I fall asleep several tiems during the day.
Well until the next time, oh right forgot hope you all had a great Thanksgiving, I think I did.
Christmas comming up that should be fun.
Take care.
God Bless & Keep You & This Country of Ours!

On Wednesday, November 13, 2013 the Banner Alzheimer's Institute hosted a webinar in conjunction with the Alzheimer'sPrevention Registry.
Jessica Langbaum, principal scientist and Asst.
Dir.
- Alzheimer's Prevention Initiative was the presenter of the webinar.
She outlined her background about her grandfather which motivated her into the field of prevention rather than cure basically.
He had been and engineer with Honeywell and died for AD.
Jessica recalled the pains that most caregivers and loved ones go through when attending to an individual with Alzheimer's.
She explained what we already know about the disease that it is not a normal part of aging; it is incurable and devastating to all involved.
Her primary focus however was on the Alzheimer's Prevention Registry, of which I am a member.
The registry has three main missions: 1.)
Keep up-to-date with the latest news on preventative studies.
2.)
Help to fill research studies into the prevention of Alzheimer's.
3.)
Keep easy and understandable news resources concerning trials.
The APR is not setup for clinical studies into the causes or cures of different dementias but for the purpose of having on hand a list of those willing to enter studies concerning the prevention of the disease.
They hope to have 100,000 members by the end of this year.
The Registry was started in 5/2012 and as of this morning 11/26/2013 hat 23,475 members; as you can see they have a very ambitious goal and need your support.
They are expecting two national studies to start in 2014.
You can hear the webinar by clicking on this link and the question and answer session that followed.
You can visit here to learn more about the Alzheimer's Prevention Initiative.
I encourage you that are not showing signs of the disease and are otherwise healthy to join the Alzheimer'sPrevention Registry to help in anyway that you can to confront the battle of this disease on a different front.
I feel you can learn more from listening to the webinar then my continued writing, you will be here for the next year reading.
So to all that follow my blog, GET INVOLVED.
God Bless & Keep You & This Country of Ours!

I got the following from a friend, where it is from I do not Know.
I like this--answers my  fears!!!!!!!
Ever walk into a room with some  purpose in mind, only to completely forget what that  purpose was ?
Turns out, doors themselves are to blame  for these strange memory lapses.
Psychologists at the University of  Notre Dame have discovered that  passing through a doorway triggers what's  known as an Event Boundary in the mind, separating  one set of thoughts and memories from  the next.
Your brain files away the  thoughts you had in the previous room and  prepares a blank slate for the new locale.
Thank goodness for studies like  this.
It's not our age, it's that darn door!
Did I send this to you  already?--  Here I thought I had dementia and all the time it is just those damn doors opening and closing.
God Bless & Keep You & This Country of Ours!

Friends, Followers & Family Leading researchers believe we can stop  Alzheimer's by 2025 if sufficient funding is allocated to Alzheimer's  research.
Congress is hammering out the  details of the 2014 budget right now and we  must convince them to prioritize biomedical research funding before it is too  late.
The deep budget cuts - known as  "sequestration" - that went into effect earlier this year are slowing efforts to  find the cause of Alzheimer's and to develop effective treatments and therapies  to slow, modify, stop, and eventually prevent it.
The NIH's 2013 budget has already  been cut by $1.55 billion and, unless we can convince Congress to  change course now, even more drastic cuts will be made in 2014 that will mean  fewer research grants and delayed progress in medical  breakthroughs.1 Some researchers are being forced to  take out personal loans to keep their labs open - a practice that is  clearly unsustainable.2 The budget cuts also mean that fewer  research scientists are being trained - we've already lost one out of  every ten MD-PhD training slots due to sequestration.3 Congress will be trying to reach an  agreement on the budget in the next two to three weeks.
This blueprint would set  spending levels, and without adequate room for biomedical research and other  programs, increased funding for Alzheimer's research will be  unlikely.
You and I both know that the squeaky wheel  gets the grease.
Raising  your voice now will help ensure that our call for  Alzheimer's research funding can be heard in the halls of Congress.
Ask  your members of Congress to reverse the devastating cuts and invest more in  biomedical research in the budget they're creating right  now.
Thank you again for raising your voice to  stop this devastating disease from claiming more lives and destroying more  families.

A unique smartphone/tablet App called It's Done!
is helping early- stage Alzheimer's sufferers remember whether they turned off  the stove, locked the door, or took their medication.
For those  dealing with dementia and short term memory loss, the app  instantly confirms the completion of everyday routine tasks.
The  app can even notify loved ones and caregivers that a task has  been done.
People with Alzheimer's who use a smartphone or  tablet have found the It's Done!
app offers new hope for  improving their quality of life.
It's Done!
has received strong reviews from users coping with  memory loss.
One user wrote: "I cannot tell you how long I have  been looking for an application just like this one.
I have seen it in  my mind many times and now it's a reality..." Another wrote:  "Very cool.
It is great for daily use, especially remembering those  small details."  With the It's Done!
app, users simply check-mark "Done" their  routine everyday tasks (lock the door, turn off the stove, etc.).
Later, when the uneasy thought occurs, "Did I remember to...?",  It's Done!
confirms whether the task is done.
The need to re- check, second-guess, or worry is eliminated.
A potentially life-saving feature of the It's Done!
app is its ability to automatically generate a text  message or email to notify others when a task is done.
So within seconds of taking a daily medication  and check-marking It's Done!, a loved one or caregiver immediately receives a text or email confirming  it.
While helping the user recall the completed task, It's Done!
also assures others, reducing their need  to call or worry.
The It's Done!
app is designed with an intuitive interface that aids the memory process.
Tasks first  appear with an empty check-box and message "Task Awaiting Completion".
When a task is check- marked done, a bright green check-mark appears with a "click"sound and phone vibration.
These visual,  audible, and tactile cues reinforce confirmation of each completed task.
A timestamp automatically  confirms when a task is done.
Tasks performed multiple times in a day can be checked, unchecked, and  checked again, with a new time stamp each time the task is completed.
The app tracks the number of  times a task is done and all completed tasks are stored in the app's history for review at any time.
It's Done!
also has a task reminder alert that notifies users at the appointed time, helpful for prescribed  medication times, important phone calls, and other time-specific tasks.
It's Done!
is available for iPhone/iPad at the iTunes AppStore and for Android devices at Google Play.
It's  also available for Kindle devices at Amazon.
The It's Done!
website provides detailed information about the app, User Guide videos, FAQ, and  Customer Support.
The creator of the It's Done!
app, Howard A.J.
Lester, points to the vital public service the app provides.
"Everyone forgets whether they did something every now and then," Lester said, "and, for those people,                                                                                                  It's Done Website It's Done!
is a fun and handy app for confirming stuff is done.
But, for folks with memory loss due to  Alzheimer's, brain injury, or other medical conditions, this simple, yet vital, app can certainly improve  their quality of life."       And for their loved ones and care-givers?
Lester says, "We believe It's Done!
can create real peace of  mind for the caregivers and loved ones of those who suffer from short-term memory loss...just one  more tool for helping everyone rest easy."  ###   Contact:  Howard "A.J."

The last several weeks have been rough mentally and emotionally.
As you know I and others have just finished up To Whom I May Concern - Our Side Of The Fence.
This took a great deal out of all of us trying to get down what we wanted to say.
We all became closer during the sessions and found it easier to talk to one another and actually be who we are now.
I Can tell you this it was difficult at times for me to keep my mouth shut and row with it as they say.
Every time Jan said: "You don't want to scare the Joe."
I wanted to yell out the hell I don't.
I want them to know the pain and missery we suffer.
They think they know but they do not.
But the group kept me under control, not an easy task.
I can tell you hear how I feel in the language I choose to use, like it or not.
This is not a pretty world that those of us who suffer live in and die in.
It russels my bussel when people say well you are living with alzheimer's and must find the good in it, and live it.
Well those asses are not in this world YET.
Yes I live with it, but the hell of finding words, trying to remember what I was doing or going to do keeps getting worse.Trying to help people understand,l the anger, frustration, fear and the out right terror that comes with this is not easy.
It takes me getting really angry nowadays to come here to talk to you.
But you are my family and you need to know what you very well may face someday sooner or later.
I learned from a program how to live one day at a time.
I now envy those that can do that.
See my day only consists of now.
I have no fricken idea where my mind or I will be even one hour from now, that is pretty darn scarey and makes me angry.
It is hard for those around me to understand that and that pisses me off.
I hope you all go to the link in my last post and watch the video and the question and answer session that followed.
Hopefully it will give you more insight and understanding.
God Bless & Keep You & This Country of Ours!

Link  to Our Side of the Fence videoand recording of Talk Back  Session   For those of you  unable to attend today's webinar presentation of the new To Whom I May  Concern(r) video,  Our Side of the  Fence, or who want to watch it again, go to the  Recordings  page on the A Meeting of the Minds  website.
Here is the link: http://minds-meeting.com/recordings-slides-from-previous-webinars/ On this page you  will also find the recording of the Talk Back Session that  took place between webinar participants and the four performers, along with  Maureen, Richard, and Laura.
I think you'll find the conversation enriching and  enlightening.
There is also a link to the To Whom I May Concern website  and blogs of some of the performers.To Whom I May  Concern is an interactive  theatre project involving people with dementia as partners in creating the  script and as performers of the play.
The resulting play script, whether  presented in a live setting or online via video, becomes an educational  opportunity to raise awareness and start a conversation about  dementia.
In  Our Side of the  Fence, you are invited to join a group of people  diagnosed with dementia on their side of the "fence" -- the fence that divides  them from the rest of society because of their diagnosis.
While there, you will  learn firsthand what it is like to live with the symptoms of dementia, and what  the view of the world is like from "our side of the fence."
At the end, you will  be able to walk out the gate back to your side, but the hope is that you will  carry with you the experience of those who can't leave.
For all of you who could not attend the presentation and the live question and answer session that followed the link is in this post.
Hope you enjoy as much as I enjoyed being a part of this.

Dear Joseph,Thank you for  your continued efforts to help us end Alzheimer's disease by being a valued  member of the Alzheimer's Prevention Registry.Today, we made another  great step in the fight against Alzheimer's disease.
Our organization, Banner  Alzheimer's Institute, was honored to receive a $33.2M grant from the National  Institutes of Health (NIH) to conduct a major prevention trial.
This study, when  launched, will evaluate a treatment for this disease in healthy adults, age  60-75, with the highest known genetic risk for developing Alzheimer's in later  life.
It is the largest federal grant to date to test a drug specifically  designed to prevent Alzheimer's in people without symptoms.We are now  looking at potential treatments to prevent both the early and late onset forms  of the disease.
This kind of comprehensive approach could prove to be the  tipping point in our long, arduous effort to find a way to end this devastating  disease.Enrollment in the Registry  is critically important since this study will draw participants from our  members.
We encourage you to share this exciting news with family and friends so  they too can be part of our fight to end Alzheimer's and save precious  memories.
A copy of the official announcement can be found on our website, endALZnow.org/news.Sincerely,Jessica  Langbaum, PhDAssociate DirectorAlzheimer's Prevention  Initiative Thank you for taking action  against Alzheimer's by joining the Registry.
The memories you save could be your  own...

Hi Joe, I lost my grandmother to AD in 2005.
To say she was like a  mother to me, does not do her impact on my life justice.
In the end, she no  longer remembered who I was.
This was beyond painful and I still weep today  over this suffering today.
Your song, "You Raise Me Up" on the home page, was  played at her funeral.
How do you think, believe, after you pass on, is your memory  is restored?
I can live with her not remembering me in this life.
I can't  accept that she won't in the afterlife.
Maybe this is a blog you could add to  your site, I'm sure others are thinking the same thing.
Bless you and your family, (name withheld) ________________________________________________________________________________ I received the above email almost a week ago and have been thinking (i know), about what to write.
Well here it goes, it may be blunt but I what to tell it as it is with me, not what you may want to here.
First I do not grieve over those past, but try to rejoice in the time I had with them.
Grieving to me is selfish.
I say get over yourself, this life is for the living not those past on.
Besides your grandmother is free from this damn disease, be happy for her and yourself.
Let the stench of it leave, it hung around to long before and now to long since.You are not alone eventually those of us who suffer with AD FORGET people, as we move forward in our lives.
You see AD takes who we are first, then it takes us physicallly, but when you boil it all down, we win because we are set free.
Having not reached the otherside yet, shit, I cannot really answer your question.
I think we would remember those left behind, because we are free of the disease, but the happiness that we would feel with our freedom I feel would put that behind us.
I think you should also and be happy.
Hope this helps.
God Bless & Keep You & This Country of Ours!!!!

Living With Alzheimer's Meet Joe.
Both inspirational and incisive his Living With  Alzheimer's blog is making waves.
As funny and frank as it gets,  his wit and laid-back approach to life somehow make it easier to grapple with  the challenges that dementia brings.
Joe makes the battle less painful--and certainly less isolating--by adding  humor and casual grace into the mix.
Stop by to give Joe some virtual applause  for leading the way to a future of dignity, perseverance, and hope for everyone  with dementia.
This is because of all of you as well that read and follow my blog.

GREEN KITTY By: Alexandra Faer Bryan I was asked to read and write a review of this book.
This is not easy for me, but here it is.
Green Kitty is a story of a grandchild (female) visiting a grandmother who has been placed in assisted living in the early stages of her illness.
The grandmother is suffering the onset or one could say already in the beginning grips of Alzheimer's.
The girl goes weekly to visit her grandmother with her aunt and sometimes with her father.
They seem to make a point of going the same day each week.
While it is not directly stated, in doing this they are giving grandma something to look forward to on a certain day each week.
This gives the elderly lady a sense of normalcy, whether the family really realizes it or not.
See, we with Alzheimer's, or any form of dementia, exist in a realm of non changing things around us.
Change can bring great confusion, anxiety and sometime rage.
On her visits the grandmother tells the young girl stories from her past as she remembers them.
Stories about the dogs they had, her father and has promised to tell her about the Green Kitty.
But the elderly woman tells the girl she can not remember the story but as soon as she does she will tell her.
You will have to read the book to get the story; I do not kiss and tell as they once said.
This is a very gently written story filled with fun and laughter.
However the young girl has been told of grandmother's condition and is very respectful of it.
When grandma repeats herself the girl in gentle and listens to her stories over again.
Although the book is written to help those from ages 8 to 12 to understand about a love one living with dementia, I feel it speaks to a greater audience.
It shows that we living in that world remember the past sometimes with great accuracy.
The grandmother does not speak of things in the present.
When I was in school they gave us the following grades S=superior, E=excellent, C=good, D=you in deep doo doo and F=you found the bottom of the well.
Based on that rating system, since I am older than dirt, I give this book a very solid S. Reviewed by: Joseph V. Potocny You can Green Kitty at the links below.

This morning both Lynn and I were co-hosts on a Care Connection call for the AFA.
We both want to thank them for the opportunity for allowing us to get our sides of the story of Living With Alzheimer's out there.
Both from a caregiver spouse's view and from the one with the disease.
I want you to know that I was very respectful and polite.
It burned my ass to be that way because of how I feel about being nice about this disease but a promise is a promise and it was kept.

I am still having a problem with cpap masks, they keep winding up in my mouth, even the large ones, i guess people have been right all this time I just have a big mouth.
I may be getting a larger a better KOI pond built, which is something I have wanted.
My monsters are just to big for their quarters.
It is eith a bigger pond or find someone to take them.We will see what is.
Well have a good day.

well it has only taken me what 2 weeks to write to you all again.
I have tried but i keep drawing blanks on what to say.
so this post maybe gibberish to most.
as some of you may know i am on google+, do not ask me why I have already tried to answer that one myself.
emails up the well a bunch every day.
today i did get the chance to talk to a gentleman from India on google was neat reaching out and touching someone.
my ability to follow and get involved in conversations is getting really bad.
I did do some actual work the other day, I yes me, did paint the bathroom downstairs by myself.
After many trips on step stool and ladder and what seemed like 110 hours, i finished, I was so wet from sweating that my clothes were stuck to me, see ladders, step stools and work and I do not actually live in the same world.
I think i lost 1/2 ton of wieght during the job.One of my jobs in the house is to do the towels every week on friday.
Hell it seems that every day is friday.
I no sooner do them and here I am having to do them again and wondering what happened to the week in between, always thoguht that there was 7 days between fridays, now there is only one night of sleep for me.
no more unplanned trips out of the bed, the bed rail works fine, i even sleep right next to it and even hug it.
the cpap is becomming a real pain, we have tried what seems like 3000 different masks and stuff and nothing fits right, I leak to much from the mask.
I now have facial leaks as well as bottom ones.
Tell you this is really getting to be a challenge.
I am spending a lot of time at my computer, not doing things just looking at it and wondering why and what i am doing or supposed to be doing.
It takes forever for me to gt thigs done or figure out what it is that I want to do and then forget it that quickly.
This is the only thing I can do with some degree of accuracy and that is write to you and tell you that this life sucks more and more each day.
I try to get involved like an activist but keep being told Joe people do not want to listen to you because you are to fricken blunt and challenge their pet projects or beliefs.
I should be more gentle, screw that when this fuckin disease becomes more gentle and nice maybe then so will I, but do not hold your breathe.
Well to all those nice gentle onew out there have fun.
This coming thursday the 8th I will be guest speaker (poor people) for the Alzheimer's Foundation of America, caregiver group as I understand, yes me believe it or not.
The call is at 10 AM PST, call in number is 1-877-594-8853 and the id to get into the call is 53181404# to listen and there will be a question and answer period, what fun that could be.
So if any of you can tune in try it you might like it or not.
God Bless & Keep You & This Country of Ours!

If not, you'll be shocked to learn that more than three times that is adult diapers.
That's right - 7 percent of all landfills or 17.5 million tons of garbage are adult diapers, making it the third largest consumer item in U.S. landfills.
With 30 million adult Americans living with urinary incontinence (including those with Alzheimer's) and landfills overflowing (one so large it can literally be seen from space), something needs to change!
Whether light, moderate or heavy incontinence, many people deal with these issues through disposable adult diapers.
Although sometimes labeled biodegradable, that can be a cryptic word without a clear meaning.
According to the California Integrated Waste Management Board, not even biodegradable diapers break down in a landfill.
It can take up to 500 years for a disposable diaper to decompose.
Not only that, but Natural-Environment.com found that more than 82,000 tons of plastic and 250,000 trees are used to make disposable diapers each year.
Enter Wearever.
Wearever offers an alternative that results in ZERO waste in a year compared to thousands of disposable diapers.
It's a line of men's and women's underwear that are washable and reusable, and feature an innovative absorbent pad.
They work just as well if not better than diapers for those living with urinary incontinence, but with the added benefits of better comfort (since they are made from cotton or similar fabrics rather than plastic), no embarrassment (since no one would know you are wearing them) and better for the environment.
Even better, they save the average wearer about $500 a year over the cost of disposables.
The average wearer sends approximately 1,100 to 1,500 diapers a year to landfills.
Multiplied by millions of wearers, that means billions of adult diapers each year.
It can't be disputed that adult diapers are bad for the environment.
Caregivers and those dealing with incontinence on a daily basis should be aware of the environmentally friendly options available to them.
Whenever possible, use washable, reusable options like Wearever that don't contribute to daily waste.
Next time you're picking out incontinence products, keep this post in mind.
Make sure you explore all options for dealing with incontinence.
About the author:   Mandy Harrell is the brand manager for Wearever.
Wearever offers comfortable, quality, affordable and stylish apparel solutions for everyday health and wellness concerns.
The men's and women's underwear line of washable, reusable urinary incontinence panties and briefs is especially beneficial for active individuals who want to continue their normal lifestyle without worry or emotional stress resulting from urinary incontinence.

# # # You all know I do not personally endorse products, however since I belong in this category, I decided to try the product.
My wife said no to the lace panties and that I was too old to play dress up anymore.
She is just no fun at times.
So fellows I tried the briefs and the boxers.
The briefs were fine.
I have to say the boxers were the best undergarments (see I am keeping it adult here) that I have ever worn bar none.
The do not ride up, give you a wedgey or any of those things.
They are soft and comfortable.
I did not even sweat in them like I normally do.
Yes I am going to by more.
Make up your own mine.
A little pricey up front but consider the number of times they can be washed they are very inexpensive.
No more depends, won't see me at the landfills anymore.
Happy, well you know.
God Bless, joe PS> you can tell i only wrote that after the ### marks.

I have been having some not so fun times in my head of late.
I have gotten involved with Google+ with about 40000 people.
The emails are crushing so I only read a few per page and do postings.
I got one where a person was having trouble with their loved one who has Alzheimer's and whether to tell them that the person they were asking for was dead.
The problem I have and maybe because I live with a different outlook and things do not mean the same, I answered tell the person, they will forget soon anyway no damage.
Then you see all these long replies filled with dripping sympathy and saying the same thing.
You that follow me know that i am one to be bllunt and tell it, do not beat around the bush.
But see everyone on the other side of the fence knows better.
They know how we feel, how we will react, what will make us sad, etc.
etc.
Really you know shit abbout our world.
Yes bad news bothrs us, but we forget it quickly.
What you do not understand is that Yesterday is so long ago and well Tomorrow who the hell knows anything about it we do not.
All we know for the most part as we advane in this disease, condition or syndrome whatever you want to call it, is the moment, understand the moment, not 25 minutes ago or about 9 pm that is not here yet.
You keep trying to pull us back into your world and cause confussion, frustration, anger, bitterness and give us a sense of being less than.
Leave us be, help when we ask or reallly need it.
Stay out of our faces, laugh with us do not treat us as if we are some creature from another realm.
We are PEOPLE, treat us as such, you do not need to incllude us in everything, it is too much.
The most important thing you can do for us is LISTEN to us and not tell us what we are saying, whether it is right or wrong to YOU, because it is RIGHT to us and that is all that matters.
You will see a film clip on the side bar, it is about, bibs for those of us who have holes in our chins when we eat.
I will be getting one, but as you know I do not push or sell for others, this is a resource for you to look at and see if it wil be useful.
The more i try to get less involved the more I seem to be suck into things.
Not in shady ways I have a smart wife for that and I can still smell the stink of things.
There is more in my head but it just will not come out.
The disconnect between my brain and means of telling it are breaking down more.
So for now till who knows when be good to yourselves.
God Bless & Keep You & This Country of Ours!

Howdy all, things as far as nightly adventures is flying have been quiet the new bed rail is keeping where i belong for the time being.I am now using a new CPAP for sleeping, not sure what it is doing except breathing on my face and is a pain taking on and off, especially when nature sings her lovely song ing tthe middle of the night without any delay.
You may have noticed or not that some things have been removed from my page.
I am starting to shutdown many of the sites and places where my blog appears, eventually down to just this place.
I will be shutting down my account with network blogs, feedburner, both pages on facebook, twitter, linkden, google+ and the others that i can remember.
I have two commitments that I have made that I need to keep and after them no more.
It is becomming difficult just to talk here.
I nolonger know what to say, except the days get lost more and more and I am never sure of what I am doing.
My schedule does not fit anybody elses in the house, I am up and asleep as my body says.
I have grwon very tired and angry at contacting folks all the time and they do not do the same.
I am beginning to know why those who suffer from Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia, withdraw from attempting to live in your world.
Frankly you all seem to busy and we are not worthy of your time.I have not decided to share the emails that i have had with a Mr. Herrera who is a regional VP for the Alzheimer's Association or not.
They demonstrate the level of compassion and real caring from such people.
Enough for me for now.
My baain wants to do other things rather than hwlp me here.
God Bless & Kepp You & This Country of Ours!

Remember that kids book: "Where in the World is Waldo"?
we still have a copy from when my kids were kids and now for the grandkids.
You know I still have the damndest time finding him even after 30+ years and who knows how many times of going over the book.
Well that is how I feel about me now, i do not hear words right anymore, mess up on the words i want to ses  get lost in conversations, forget what it is i want to do  or am too do.
Again a week ago the High Flying Potocny did it again and managed to launch himself in the middle of the night out of bed.
This time i landed between the nightstand and paper shredder flat on the old back.
Messed up my left upper arm, left thigh and bruised the hell out of my ribs on the right side.
Yes ENTER THE DREDDED BED RAIL.
wife is not going to have anymore of this.
knowing me I will just grab the top of the rail and go for a lond distance flight before crash landing.
I am even having a hard time answering emails, taking way to long, just outright forget to.
I am slowly shutting down some of the sites I use and post on, cannot keep up with it all.
This blog is becommming  dificult enough to deal with.
My will power and mental capacities are starting to loose the battle as I knew they would, but that still pisses me off.
Till we all meet again at Joe's Bar & Grill.
God Bless & Keep You & This Country of Ours!!!!

I attend a mens meeting on Monday nights and they are all aware that I have Alzheimer's.
We had sort of a celebration for one of our members.
In sharing one of the guys turns to me and says Joe you are a lot nicer since you got Alzheimer's.
I about feel out of chair, we could not stop laughing.
So see there is fun here in this world at times.
When you have friends that are not afraid to joke with you, especially since you do yourself.
But my sleeeeping habits are getting really bad.
I once again managed to through myself out of the bed.
I landed this time between the night stand and the paper shredder.
How I managed that feat is beyond me.
My body this time took a beating.
I have this really nice long round knot and bruise on on leg, one to match on my shoulder and my ribs took a beating to.
I think the other guy won this one.
I am starting to think that staying calm and keeping my mouth shut and not letting this condition completely control me is starting to take its toll a different way.
But I survived long enough for the wife to order a bed rail for my side.
We will see if that works, I hope so, I cannot take many more of these 2+ foot drops to the floor, they hurt and I am old.
Everyone stay well till the next time.
God Bless & Keep You & This Country of Ours!!!!

things seem to be getting more mixed up.
I sure am clumbseyer.
We bought a new bed, one of those memory foam jobs, well with the new foundation and the mattress, I have to climb and roll into it, to high to lift this ass of mine up.
So my darling wife bought me a two step stool (small but sturdy) it helps but I still have some problems.
Last night I unplug a razor on my night stand and turned around to get in bed.
WELL, MR. Acrobat here, took one step hit the step stool and planted my face directly on the mattress.
problem was the rest of me was hanging off the bed.
See there is fun having Alzheimer's, at times.
In just regular conversation I get all mixed up, use the wrong words, words sort of dribble out of my mouth and I forget in the middle of things what it is we are talking about.
What frustrates me the most is when involved in talking about one thing with people I can concentrate and articulate (there's a word for you) myself very well, but do not let me get distracted then I am lost.
I am starting to forget what I had for breakfast or llunch now, or if i have even had them.
It just bites my butt how fast one can forget something, that was said or took place 5 minutes or so before.
I will tell you this I personally am outraged at all this crap on the Internet and what I get in my email about The Lady that Reversed her Alzheimer's in 37 days, Or the new cure for Alzheimer's found by a nobel prize winner that has been surpressed and the other shit that puts everything back to what it was.
I say kiss off, if these things WERE true why is it then a new person every 70 seconds joins this World?
because these claims may help some and I say some for a short time but have no lasting affect, accept to wear off and leave the person right where they would have been anyway and now more confused because of it.
I am thinking about getting a wagon and a horse and start traveling this country town to town peddeling Dr. Joe's cure all oil, seems we have moved back to the Old West times.
Sorry folks it will not only be .10 cents, 1/10th of a dollar, but hay costs alot so it will be $19.95 a bottle, but wait if you buy when I say to, I will double the deal and give you two bottles of bull shit, no shipping and handeling, fresh made from the back of my wagon, now how can you beat that deal.
Now all you pervaders of new cures and reversal drugs and ways to stop this disease, send me your hate mail so I can send you a free bottle, hurry this offer maybe taken off the internet at anytime.
But make sure you press the orange button at the bottom to get your FREE 30 day supply.
Till next we meet, be good to yourselves.
God Bless & Keep You & This Country of Ours!

<doc date=Sunday, May 19, 2013>
I have been posting a number of articles of late and very little about my world.
I think that is because I have fallen into the trap of others of being shall we say pansy.
Well this disease is kicking my ass now and no more time to be gentle about it.
Screw the so calls that say we need high profile people to promote the cause.
Well does the Cancer Society= breast or otherwise, just use high profilce  people is there commercials frick NO.
They use real people.
Why is it that real people, the commoners of this society cannot be used to promote the fight.
And what is the fight that is being waged in the World of Dementia?
Is it a fight to find THE CAUSE, A cure or is it one to find away to make more money with meds and getting caregivers caught up in training and bullshit terminology.
People with Dementia is now becoming politically incorrect, it implies we are DEMENTED, well guess what asses we are and some of us in a violent way, lets get real.
Forget symantics let us move beyond that pettiness and communicate with us that have the disease.
Many of us will talk and tell you, if you just quit treating us like non persons and ask outright questions and show you are not afraid of us.
I have lost a number of friends even those that followed my blog because they no longer knew what to say or ask.
There in lies the greatest problem ASK the question.
Yes we have some meds that seem to slow the progression of the disease, but by no means stop it or cure it.
In fact when they stop working or one is taken off of them for various reasons, they seem to deteriorate rapidly to the end game and being freed.
I listen to the cries from our law makers and major associations that say how much they care and are doing.
Kiss my ass, that is the same crap I heard over 7 years ago when I started this blog, i said it then and now you need to talk to us we HOLD THE KEY.
I am not able to walk well at all anymore, my movement on the stairs is comiing close to Fred Astaire dancing up and down them.
My eyes are getting worse, my moods are getting harder to control, I am tired of fighting to stay level shal we say.
I keep quiet alot because i do not know what will come out of my mouth.
I am beginning to understand now why many just kind of sit and disappear.
It is much easier to deal with, but there is still some fight left in this old fart.
A View of The World From Mine!
God Bless & Keep You & This Country of Ours!

I posted about Richard Taylor being ill. Well yesterday i think it was i found out that he is out of the hospital, eating and getting better.
Have written Richard but not heard back again, i still wish him well.
Many of you know my friend Dr. Joe Sivak, he wrote "When Can I Come Home"; about his experieneces as a teenager taking care of his mother who had Alzheimer's and the shall we say discussions between him and older siblings.
Well I have be talking to Dr. Joe the last couple of days and my friend and friend to many of you is not doing well.
He has glacoma and worst of all magucular degeneration of the eyes.
Send your prayers and well wishes his way.
He may get pissed at me for saying something, but his blog has given much to others.
So if he gets mad i will just tell the sob that is the way it is, and we will continue to be friends.
My son got married last weekend to a very sweetheart of a lady.
She already tells me to be quiet and sit down.
It was nice, down at the marina in San Diego on the south lawn I think and then the reception in the Coral Room.
It was a very pleasant time.
But I need to tell you it has taken me almost all this time to recover from the stress, frustration and not knowing really what was happening for that week.
Once again our family descended upon us, love them all but have a hard time with 8 grandchildren, six adults in the house pllus part of bridal party, my brain cell can not hanndle it all.
I know poor me.
In August I will be on a national call for the Alzheimer's Foundation of America, with my story and answering questions to caregivers I guess.
I warned them about me, but God gives courage to those who need it and they still booked me.
I was on Lori Bay's dementia cares show last Tuesday, what kick.
Lori runs the Alzheimer's Speak, listing on the side of my blog.
I am so behind in emails and thanking people, my hair is falling out what there is of it anyway.
Until i remember what i want to say take care and be good to yourselves.

"Noticing that people with cancer tended not to get Alzheimer's disease, and vice versa, Florida researchers screened FDA approved anti-cancer drugs for their ability to reduce Alzheimer's plaque.
Learn how carmustine stands out, decreasing amyloid b levels by 75%."
This is the second report I have read on this drug.
Well if the reports are correct, good bye Aricept, Namenda, Excerol(or however you spell it), Coconut Oil, Tumeric, etc.
Of course the drug only retards the progression no cure, but that is a lot more than the rest really do.
I have read up on Vitamin D3 and Omega3.
I take 2000IU of D3 daily and maybe that is why I am not still not completely out to pasture.
Although things are getting more uncomfortable and I have the wrong words come out when I talk and forget what the heck I am saying.
Stairs are becoming a real problem for me and walking even worse.

                                        Caught Between Realities                                                 (By: j.v.
potocny) Come with me into my world of Alzheimer's, to help learn the joy, pain and peace that one can find.
By the way my name is Joe, yes simply Joe.
I am a sufferer of Alzheimer's (AD) and Frontal Temporal Dementia (FTD).
In other words my brain does not function like yours.
But that is ok, I live in a multiple of realities, unlike you I never know when I will pop in or out of any of them.
My life is kind of like Bugs Bunny having Elmer Fudd chasing after him.
I pop up in one place, than another and so on, until I find you.
However I cannot dig holes to go into I would wind up falling in them.
See this life presents many problems but one has to find the humor in it or just totally give up.
What you need to realize is that there is NO CURE, NO TREATMENT (OF VALUE) AND NO KNOWN CAUSE for these diseases.
Yes that is right Virginia, we all DIE from this disease.
Life expectancy is about 2 - 10 years from diagnosis, more or less.
Remember AD, FTD and other forms of dementia are not forms of MENTAL ILLNESS, they are DISEASES.
Our physical brains actually shrink and loose functionality.
It is my personal opinion that AD and other forms of dementia are auto immune diseases.
I base this on the fact that the body for whatever reason causes the formation of the protein strand that becomes part of the beta amyloid protein, the suspected culprit in this disease.
Just a little note these amyloids can cause heart attacks, kidney failure, liver problems, in other words can affect many organs throughout the body besides the brain.
We who suffer from this disease get to meet new people almost daily, even in our own households.
Kind of like an EMU, who turns around to look at the same person and sees a new person, a new friend.
We get to forget the past gradually, the good stuff to be sure, but also the pain caused by others in our lives and ourselves.
We get to forget all the nonsense we were taught.
The birds, clouds, trees and such all take on a new meaning in the world we are thrust into.
If you are reading this and saying to yourself, right this guy is ok, I want you to know that spell checker and grammar checker are wonderful.
See if I chose not to use them, as I do on my blog, you would need to learn how to Speak Alzheimer's.
My dialect is known as joeneese, yes all my own a mix of various words, utterances, looks and whatever else comes along.
Most people wonder how one handles getting this news.
Well let me tell you some go to pieces, some cry, some get angry, some wonder why me, etc.
Me I just said thanks now you have confirmed what I have thought for the past 10 years or so.
See I suffered from what I now call, DDSS or better known as Depressed Distracted Stress Syndrome.
I have found over the years since 2004 that many people with AD went through the same annoying diagnosis when they knew the doctor was off the beam so to speak if not outright crazy.
To be validated was a relief to me not a blow to my life.
Actually being given this death sentence relieved me of some fears of death.
See I never feared dying but I did fear death from a heart attack or that Nano second between life and death as we call it.
But suddenly that no longer bothered me it just went the way of a wind storm puff.
I am not a religious person, so let us get that out of the way, but I do believe in one God and Jesus Christ.
See I look at myself as a Spiritual Being Having a Human Experience.
Let me tell you it has not been fun or comforting, really until now.
I know I am leaving here and that is ok now, where I will wind up we will see.
I do have places I go to now but I doubt that is where I will end up, although I would not mind.
Some of the humorous things I find is my wife calling me, Joe, Joseph, Joseph where are you, and turn to her and say what rather with a little terseness, see she has called me back from where I was.
She asks me who have I been talking to and where was I.
By this time I have no idea of what the heck she is talking about, because it is gone from me.
She tells me I was sitting there talking and moving my hands and looking out as if I could see who it was.
Maybe she should join the conversation, who knows what might take place.
Some of our family discussions at the dinner table are just, well right out of a sitcom.
For me especially because it does not take long for me to get lost in them and not know what is going on, let alone why I have this plate of stuff in front of me.
I even laugh at myself when I fall.
Everyone gets so concerned and all I do is lay there and laugh.
See I find these things to be funny, why because I am laughing at myself and my own stubbornness' at times.
Like climbing on a ladder, no business being on one, and the next thing I know the ladder went for a walk and I met the floor on my back and head.
Do not get the wrong idea, this world of Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia are without a doubt terrifying.
Not only to those who take care of us, and we can be a real handful to deal with, but to us that wander in the fog of it.
See we not only have to try and live in your reality, but we are forced into a different reality, the World of Dementia.
A life of continual forgetfulness and being lost and not knowing where you are one minute to the next.
Filled with frustration, aggravation, not being able to do the things you once could.
Sitting down to do something and there you sit because you do not have a hint of what it was you were going to do.
I had to take a break from this for a couple of hours, because my brain hurt and stopped talking to my hands and I did not know what to write or say.
I do know one thing that someday I will be set free from this life of different Joe's and be just Joe in yet another reality.
God Bless & Keep You & This Country of Ours!

Today is a day that my ears and soul are fillled with tears.
They are tears of joy, sadness and yes jealousy.
My comrad in arms from the Alzheimer's Project, Memory The Loss Tapes, Yolanda Sanmartino, The Lady in The Mirror passed away 3 days ago.
I got a very short but simple email from her son Roberto, informing me of her passing.
And thanking us for remembering her and checking.
Today one note has come down from my computer desk, that is the one that reminded me to check on Yolanda and the info i needed.
I feel kind of alone today.
There were seven of us in that documentary and now I am the last left here.
All the others have been set free now.
The bus keeps passing me by and not stopping.
I find no humor this day so far, this damn bastardly disease has yet claimed another friend.
When will people hear us?

Yes I have been informed by my wife that i have acquired a new job while i sleep away the niight.
I SING, look out the next Caruso is being born.
Also i am talking in clear voice as well, now that can become a problem, if i reply to questions.
My secret past will come out and I will no longer hold that mystery about me.
Who says there is no fun in Alzheimer's has never had it or forgot to look.
I just thought i would pass this on.
The never ending  story of the Alzheimer's journey, adventure at every turn.

I have met so many people since I started this blog, and i am lucky if I can tell you five of them.
There is Carol, who for some reason thinks i know what I am talking about.
Dr. Joe Sivak who has gone on to greater fame and forgotten us little folks, i know doc i am a pain in the ass.
My friends Mary and Jim who live in canada.
I know there are many ofthers my email list shows it.
Hey you old Navy guy Dr. Gordon, I still know you.
The last week or more has been a real doosey for me.
I have ussed the old brain cell way tooooo much and gotten exhausted, shaky, a bit lost in time.
I helped a friend redo his computer after it was totallly infected and that took a couple of days to retreive everything for him and my head hurt and i felt like a zombie.
Tax season, somebody shoot me.
Then I put Windows 8 onn my machine, nice program.
But I did a refresh without finding out what that really was, my thoughts and its thoughts just did not agree.
It cleaned my machine and I had to re-install almost all of my programs, in the process I signed up for stuff that my wife had to get me out of, I have been a mess, I do not even understand the notes that I have made so I do not forget, toooo much fog and dust up in the old brain.
I guess I should keep it simple but I have that inner pit bull in me that does not want to let go even though I am not winning at fixing and doing things.
This disease Alzheimer's and the FTD, they hit hard when they punch back, a lot harder than I can.
Wanted to let you all know for better or worse I still am being a pain in the ass to those around me, just doing my job.
God Bless & Keep You & This Country of Ours!

Yes I am still here you lucky people.
Thought you might like to know that Yolanda from the documentary as of 15 minutes ago was still with us and fighting.
Things are getting screwery in my world.
I know that the computer and calendar say it is 2013, but I am trying to figure out where 2011 & 2012 went.
I do not remember them hardly.
We just got back from northern California visitig my daughter her hubby and 4 kids for a few days.
My older daughter joined us with her 4, yess Lynn & I got a room for me to escape to.
8 grandkids and their parents is definetly more than I can handle.
Extra drugs help but only to a point.
Physically things are still going the wrong way and that includes that brain cell that i have.
If Lynn had not told me, I thought that I have been posting regularly, not so Mr.
Brain.
I listen to all that they say is happening in research and trials as much as i can and actually i still not heard or remember if they have even come up with a definative cause for Alzheimer's.
Treatment does not seem to moved any further than a shot in the dark still.
For me my world seems smaller and lonlier, my brain does not seem to really take in things around me anymore.
Sleep and just stareing at the TV seem to be all that hold any interest no matter how hard I tried to pretend that I am with it.
Oh well It Is What It Is.
take care until next time.
God Bless & Keep You & This Country of Ours!

I find that it is easier to write here then to talk to others.
I feel like things are becoming more confused and i am not sure wht the hell i am doing.
I try to hide moset things and find it is getting harder.
I try to remain happy on the outside, but inside is not so anymore.
My days are just that days.
they mean little, they hold no interest for me.
I find being secluded much more frienndly.
I feeel like everyone is watching me and not leaving me alone.
The other day the shower door and I took a walk out of the shower.
it is getting difficult to even take a shower.
even worse harder to remember when and if i took one.
this is the way life is for me now.
I find it hard to enjoy my family and am beginning to drift from them, i wonder if this is the way it is for others, having some trouble finding the keys, fingers keep moombing around.
Good thing for the drugs or I would looose it aroung everyone, the anger and distrust level in me is rising.
i really am not in control too much anymore, i guess that is ok. the more i leave go of things the easier it seems to be, the less emotional i am and the less my head hurts.
take care until next time.

alicespicer2003@yahoo.comMessage = Hi.
My name is Alice Spicer, and I have recently launched a non-profit organization dedicated to eliminating the stigma associated with Alzheimer's and dementia through publication of creative work.
Basically, I want to provide a platform for their voices to penetrate nursing home walls and be heard in the public arena.Here is our website: http://alzheimerchronicles.comI am writing to ask your support in helping people become aware of a fundraising campaign we are doing for the first publication, "Alzheimer Chronicles: The Invisible Poets," an illustrated collection of short stories.
After almost two years worth of weekly storytelling workshops, I think it is about time that others are exposed to these valuable stories.
The cognitively unchallenged people in this world have a lot to learn from our forgetful friends.Here is a video, which demonstrates the level of depth and meaning in their stories:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx_kI8e0Q7EI hope that you will pass this information along to your friends and colleagues.
Our campaign, on Kickstarter.com ends December 5th.
We have about 24% funding so far, with 21 days to go.Thank you for your time and consideration.Take care,Alice Spicer God Bless & Keep You & This Country of Ours!

<doc date=Tuesday, November 20, 2012>
I have not posted recently on my own life.
It seems to be getting more and more out of my control.
Trying to remember to do things is nearing the statem of impossibility.
Yet writing seems to still work for me.
I was reading an article about a new gene they have found that works on the immune system and seems that it has some affects on Alzhiemers.
What gene damned if I remember.
But it only helps to confirm my non medical opinion that this disease is an auto imune disease.
If i find the article in my notes i keep to help me i will post it.
I know they are looking at stem cells as well and they hold some possible hope.
I  am finding it more difficult to post I do not know what to say anymore.
I am tired of trying to really reach out and get our voices heard.
I went back in my archives, I have been doing this blog for over six years and feel like i have gotten no where.
Yes many of you have told me how it helps, i do read the comments that is how i know when you yell back at me.
The fuzzieness of this world is getting very hard to get throught.
being quiet and not talking seems to becomming more the way I want to be.
I prefer being left alone to drift off to other places that are kinder and more pleasant than this.
Notes are starting to hang on my computer desk to help me remember things again and again i forget to look at them.
enough for today.
Be kind to yourselves.

To all those on the East Coast my prayers and hopes go to you in your hour of need.
Only you know your real pain and frustration with getting the help you need.
It will get better I believe that, just stay fast and believe.
Hurricane Sandy left you in one hell of a mess and I wish I could change that for you.
I have been home now about a week i think.
I have been informed that my timeline of our trip is a bit screwed up and locations, that does not surprise me.
Time and days all seem to be the same to me and have ben for some time now.
So I guess at the day.
Loooooking at the alendaes not help, since i donot know what day it is.
I am still very tired from the trip, but glad that my daughter got to check off of her list somethings she has wanted to do.
I am really confused with this disease, my short term memory of late seems betterm but my long term seems to have gone on vacation.
Alzheimer's truly affects us all differently but still progresses to its final run.
Many of you know that all this rah rah rh about bresast cancer burns my ass, because the main stream seems to not care about us.
I want no one to get cancer and surely not this disease.
Here is my problems did some reasearch and found out form the CDC and Breast Cancer.org that in 2011, 39,250 people died from breast cancer, that is both MEN and Women (mostly women).
Yes men we can get it also.
That was another 3-4% decrease.
Frolm the CDC and other agencies that collect this info that in 2011 somewhere between 82,435 to 83,208 people died from ALZHEIMER'S, both men and women and ladies here is the kicker your made up the majority of those deaths.
So again I ask: Which is more important BREASTS or YOUR BRAIN?
For me take my breasts and my genitiles and leave my brain alone, but at last I and millions have no chance for a cure or real help, Think about it.About 78 seconds each day another person is diagnosed with Alzheimer's, they receive their double Death Sentence, first there being then their life.

Well he is in Lake Bluff, Illinois.
After a much heroing journey through California to the Nevada border and the City of Sin, Las Vegas (actually loss wages), my daughter subjected me to the towering hieghts of Colorado, not only did she try to dump me off the mountains, she had the nerve to even drive through tunnels in them.
She tried to get rid of me at 10,361 feet, buy i am a tuff bugger.
I hang on for dear life, terrified of hieghts.
We visited a wildlife refuge in Ritchfield, Co. Had to rid my sscooter on a 35 ft high ramp to view the animals.
What a neat experience that was.
Only bad part it was cold and windy as all get out.
We left Colorado and went on into Utah, what a beautiful State and the color of the mountains is just outstanding.
from there we went onto Nebraska, got off the freeway to find the zoo we were goinhg to see in the morning, but aliens had removed it from existence, so onto Omaha to spend the night and see the Omaha zoo.
well i will leave it there for now.
I and my daughter are both extremely wornen out, but we will survive.
I know i left out alot of things but the brain does not want to give them to me to write.
Really gets me upset and I miss my home and wife and feel very uncomfortable at this point.

you can turn off my usual song if you wish.
I do request you listen to the new song I have embeded from You Tube on the right.
I cried.
I will be going on a road trip with my youngest starting next monday, so i may not post for awhile.
We will head to Chicago, stopping at zoos on the way, and then seeing some of my old town.
We are going to THE CHICAGO BEARS GAME vs detroit lions on the 22nd.
Then will be heading home.
To tell the truth i am afraid of this trip, i will be away from my security place, away from lynn, my fish and that which i am familiar with and that scares me.
In a prior post i believe a gave you a link to a new short film, Shattered Love, that is in production for you review.
I have yelled long enough about a voice on this blog, so when asked I decided to put my money where my mouth is and have become an executive producer, on of some.
so there you hav it from the big brain in Oceanside, CA.

I was approached by the following to post something on Stem Cell Research and how it can possibly help brain disorders and others.
Normally I do not do this but I found this interesting and thought you might also.
I did not write this as you will see, the company is acknowledged and the end and I was given written permisssion to post it.
Five Factoids on Stem Cells International Stem Cell Awareness Day - October 3, 2012 Stem cells have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of human disease.
Scientists and researchers have been working diligently to unlock the potential of stem cells and significant strides have been made in the less than 15 years since the discovery of a method to grow and replicate human stem cells.
Stem cells allow scientists to study human development (and how it could go wrong), develop better and safer drugs and offer potential treatments for devastating diseases and injuries.
#1: Stem cells are "master" cells that have the ability to grow into any one of the body's more than 200 cell types, including brain, blood, pancreas and heart cells.
#2: Stem cells can reproduce into red cells that carry oxygen throughout the body, white cells for fighting infections and platelets that create clots and prevent excessive bleeding.
#3: Stem cell research is predicted to improve treatment options for incurable conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, spinal cord injuries and traumatic brain injuries, among many others.
#4: Scientists are conducting stem cell studies to develop cures for the more than 1.3 million Americans that suffer from spinal cord injuries.
This is highly significant because no other form of treatment or drugs have been able to restore function for patients with paralysis.
#5: Stem cells can self-renew.
They are capable of replenishing themselves for long periods of time.
Through natural division, one Petri dish can hold up to 5 million pluripotent stem cells meaning scientists can create normal human cells in large scale for the first time in human history.
"This is a critical and historic time for stem cell research," said Peter Donovan, director, Sue & Bill Gross Stem Cell Research Center, UC Irvine.
"We're literally on the brink of developing new treatments for countless life-threatening illnesses and debilitating injuries, and raising awareness about this research is one of the best things people can do to help accelerate the process." There are several research programs taking place at the Sue & Bill Gross Stem Cell Research Center at UC Irvine that continue to break down barriers and open doors to new treatments for major diseases and injuries including Alzheimer's Disease.
An estimated 35 million people worldwide suffer from Alzheimer's disease, five million of whom live in the U.S.  Frank LaFerla, Ph.D., director of UC Irvine's Institute for Memory Impairments and Neurological Disorders, andMatthew Blurton-Jones, Ph.D. of the Sue & Bill Gross Stem Cell Research Center, UC Irvine, have shown potential treatment in humans.
Their work with stem cells is expected to move to clinical trials within five years.
Support stem cell research.

Some or many of you do not know Jim McMahon.
He was the quarterback for my Super Bowl Champions, The Chicago Bears is 1985.
To me one of the great one's, not afraid to get hit or do what it took to win the game.
Not like some of the sissys today.
Jim at the age of 53 now has dementia, not Alzheimer's, Lewy Bodies, Frontal Temporal or any of the others.
He has the new one specially named for retired football players, chronic traumatic encephalopathy (that was cute and paste).
Comes from toooooo many wacks in the head they say.
Sorry Jim, you are still a favorite of mine, but now we have something in common, brains kind of scrambled.
I often wonder if my Alzheimer's and Frontal Temporal Dementia are not tied to the wonderful car door slams to my head that my wonderful asshole of a father took delight and delivering to me.
Or the hits in the head by the swings in school or those from the teeterboards or whatever the where.
Possibly my wonderful abilithy to fall and crack my head on the cement.
Oh well whatever the cause we have it don't we Jim?
Truly i am sorry for your condition, it is not fun.
Believe me I and millions of others know that and wish you well.
You can always contact me and we can chat, talk or write.
Just know there are a great number of us out here who stand shoulder to shoulder with you.
God Bless & Keep You & This Country of Ours!

today has been a rather calm day for me.
after the last few weeks it is much welcomed.
i still do not sort things out well, but i am a bit more aware i think this day.
i think i have acquired sleep life away syndrome.
I get up about 8 am do my morning stuff sit down and it is noon or one oclock already.
Next I know it is 4 or 5 diner time.
Yes i sleep about 7 hours at night, but tht does not seem to matter.
I have sat down a number of times this week to post, but as usual i just go dormant and cannot remember what i want to say or why i am at th computer.
Lynn handles the check book now.
I have to contact the DMV license renewal time.
Although i do not drive anylonger, they will probably not renew my license, test and i will not get along.
Just another part of one's life taken away by this fricken pain in the ass disease.
it is getting harder to keep some sense of humor and my mouth shut.
It is what it is.
till next time take care of yourselves.

There is a new community some of you may or may not know of now on the web.
I have joined it,  it consists of people involved with Alzheimer's, sufferers, caregivers, etc.
It is called The Alzheimer's Community   , you can register and join, of course it is free.
Come take a look and help spread the word.
My world has been very mixed up lately.
I really do not know what is going on in it much anymore.
Lynn has to do the check book now, even the calculator does not do what i wnat it to do.
Talking is becmoing one of those one time I knew how to do that and make sense.But that is the way it goes.
I sit here and have all these things to say and when I go to they go somewhere other than on this page, it pisses me off.
Making a decisssion for me takes alot of time.
So much that I forget what it is that I am trying to answer or do.

The last couple of days have been really a fricken mess.
Right now I can think kind of stratight.
Over the last days I have forgotten what i was doin, how i got where I did and from where i got there.
Talking has been utterly confussing even to me.
I have needed help in getting around physically, legs did not want to work, when they did they wanted to go somewhere other than I was headed.
Good things for walls and hand rails or I would have surelly met the floor.
That damned thing kept moving on me.
I feel like a plane, i have to make a wide circle to get to where i am goinging.
Things seem to be happening quickly now, with more and more bad days and days i cannot remember.
I can no longer tell you by the evening what I did in the morning , let alone yesterday and the past is fading as well.
I am starting to feeel best just sitting in quiet and not talking or being talked to or having the boob tube on.
It has become dangerous for me in the shower.
Good thing it is not real wide or I would definitely get swaying from side to side and go through the doors.
Even sitting on the seats we have in it has become an experience as my wet ass slides off and old shaking legs can barely keep me up there.
Till next time, be good to yourselves.

A couople of weeks ago i posted that i was taking coconut oil becaues i promised a friend.
Well still am and have nothing to report.
It goes in and comes out.
I remain the same and am getting a little bit worse each and evry day.
So will continue and report.
So far as i am concerned it is a ll HYPE, btu just because no hlep here so far does not mean that it might not help some people for a time.
We had the radio show on Alzheimer's Speaks Radio.
I had a good time talking with Lori and feel good that someone agrees that our voices need to be heard and listened to.
We may do it again some day.
Will try to get link to the actual broadcast so you can hear it.
I have to say taht after the hour I was shot the rest of the day.
I cannot concentrate that long and stay foccused without my head and body letting me know about it.
If any of you listened I hope you enjoyed and would appreceiate hearing from you.
Now i need to fight another battle my body chringes at temps over 75, I just become worthless, more so.
For now take care of yourselves.

I have added new resource sites again, soon will need a website for them alone.
I went fishing behind my pond the other night.
A hose ame loose on the filtering system and Mr.
Fix It, went out after midnight to meet the challenge.
Well all went well, connected the hose back up got the system running again, stood up turned and immediately found myself tangled up on the ground in the plants, a plant stand in the dark.
Just a badly bruised ego, some bruses scratches and aches but I am use to that, I am not stable a foot.
One thing I do to try and keep my well let us say graying matter working, is to do towels for the week on Friday, yes that is today.
I got up did normal cleansing stuff, changed all the towels, put the dirty ones in the washer and behold it cleaned them.
I put them in the dryer, mind you this was about 9am, it is now 7pm.
My wife came home about 11am I aksed her where she had been, she gave me that look and said I told you I was going shopping.
OK.
I just now asked what day it was and was told Friday, immediately my wife said the towels, well you got it they were stilll in the drlyer.
So I just finished folding them and putting them away, a bit behind my time.
Don't forget Tuesday to listen to the radio web show, well i guess better said i do not forget to get on it.
Life in the world of Alzheimer's never a remembering moment.

Yes you lucky buggers at 9am PST on Tuesday, August 28, 2012, yours truly will be babbling on Alzheimer's Speaks Radio on the Web.
Click on title of show below.
There is a phone number that you can call in on and ask questions.
Suggest 10 minutes before show time, not sure if you can during the show.
But you get one hour of me if I last.
Lori La Bay is the host and runner of the site.
Making Choices For Those Who Can't & Living with Dementia A side note of sorts, I promised a friend that I would try the Coconut Oil and I have been.
To this point I cannot say anything except I have not died from it.
No changes to my inabilities at all, in fact my balance is even worse and moving this battleship from spot to spot is getting harder.
I am sure that has nothing to do with the coconut oil.
My brain cells are still scrambled and bouncing alll over eahc other more so.
Those of you that may remember The HBO Alzheimer's Project and the PBS The Forgetting, with joy for those who passed there are only 5 of us still in this miserable state, Yolanda Sanmartino, Chuck Jackson, Isabel McKenna, Nacho Sanchez and myslef, that is all out of about 11+ or so of us.

I read you else was chosen and what tickles me is that I know most of the folks and follow their blogs, and I say to them good going.
Belosw is what Health Line wrote on their site: _______________________________________________________________ Living With Alzheimer's Meet Joe.
As funny and frank as it gets, his Living With Alzheimer's blog is making waves.
Both inspirational and incisive, his wit and laid-back approach to life somehow make it easier to grapple with the challenges brought by dementia.
Joe is no stranger to the effects of Alzheimer's, but he faces the difficulties of the disease and makes the battle less painful - and certainly less isolating - by adding humor and casual grace into the mix.
Stop by to give Joe some virtual applause for leading the way to a future of dignity, perseverance, and hope for everyone with dementia.

My daughter is down with her hubby and 4 kids, and of course my other daughter and her 4 kids and hubby come over and my son and his sweetie, my wife, mother-in-law and youngest daughter, just waaaaaay toooooo much for me.
I have to admit things have been ok, but then i must confess i have used extra meds to help.
Monday i completely came apart and i guess i was less than friendly, rather a bastard.
So appologies had to be ginen, i hate those things.
We were at the Write On, book authors of Oceansided get together yesterday.
That was fun, got to ride my new scooter and meet other writers and make some friends.
Do not ask me who they are I have no idea.
This disease is a real brain buster, sometimes I feel like i am ok and others i am in another world.
damn things switches on and off throughout the day, drives me and those around me a bit batty.my headaches are getting worse, but doc says things are ok, but what the hell do they know, they just practice medicine.
I am very drained this week and the kids will all be back today - Oh i can hardly wait.
well back to the drugs and some food.
Even met more folks who have loved ones with this disease Saturday, amazing how they are comming out of the wood.
Take care of yourselves to the next time.

A short story by Joseph V. Potocny Let us go back in time as far as our minds will travel till when this war began and the battles raged on day and night for centuries.
Our setting is in times of old, set among the rolling tree lined hills and grass lands of a land known as the LAND OF DARKNESS.
Through the glens ran rivers filled with fish and clear waters and lakes that sprawled across the land.
Many a village dotted the landscape with one mighty fortress in the center of all that could be seen.
The villagers went about their daily business of selling goods, cleaning their shops and homes, repairing their roofs and greeting one another.
In the background one could hear the noise of battle, the clashing and crushing of metal and the helpless cries of those engaged in this never ending war that seemed to have no rhyme or reason to it.
Yet one could hear the roar of cheers and adulations being boosted upon the victor as the gayety of the event went on.
For years the war raged with hardly a person caring who was or was not winning; only that it gave them excitement in their otherwise hum drum lives.
Then came a cold and blustery fall day, the skies were darkened and the winds swirled throughout the land.
The reviewing stands were filled to over flowing with crowds of frenzied on lookers.
It was difficult to see what was taking place through the dust and debris flying in the air.
But yet all in attendance cheered and screamed and ate all that they could and laughed among themselves.
Suddenly two hours past the rising of the sun in midday sky the clouds began to part.
The massive clouds of dust seemed to clear and a quietness never before felt in the Land of Darkness could be felt.
People closed their eyes, covered their mouths and ears as they gazed upon the carnage that years of battles in this war they really cared nothing about could be seen.
DEATH was all about the land, where it was once green now it was scared and torn by the ravages of the war.
Ones they had known for years were among the slaughtered and dismembered bodies that lay for the scavengers to feast upon.
But not to worry, they were safe in the stands and had others to talk to and while the time away.
Suddenly could be heard the thunderous ponding of the hooves of a mighty beast coming towards the field from the east.
All turned their eyes and cheered wildly and appeared a mountainous mass of a steed black as coal with what looked like the very smoke of hell coming from its nostrils.
His mighty hooves gleamed in the sun and as they hit the ground one after the other a shaking and rattling of the stands could be felt by all.
The crowds went wild, when atop this mighty mount sat the Black Knight.
His dark plumage all twirl in the wind, armor black as the night and gleaming.
His battle axe hanging on his side, a might mace stuck in his saddle.
As he rode towards the crowd his lance stood tall in his mighty arm, with his colors of red trailing behind it.
He slowly made his way to the east end of the jousting pad and sat so tall and mighty that he seemed to block out much of what could be seen.
From the west end of the battle field a soft but mounting laughter started to be heard.
All eyes turned toward that end of the field and there they say the cause of this gaiety.
Standing there on a Roan Steed was a war torn and embattled knight.
His stature was not even half that of the Black Knight.
His page even had to help him stay steady on his charge.
The crowd could hardly contain themselves as the starter slowly made his way up the tower to play his part in this drama.
As he neared the end of his climb the weather seemed to change, a chill entered the air and the skies seem to darken, by this time night was starting to fall.
The Starter reached the top of his post he showed the white cloth to the Black Knight, who dipped his lance in acknowledgement.
He then turned to the old knight and he dipped his lance toward the starter and almost dismounted.
None of the money changers would take bet on this battle; one could plainly see who the victor would be.
The starter dropped his cloth, the Black Nights mount could hardly be contained waiting for the cloth to strike the ground.
The Cloth hit the ground the massive beast reared and roared a mighty sound and the smoke of hell came forth from his nostrils.
His mighty feet hit the dirt with such a force that the earth cracked, mountains trembled and the reviewing stands did weaken.
Forward charged the Black Knight with his lance lowered.
The Old Knight sat himself right and lowered his lance and started his charge.
Suddenly seeing his braveness and lack of fear the jeers started to turn to cheers.
They charged towards one another in the dimming light and met with such a clash as never before heard that many fell out of their seats.
A cloud of thick and dark dust was swirling in the middle of the field.
The sound of metal ripping, wood snapping and the cries of pain and horror could be heard.
Then all went silent.
No one knew what had happened.
But slowly the tail and hind quarters of the Black Knights mount could be seen.
Soon the knight and his entire mount were standing tall at their starting point.
Where was the old knight?
A light rain and breeze came up and the center of the field could be seen.
There laid broken battle axes, maces, the Black Knights sword and the proud Roan Steed.
But the Old Knight was not to be seen.
All were just besides themselves, how could this be?
Then one cried out look.
As all looked to the west end, there standing in the setting sun was the Old Knight; how he was able to stand no one could phantom a guess.
But yet there he was standing, with half a shield, leaning on his sword and bloodied beyond belief the battle that had just been fought.
As the last rays of the sun cast across the field the Starter raised his hand, the Black Knight raised his shield and so did the Old Knight.
Down came the starters hand and like a blur the beast from hell was racing towards the end of the field.
The Black Knight lowered his lance, which was already drench with the blood of his opponent and took deadly aim.
Darkness fell just as the two met once again.
This time the collision had a different tone to it but still there was so much dust and in the darkness hardly a thing could be seen.
Finally, after what seemed like years the moon broke through the clouds and the wind swept across the field once more, to reveal the finality of this battle.
There at the west end to the amazement of all, laid both the Black Knight his charge and the Old Knight.
Pages ran to the scene to see what was and signaled to all that both were dead.
The crowd demanded the helmet of the Black Knight be removed so they could see who this valiant warrior of so many battles and years was.
However his face was so deformed and twisted and hair all in knots that no one could tell who he was or where came from.
The Old Knights page removed his face plate to reveal his master, instead of a face a spiral plume of bluish white smoke ascended to the heavens.
As is raced upward a great sound could be heard and then a burst of silver, gold and white flakes fell towards the earth.
All could hear the words clearly, I Am Free, finally.
The flakes fell across the entire battle field and all that laid there was consumed as if it never was.
All looked to where the Black Knight and his companion had laid upon the field.
A twisting wind blew across the spot and there where they had lain was written: My Name Was Alzheimer's.
The crowd now knew what they had not done, but one lone soul sacrificed their life to do.
God Bless & Keep You & This Country of Ours!

I guess tha is quite a title for me.
But I find that more and more as time goes on, I say things that ssem to just come out.
I am not really sorry either.
I feel more and more each day that my world is growing smaller.
I have a hard time remember faces from my past and those who once held a place in my heart are fading as does an old time picture.
Even those that I thought reallly meant something to me and would never forget.
I seem to be retreaating more into myself these days.
There is a growing sense of urgency I guess in me to get things done.
Not the final stuff, that has been all paid for and completed for sometime now.

I am glad that last week has past, the crashing out of bed, 8.5 hours at the hospital on sunday.
Monday got to relax, the tuesday spent  2 hours iat the dentist, proded and poked and xrayed and open and shut measure this and that, looking into a apnea device for my mouht the mask and i do not get along at all.
Then wednesday, good old phychiatrist, they are so non commital and say keep doing what you doing, well i do not want to.
Dieing sucks, not knowing what day it is anymore sucks, forgetting where the day went sucks, life sucks so there.
Then spent hour and a half at the eye doctors, how wonderful, pull this lid then that one blind me with this light agnd then the next put drops is to measure pressure i guess, that process was met with a bit of resistence, you do not touch my eyes.
Then we put all types of drops in them so I can no longer see shit and they take pictures of them.
Finally the Doctor arrives and he fuckin blinds me with lights.
We discuss a cataract that is in the left eye, he suggested to leave it for now and not operate, smartest thing i heard all week.
But need new glasses.
This week comes and somehow some way a sctrewed up my back and need my brace to move and my scooter to get atround.
I know it ends sometime, but when is that time.

Yes early Sunday AM about 5:15 or so i am told, I was struck in the back of the head, neck shoulders and back by a buick.
I think an ol 1956 Buick Roadmaster for those who remember those tanks.
That is what it sounded like.
See I was having this wonderful dream, I was young and agile again (you know that is a dream), i was playing in traffic in the street, playing dodge um with the cars and doing just a outstandting job of winning.
I made this magnificient  summer sault to avoid a car and go to the other side of the street to the sidewalk.
Then it happened CRASH, BAM POW, Holy Cow Batman, laid out flat this Buick had done me in, sneakoy devil got me from behind.
Well after hearing my name called  for who knows how long there is my wife asking me if i am ok. Well i did not understand how she got there.
The truth be known Mr. Gymnist here apparently did a leg flying high twisting of this very fit body of mine, right out of the bed.
In the process I struck my left ear, back of my poor little head, neck and shoulders on the bedside table.
Not to mention my fat ass on the floor (that was the real crashing noise).
Later in the day when I confessed i could not see well, my head hurt, hell all of me hurt and was more unstable than usual, physicallly that is, we spent the next 8 1/2 hours at the wonerful Hospital Hotel.
Had a CT scan and it showed the following:  No definitive intracranial hemorrhage.
There is a focus of increased density to the posterior left temporal lobe.
No skull fracture.
Mild sinus opacity.
Basil ganglia calcifications (and my very favorite medical language) and other incidental findings.
I guess they found a brain cell.
One good thing the basil thing which has never shown or have I been informed of in right on that part of my ginormous brain that controls your balance, and is an old brain injury that continues to calcify.
What a day.
Take care of yourselves.
God Bless & Keep You & This Country of Ours!

anyone finds that Buick it is mine.

Dear Joseph, It's time to come together and stop Alzheimer's.
America must make stopping Alzheimer's a national priority.
Tell your Senators to invest in research today!
Last week, a Senate panel failed to make a critical investment in Alzheimer's research - a move that ignores the suffering of the five million Americans with Alzheimer's and the millions of Baby Boomers who will get the disease in their lifetime and yearn for a medical breakthrough.
You and I both know that this "business-as-usual" approach won't get us closer to stopping this disease in the coming decade.
We deserve a stronger resolve from our elected representatives - the kind that we saw when Congress unanimously passed the National Alzheimer's Plan and when the Administration put forth a bold goal to prevent and treat this disease.
Luckily, the budget process is just starting, and we still have a chance to make our case to the entire Senate.
Don't let your Senators turn their backs on the millions of people suffering and who will suffer from Alzheimer's and other dementias: tell them we must invest more in research today.
Here's what happened last week: A key Senate committee kept out a proposal to infuse $80 million for Alzheimer's research at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), refusing to provide a much-needed investment to boost Alzheimer's research.
Although these Senators voted to increase modestly the funding for the National Institutes of Health (NIH), we need a committed investment in Alzheimer's research today to try to save millions of lives and trillions of dollars over the coming decades.
Astonishingly, Congressional leaders refused to allocate a basic investment in Alzheimer's research.
Our leaders failed us last week.
As engaged and enraged advocates, we must hold them accountable.
They need to know that we won't let them continue with their "business-as-usual" approach to Alzheimer's.
Tell your Senators: Join the advocates, researchers, and industry leaders who have come together to stop Alzheimer's in the next decade - invest in research now.
Our elected officials want to do the right thing.
Many of them have been touched by this disease and want to stop it - just like you and me.
But without public pressure for an expanded investment in Alzheimer's research, they'll continue to sidestep this issue and continue to offer the same insufficient response to what we know is the great public health crisis of our time.
That's why I'm so grateful you'll join me in speaking out today.
Thank you.
Sincerely, George VradenburgChairmanUSAgainstAlzheimer's USAgainstAlzheimer's is a community of enraged and engaged individuals who have been touched by Alzheimer's disease and are committed to the bold and attainable goal of ending Alzheimer's by 2020.

as always we do not promote or recommend any products, you are the ultimate decision maker in you purchases.
we try to bring things to aide and possibly be of use to you.
Sure, your smart phone might be a great way to fling disgruntled birds at thieving swine, but it can also be just as useful in helping you care for an elderly parent or a special needs child.
Right now, more than three in ten households report that at least one person has served as an unpaid caregiver.
Taking this into account, developers have begun to release a wide variety of apps that can make providing care much easier.
From scheduling medications to tracking lost loved ones, there's almost no limit to what these programs can do.
So if you have a dependent at home, you should definitely consider downloading these 5 apps.
1)    Med Helper - $3.99.
Med Helper provides caregivers with the most comprehensive medication scheduling suite on the market.
Available for the Android and iPhone, the app tracks medication, treatment and appointment schedules for your loved one.
In addition to alerting you when it's time to give a patient their pills, Med Helper Pro also tracks your prescription inventory and lets you know when it's time to get a refill.
It even creates a log of past doses that you can export and show to your healthcare professionals.
If providing medication is part of your daily routine, this is one app that you need to get.
2)    ICE - $3.99.
ICE, by development firm Appventive, is a high-tech "In Case of Emergency" app.
It functions just like the diabetic bracelets that people use to inform medical workers about their condition, but the app can convey very detailed information.
With just one click, EMT staff or other medical professionals will know the person's conditions, emergency contact numbers and insurance information.
You can include phone numbers for doctors, information about allergic reactions and special instructions.
Though the app is currently exclusive to the Android operating system, look for it to expand to the iPhone soon.
3)    Pain Care - Free.
When you're sitting in the doctor's office, it can be difficult to remember every single thing you wanted to say about how you've been since your last visit.
Pain Care, the winner of the "Project HealthDesign," says it for you.
The app, which is available for free on Android, Blackberry and iPhone, is a kind of pain management journal.
A pain slider allows patients to rate their level of pain as well as its duration, location, triggers and more.
In-depth information like this gives your doctor a clear picture of your condition over time.
4)    GPS Tracking Pro - Free.
Caring for a family member who is suffering from Alzheimer's or dementia can be difficult, especially when they start losing track of their surroundings.
A simple walk alone can quickly turn into an emergency if your parent or grandparent forgets how to get back home.
The GPS Tracking Pro app will allow your family member to retain their independence by keeping tabs on their location 24 hours a day.
Just load the free app onto their Android or iPhone, and you'll be able to track their location from your phone or computer.
5)    Brainwave Tuner - $2.99.
Brainwave Tuner can be a useful app for those who suffer from fits, migraines, insomnia and other stressful conditions.
Binaural acoustic therapy aims to help people achieve a more relaxed state of mind by coaxing brainwaves to entrain with a gently pulsing audio source.
Brainwave Tuner projects special ambient sounds through headphones to help relieve pain and induce sleep.
The app is currently available for iPhone and Android phones.
Being a caregiver isn't easy, but these apps can make looking after a loved one with special needs much less trying than it used to be.
Apps like these turn your smartphone into an emergency device, a medication scheduler or an acoustic therapy device at the touch of a button, and as technology continues to advance, these apps will only become more helpful.
So check out your operating system's app store today and download a few that you think might be useful in providing care for your family or loved ones.
For such a small price, they can be a big help.
hope you enjoy this and find some useful inforation.
You can tell i did not write this, you can read it.
God Bless & Keep You & This Country of Ours!

The other day i do not remember when it was my younest daughter and i were siting on the couch talking and I looked at her and could not remember her name.
Which is Kathryn.
I tried to say it but i just was not able to.
Finally it came out and she just looked at me and said you forgot my name, tried to cover it up, but she had me dead to rites.

sounds like a soap opera, but that is what is happening to my life.
My eldest and her group were here the other day and when I said goodbye to my granddaughert who is 9, she aaid grandpa why don't you call me that name anymore when we leave and i did not know what she was talking ablut and asked her, she said oh it is ok grandpa, you just don't remember things anymore.
That kind of hit home as to she understands and can see the changes taking palace.
My daughter and I think it was the same day told me she missed me and i was really lost on that one.
I just looked at her and she told me she misses how we would jokw around and that i do not do that much anymore but she understood that things were getting harder for me.
It almost felt like she said goodbye while she still could.
Right now i feel like shit and am not in a good place, which seems to becoming normal.

Tips for Helping Someone With Alzheimer's Disease Handle Daily Life Caring for someone who has Alzheimer's disease can be a frustrating experience.
The person who takes on the role of their nurse, companion and protector must remain patient and flexible when planning and tackling the different practical aspects of the disease.
At the same time, they must deal with their own heartbreak and strong emotions.
There are many ways of dealing with everyday routines in such a way that life can run as smoothly as possible for all concerned.
Here are just a few suggestions that could help ensure safety and maintain dignity in five 'typical' situations.
Communication The disease erodes communication skills, therefore the person's words and behaviour may seem, at first, to make little or no sense - they may have trouble understanding what you want to say to them too.
This can be extremely frustrating and distressing; however, there are ways to ease the situation.
Speak clearly, maintaining eye contact and using simple language and sentence structure.
Ask 'yes or 'no' questions and keep your tone respectful and calm.
Never interrupt them when they are speaking, and avoid too many distractions - turn off the radio and try not to hold complicated conversations when you are out on a busy street.
Use visual cues.
For instance, you could point to the toilet if you want to ask the person if they need to use the bathroom.
Try not take it personally.
After all, the gentleman who used to be able to confidently arrange all his finances and insurance, including classic car insurance  for his beautiful vintage mustang, himself every single year, or the lady who ran a busy household single-handedly must now battle this degenerative disease to make even the simplest of basic needs or preferences understood.
Mealtimes In the earlier stages, the person will be better able to cope with preparing and eating food independently.
However, as they grow more dependent on you, it will be up to you to make sure they maintain a healthy, regular diet.
Good nutrition is crucial, to avoid physical weakness and infections.
Make sure the person is comfortable when eating.
Check that dentures fit well and that prescribed drugs are not interfering with certain foods or inhibiting the appetite.
You may need to help the person with the physical act of using a knife and fork - and remind them of table manners if appropriate.
Reduce mealtime distractions to a minimum- turn off the phone and TV and clear the table of any unnecessary items, such as magazines or flowers.
If you are not able to be with the person when they eat, make sure they know how to prepare the food or heat it up safely.
Medical visits As with any disease of this seriousness, regular medical visits cannot be avoided.
They can be a useful chance to connect with the person's doctor and medical team and to ask any questions you may have.
However, you can only get the most out of these appointments if you prepare the person who has Alzheimer's disease for them as best as you can.
Try to fix the appointment at a time of day when you know that the person will be at their best and, if possible, when the medical waiting room will be quietest.
Bring snacks, a drink, any required medication and an activity to keep the person happy while waiting.
Make a list of all the points you want to raise with the doctor in advance - keeping your queries as specific as possible.
When in the room, take notes of everything that is said and, if the person wants to answer the doctor themselves, sit yourself behind them so you can quietly nod or shake your head in support of their replies.
The Holidays Preparing for the holidays can be a bitter-sweet occasion: you remember how the person used to celebrate or participate in holidays of yore.
Yet you can still glean happy times from spending holidays with a loved one with Alzheimer's if you do a little forward planning.
Consider what the person used to enjoy about the season and try to include them in the same activities as much as possible.
If they used to bake the cake, get them to measure or stir in the ingredients.
Let them help you wrap gifts - concentrate on the process rather than the end result and rejoice in their efforts and involvement.
Tone down the decorations, as too much unfamiliar 'razzle-dazzle' can cause distress.
Avoid lighting candles and other potential safety hazards and do not display replica fruit or berries, as this might prove confusing.
Keep music and celebrations low key with plenty of chances for naps and breaks away from the party.
Schedule visitors for the person's best time of day and judge how long they should stay by how the person is coping.
Try to have a few visitors on separate days instead of everyone at once if possible.
Sleep Sleep disturbances can take their toll on both you and the person you are caring for.
Often, Alzheimer's disease can reverse a person's former sleep patterns, causing drowsiness in the day and periods of wakefulness at night.
This can progress until deep nightly sleep is replaced with less restorative round-the-clock naps.
Consider cutting down the person's caffeine and alcohol intake, especially in the evenings.
If they insist on a drink, serve them a soft drink or non-alcoholic wine or beer in their favourite glass.
Sleeping pills are generally discouraged for people with Alzheimer's disease, as they can cause confusion, which can then lead to falls.
Instead, plan the day so that the person starts off at their most active, then winds down physically towards bedtime.
Establish a bedtime routine and leave a night light on in their room for comfort.

Bobby Vee was a pop singer in the 1960s, diagnosed with Alzheimer's a year ago, he is now 69.
See not an old farts disease.
I welcmoe him to this World of Ours so that he knows, should he ever read this blog that he is not alone he now has a family of millions and growing by the minute.
So welcome friend.
I also learned last evening, I think it was, that my Son-in-laws father has been diagnosed with Stage 1 Alzheimer's six months ago.
They just found out.
The man is I think 10 years my junior.
Looks like what we have said all along from the beginning of this blog, Alzheimer's is not jus an old persons disease.
Which the Alz.org finally in recent weeks has said, some folks are just slower than others.
My day has just been a day, mostly sleeping this morning, finally getting on this beast and ready to go off somewhere else.
If you do not want to comment, you can just rate a post, check interesting, thank you and what ever the other one is.
At least that will let me know that the posts are read.
Thanks for being there for me.

For a number of years now my friend Ken in the UK has been blogging about LWD, Mary and Jim in Canada about AD, Karen in Israel about AD, Carol and Herb, and a host of others about AD, victims of the disease, Alzheimer's.
Including me.
But this broad coach that has AD now is ELECTRIFING THE WORLD according to the good old Alz.org.
I guess the rest of us are chopped liver, we have no fame and glory.
I have expressed by displeasure in the past for the Alz.org and their lack of ability to take the bull by the horns, I am only one person and make no diff to them, but as of today all my advocate ties and other assosiations with them do not exist.
I have had enough I no longer choose to lower myself to them.
I will continue to write here and tell how life sucks with this disease, how my conversations run a muck and I slowly become whatever.
Those that come and read fine, those who don't oh well.
Frankly i think my blog has run it's coursse and does not reach out anymore.
But it is an outlet for me, and that is all that matttters anylonger to me.
Thank you all for your words about my bird.
She was a peachfaced lovebird.

This has been a hard week for me.
My bird died Easter night.
I was the only one that could handle her, very picky with people.
Her leaving has really messed me up, i come down in the morning and go to uncover her and feed, water, bird talk all that knid of stuff and no cage.
At night I want to cover her and say goodnight again no cage or bird.
She had been ill and sitting with me at nights for long periods cuddeling and sleeping, i knew time was near, but never expetced feeling this lost over it.
I look forher cage and it is not there.
Change is not good for me anymore I have problems with it now.
I find I am angrier inside now than ever, but I fight not to let it out at others, i just leave the room come st here at this beast and do nothing or go in my bedroom and just lay there for awhile.
I find the tremors and my balance worsening daily my head seems to be screwe on sideways this crap has to endlife really is beginning to suck big time.

my days are shorter with sleeping a lot.
have reduced meds.
my brain is not lear on what to say all days seem the same, nothing seems to become any clearer  i just do not know what it is that i want to do anymore, wife leaves things on the calednar and well who the hell looks at it not me.
I cannot remmmeber one moment to the next.
my sense of humor is also leaving.
You know i get upset and then am told to calm down and what i did or said is wrong.
pisses me off.
I feel like just not talking anymore, hell things do not come out right and then i get those looks, you know them you have given them yourselevs me too.
I am starting to feel that this is my fault, although it isnot.
It is just hell inside this mind of mine and growing worse by the day.
With those of us out here telling, yelling, being gentle, when the fuck do we get heard.
screw the rich and famous most of us are regular folks and our stories are important, i think but mainstream does not even those orgs that are supporedlly their for us.

As many of you know i have also fought my disease of alcoholism.
The program i joined taguht me to live one day at a time.
Taking things as they came and dealing with them without the use of my friend Jonhn Barleycorn.
Now I have a disease, Alzheimer's and Frontal Temporal Dementia, which have robbed me of those memories that i was told to keep green, so I would remember my life with JB and the hell that i lived in.
Those days and other memories good and bad are all becoming only words to me.
They are starting not to carry the pain, joy, saddness, hapiness , etc of my past.
Alzheimer's has now forced me to live in only the minute, not even the day, I can do something at 8am and by 8:30am it is gone, not even a memory only a few words exist about it.
This is becomming more and more my life.
Living only in the moment.
I guess that is how we are reallly to live, but this is new and confussing to me.
It is about 7pm here and I cannot tell you what I did an hour ago.This fuckin disease really robs you of things and it is taking more faster and faster.
But I still have 1/2 brain cell that refuses to give up, so I can tell you of this journey at least for the moment.
Take care of yourselves.

The last week or so has been less than wonderful, in fact I have lost most of it, every time i turnned around i was waking up.
Yesterday was the worse of them all.
I got a real look into the future so to say.
I was not doing well mentally and as I went downstatirs I think in the morning some time i just stopped on the landing.
I recall someone telling me to come down offf the statirs.
i think I remained their for I am not sure how long.
I know i was not sure where I was or who was talking to me and trembling, I think that is why i would not move.
because i was to unstable.
I got downstairs and wet to the refrigerator to get some soda to drink.
This lady was talking to me and asking me how I was and all that type of shit.
Finally I asked her who the fuck she was.
I think she said your wife Lynn, I just looked at her and nothing.
I wondered why she was in my house.
I left the kitchen and went and sat down.
I rememger being told what day it was by more than one person and that I seemed out of it.
Finally I recognized Lynn.
But the rest of the day was really messed up until late evening.
So now for the time being I have some knowing of what things are going to really be like first hand.
Physically i am having more and more trouble moving.
My conversation with others is getting more difficult and less, oh what the hell, speakable cannot think of the right wording.
That is becoming harder, finding the words that fit we play guessing games with me as to what I am trying to say, i guess i am refining my language, joenese, to a more pure form, which I do not undersstand.
Until next time be good to yourselves.
God Bless & Keep You & This Country of Ours!

<doc date=Saturday, January 28, 2012>
Of late some of you have yelled at me in emails and comments.
Apparantely my fire has gone somewhat.
Well you are right.
I hate ths fucking disease.
Alzheimer's is robbing me of who I was, i am constantly lost is a maze in my brain.
Lost in conversations, seems this is my only way of real contact.
I walk like a drunken sailor, my hands and feet hurt, my body trembles, i cannot see very well anymore.
I try to keep a sense of humor but it is becoming more difficult.
You all have a feeling of my thoughts towards the Alzheimer's Organization, well Mr. Robert Egge, VP of Public Policy wrote me and i am sure others to watch howdy doodies State of the Union for his push for NAPA and Alzheimer's because Obama cares deeply abouth this.
WELL gues what not a word or a whisper or passing comment about it.
Got another email from Egge stating disappointment but to wait for the buget and how we may shine.
These people have no clue, we with Alzheimer's are not important to this government and society at large.
I mean i get all these emails about this vitamin this herb and even coconut oil to help retartd the damange and help.
Horse feathers, this shit may work for a very, very, very few for a short time 6 mos to two years and then they hit a brick wall.
No more functionality, quaks go away.
ALZ a cure by 2025 not on a hot day in the summer.
Idiots do not even know what causes it.
Loook up the studies, tey all contradict one another.
I will say it agin, WE HOLD THE KEY, come to us for the answers, get the hell out of your little square boxes and see the reality.
People say Joe you are wrong, the prove it to me, show me the one person that has been cured or givn 5 to 6 more years of life because of the so called wonder drugs and herbs, etc.
All my friends that have taken this crap have deterorated and even died in the 8 year time line.
In 3 short years the seven of us is the Memory The Loss Tapes and 2 in the Caregiver Part of HBO Documentary The Alzheimer's Project, only TWO of us are alive today.
Yes my life sucks just like the others with this disease.
I want it over, i know what still lies ahead and it ain't the golden years.
Yes more people are speaking out, but they have money and prestige on careers so they are important.
The people in the know say there are over 5.4 million of us in the US, According to the American Health Assitance Foundation approx.
over 500,000 will join us in 2011.
Well now I bet there are over7-8 million in this country in this world of mine.
All those that are hidden and not talked about shoved into the darkness because this still is widely seen as mental illiness rather than the disease that it is.
I know organizations are getting out the word.
We do you people unite into one voice and let it be heard through out the land?
God Bless & Keep You & This Country of Our!

Before i give the link to this song, I want to answer Dana's question.
First no question that i am assked on this blog is to personal.
I have nothing to hide and wish to share all that i have.
I do not take Aricept, Namenda, or Exlon (or whaterver it is called) nore the other two drugs for Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia.
See I wrote all this dow so I could do this post and not use my 1/2 brain cell.
I did use the A&N drugs, however I got worse on them and suffered other sided affects, the nuerolgist that I went to, the best in California, told me to flush them and go on and enjooye the rest of the time I had left.
So I did.
2 other neurolgists feel the same.
I know some folks say they help, my issue is do they really or do theose at least some that take them think they do because that is what they were told.
Read the comple pharm reports on them and you will see that they are not sure if they will work.
The only medical advice if any that you will get here is talk to your doctor and make them talk with you not at you it is your body and your life.
So there!
Anyone no matter were they live in the wolrd can order my book on my side for the shippping only price.
Yes Karen it costs more than 6.95 for me to ship out of the states, but that is my contribution to get the word out.
Besides a paid a bundle to publish it, rich i will not get, my purpose is only to share this World with others.l Now for the link which has the credits for the song: The Greatest Alzheimer's Song Ever!
I hope you find the humor and truth in this song.
By the way I about fell out of my chair listening to it.
God Bless & Keep You & This County of Ours!

I have done my veyt best to fight this disease with all the mental strenght that I have had.
I have allowed it to take its tolll on me physically because my mind was more important and is who anaad what I am.
Well itt has marched on and I have not, it is to the point I look at those in my house and wonder who they are.
I know I sould know them but I do not.
I pretend to be in touch but well Mr. Alzheimer's has taken over and made him serlf at home.
I rarely hear from any friends or see them, I hardly hear from any of you anylonger.
There once was a time the commentss and emails were difficult to keep up with, now the emptiness of that is setting in.
I know everyoe has their proble,s and life to live, but the anger that this disease hels to raise, while not really justified, it happens and and this world of mine has grown smaller, colder, darker and emptier and really not worth being here, I pray and even beg to be taken, but it is in his time.
I have nothing more to offer or give and do not know why i am here.
Well i am loooosing my train of thought so take care of yourselves.

Very few people write about the experience of Alzheimer's as Joe does here.
My friend, also a caregiver, loaned me one such book, Alzheimer's from the Inside Out by Richard Taylor.
Dr. Taylor tells it like it is as does Joe.
Here are some quotes from his book: The fact is, most experts spend more time talking to and listening to caregivers than they do talking to and listening to those of us with dementia.
pp.
30, 31 Everyday, every hour, every few minutes, I lose my train of thought.
.
.
.
Conversations pass me by as I struggle to keep up, keep on track, and stay in the game.
p 65 Can I successfully live in a world where I am missing larger and larger chunks of what is going on around me?
p. 69 Time does not mean much to me now.
I do not know and seldom care if it is Monday or Wednesday or Sunday.
p. 119 I am not a child.
Even if sometimes I act like one, check me out--I AM NOT A CHILD!
.
.
.
there are times when I want to figure things out for myself.
pp.
190, 192 Care givers stress themselves as much or more than do the people for whom they care.
We can't be who you want or need us to be.
Don't get upset with us or yourself when we aren't.
Treat us as someone you love as we are, not who you wish we were or who you want and think we should be.
We don't intend to make you mad just being ourselves; we don't go out of our way to make you mad.
You push us to be as you are and we push back.
You push us to be as we were and we don't understand.
p. 209 I don't feel hopeless--I feel that to hope tomorrow will be better than today is a waste of time that diminishes my appreciation of today.
p. 219 I want to encourage, advocate, promote, and persuade you to think about being a "Best Friend" to the loved one in your life who has Alzheimer's disease.
p. 241 As Joe says, God bless you and this great land of ours.
Carol

Yes i am still here, unfortunately.
We now use pad on the bed, you know that song Old Man River he just keeps rolling on, well he does we and where he decideds to.Most of my momments are fuzzy now and fewer and fewer clear days.
One of our family (this means all of you) recently lost there love one to Alzheimer's.
I am still waiting for a picture name and birth date and date set free to post on memory page.
I guess it maybe to hard, believe she has been diagnosed with Alzheimer's or som form of dementia just recently what a bitch life can be.
Well i guess it is what it is.
Have read some new studies that contradict the last 100+ years of the possible cause of Alzheimers.
I need to post them for you all.
They kind of boost my ego what is ledft of it showing what my doctor and i felt was right that they had the wrong path basically.
Problem is I sit down to do thes things and forget why I am at my computer.My days consist of very little since i do not leave the house oftern and I sit down and the next thing you know i am waking pup hours later, i cn not control it I fall asleep while talkin even.
Ihave held my own for sometime nowbut the disease is doing its job and catchin me pretty fast now.
I am no longer sending emails to people who could help raise our voice and face to the public, they just do not care my feelings, i get back auto reply emails, wel when it strikes home I guess they will be some of the loudesss to yell, and never look back at the chance they had to hep raise our voices.i will be taking my book off of my site for free shortly nobody really seems to want it either, so sounds like i am on a pitty pot, i guess i am, i have fought and fought and yelled been nice even9that took courage) and still nothing so you will only hear fom now on as i cn remember to let ou know how life is.
Thank all of you for being there for me.

Coconut oil.
I have been trying it with my husband for two years.
Dr. Mary Newport has just released her book ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE: What If There Was a Cure?
The Story of Ketones.
Now the Alzheimer's Association and other folks have tried to quiet her and her claims for coconut oil.
But in my experience with my husband and that of the author, it does help the quality of life.
Check it out!
Her recipe for coconut fudge is worth the price of the book.

Those of you who care for us with Alzheimer's konw how difficult we can be .
We can get damn angery and quiet uncontrollable at times.
I know I can get really confrontaitional to the point of physical violence and those around me knwo when to back away quickly and let me be.
This is not really funny at all but I have to show you a video my daughter took of my getting out of hand.
Before Viewing You may want to go down on the right and turn off the music.
As you can see they keep me well under control.
to get the full affect of this you will need your speakers turned up.Again I am not making fun of this part of the disease but am trying to handle it in a funny sort of manner, be pissed, angry or upset with me, I have to deal with this.
As physically I am moving quickly to the later stages, my mind is starting to follow to fast but i will laugh as long as i can.

From Alzheimer's Disease ResearchOctober 17, 2011University at Buffalo scientists have discovered a tiny piece of a critical receptor that fuels the brain as a promising new drug target for Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases.
"This is the first time that this site has been shown to be useful as a drug target," says Gabriela K. Popescu, Ph.D., associate professor of biochemistry in UB's School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences and senior author on the study.
The research on the NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor was published online October 11 in Nature Communications.
"If we could find a drug that attaches itself to this site and locks together NMDA receptor subunits, that would be huge for fighting disability from stroke, Alzheimer's, and other neurodegenerative diseases," Popescu said.The research focuses on the brain's receptors for the neurotransmitter, glutamate, which is implicated in these diseases as well as in other conditions, such as glaucoma.
The two main glutamate receptors in the brain are NMDA and AMPA receptors, both of which play critical roles in human learning and memory.
Both types of receptors are made of four subunits and within each receptor these subunits are organized in pairs called dimers.Because these receptors are similar in structure, scientists had assumed that they function in much the same way.
"But when we altered the dimer interface, the site where two subunits come together within each pair, we found that the NMDA receptor works just the opposite of the way that the AMPA receptor works," Popescu said.
"Cementing this interface in AMPA receptors leads to more activity, whereas we found just the opposite to be true in NMDA receptors.
"By locking the subunits together, the UB researchers were able to achieve a marked reduction in NMDA activity and, subsequently, a marked reduction in the amount of calcium that enters neurons in response to the neurotransmitter glutamate.
Calcium overload due to overactive NMDA receptors is what eventually kills off neurons, Popescu said, leading to the symptoms that occur after a stroke, and in Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases.
"The fact that by cross-linking the subunits, we could so dramatically reduce NMDA receptor activation demonstrates, for the first time, the tantalizing possibility that we may be able to develop new therapies that can much more effectively treat, or even one day prevent, some of these devastating diseases, like Alzheimer's and stroke," Popescu says.And, because each type of NMDA receptor has a slightly different dimer interface, Popescu says, this finding represents a new opportunity for rationally designing drugs that would preferentially inhibit only a select population of NMDA receptors in the brain, thus reducing the possibility of side effects.Currently, the Alzheimer's drug called Namenda, one of the only existing pharmaceuticals that inhibit the NMDA receptor, targets a different site within the receptor.
"If a new drug could be developed to target the dimer interface, which we discovered to be inhibitory, it would allow more specific effects than current drugs," Popescu said.
"That's because at this particular interface, the interactions between these subunit interfaces are more precise than those currently being targeted.

I hvae not written lately because I have not been able to.
To this point i have only really suffered some of the affects mentallly of the disease and the physical has gotten worse.
Back brace, a scootter chair now, tremors higher dosages of meds for pain and to keep me somewhat calm.
Now i ned the wrife to help me use the remote of all fricken things.
I still sit at the dinner table and am not sure what I am doing, i am getting lost more and more in conversations.
Hell i am starting to gorget to turn this thing on let alone post.
I keep getting sites from people tat want posted on here, but i have to read them and ask Lynn if they fit, i owe that to you my family.
Some I have just forgotten this is not a sales site, with once acception MY BOOK.
then the money is doneated.
I am lucky these days that I can stay awake for part of the day, i just drift and that is that for hours.
I am getting to know less and less where I am and actually what I am doing.
Guess it is true some of us stay mentally ok until we start to reach the end of this disease.
Then all of a sudden down the hill lickety split and it is over.
Not only have most of those in the documentary Memory the loss tapes left us, but a number of those is the other parts that were featured with Alzheimer's have passed since the release in 2009 I think it was.
Still I hear no voices for us, only those inside my head now, but they have interesting things to say and they agree with me msot of the time, sometimes they get out of hand.
Till next time you take care of your selves.

I was reading best I coudl an artickle in AARP to day called: Diagnosing Alzheimer's by Katharine Greider.
Interesting a lot about nothing, they know they have no tests or real meds to help us, gosh what a fricken surprise.
A Quote; "But scientists don't yet understand exactly what various results of biomarker tests mean for each patient or how they can be used to predict a patient's future.
(i typed this from the article.)"
Eli Lilly has a drugg Amyvid which is an injectible radioactive dye to stain amyloid deposits for use in PET Scans which may help.
quote from article: "The drugmaker says Amyvid would be for old people with mental decline wose diagnosis is uncertain."
you judge that one.
This is the best part of the article and only part that is truly reaal in my opinion.
"It will likely be many years before any test can predict precisely who really with get the disease, and when," says Frances, who has helped establish guidelines to iagnose mental disorders.
"In the meantime, there will be lots of continued hype about progress in testing," hes says.
"The best thing mos people can do is simply ignore it.
Instead of worrying about Alzheimer's you should make sure to exercise you mind and body, eat well, don't drink too much, and enjoy life."
Exactly waht my neuroligist a number of years ago said to me, except she said dump the meds they are not going to stop anything.
Keeep my shrink so he coulc give me the mental calming drugs and mode stabilizers I would need.
And enjoy the time I had left.
Now to those who keep telling me just because you forget placing your glasses, keys, appointments, pens, etc.
does not mean you have Alzheimer's.
CORRECT, but when you do all these things daily, you have a fricken problem, bub.
I am now entering year 7 and the physciall parts are taking hold, no balance, bladder wants to be on self control, forgetting my meds, needing to hold the walls to walk, back brace so I am not in pain, meds increased to help with symptoms, may even have my ow Scooter Chair soon to I can go shopping and not die in the middle of the store, because I am in pain cannot walk, people just need to disapear, sweating getting confused (some fun).
I truly hate it when people tell me hang in there it will be ok. Fuck it will not be ok I am dieing.
That is ok, this is just not the way i planned things.
Well till next time take care of yourselves.

Well after flunking my 2 hour glucose test with colors, we now have more blood tests we are waiting on, seems Alzheimer's and Frontal Temporal Dementia are not enough to have.
We alll konw i cannot spell.
have lost many brain cells.
I am Bi Polar, I have toooooo much body, now I have Type II Diabetes, Yeah team more fricken meds.
The Sleep DR. that did my sleep tests, has me scheduled for pulmenary tests thinks I might have COPD yeah, I will live to be 112 now, thanks a lot.
You will love this, I have a motorized cushion to help get my well developed body off the couch into a standing position, yes modern technology to my aid.
Still working on the wife to put an elevator in but boy she is stubborn.
I get brain fades now, use to call them brain farts, but then they only lasted a few seconds, these last longer thanb I can remember having them.
I was fitted for a back brace to day because I have shrunk almost to grasshopper hieght, have spinal spinousious or something along those lines.
The Golden Years that is what they call this, well I am on a hunt for the person that came up with that phrase, I intened to Golden Years all over that person.
At least I have all my body parts, some do not work right, but they are still there.
Have all my own teeeth, ok some have crowns, but underneath the construction it is my tooth.
I am lucky i still have my sense of humor good or bad (mostly bad) and still can talk with you my family.
There are many with Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia that cannot or will not speak out, and that is ok. Because all of us with this disease will be set free each in our own time from this life.
I for one can hardly wait.
Well you all be good, if not just do not name it after me.

Yesterday when I was younger, i wnt and had a large amount of blood taken for tests.
Now I am a child of the night seeking out dinner.
I had a two hour glucose toleratnce test, WOW.
I was hungry as hell then they gave me the water to drink, filled with what tasted like sugar, but I am not sure what was in it.
Well now I felt fine, they drew my blood at one hour and the world was ok, at the seceond and final hour the world was a bit different.
I felt like i was as drunk as a skunk I could not walk without help.
Funny how the floors and walls move by themselves.
I truly was wasted have not felt like that in decades, nor do I want to again.
Should get results within the week.
Had to wait until today to catch you all up, yesterday just was a RUSH all day, no one wanted to leave me but everyone had to go somewhere, I ate alot and slept and by late evening I was in better shape.
Today is ok, i just hurt all over, feel like i was used as a punching bag, i am big enoungh and well stuffed.
I still wonder why this disease is not working the same with me as others, it seems all the physical parts are rapidly come down, but although not fully functional, my brain seems to be somewhat alive.
I do have problems doing complicated things, this is one of them, but there are times that things seem crystal clear, then they go to hell in a hand basket.
Really drives me nuts.
But Lynn in her loving and gentle way reminded me today that I never do anything the way I am suppose to.
Marriage what a wonderful thing.
Try it you may like it, I tried three times, until I was taught how to behave myself.
Stay well and take care of yourselves.
Love You All!
God Bless & Keep You & This Country of Ours!

I think the world knows what took place this day and I do not need to tell you.
What has gotten me of late are the emails telling me to Remember The Flag.
To fly it today.
See these are the folks that go to church on the holidays only.
I am an American, my Flag flies 365 days a year day and night (it is lit for the night).
I have flown the Flag for over 20+ years on my home.
This is my heritage the 200+ years of this Country.
I pray for all those who put their lives on the line daily for all of us World Wide so we can live free.
Enough of the soap box, my days have been crapy lately, i am getting fitted for mobility movers so I can go out with the family.
Also to help get my fat ass off the couch, you know a cushion that liftss you up gentteling and puts you in a standing position.
Yes my mind still for some reason still works, but the physical parts of Alzheimrer's are rapiddlly taking over.
Brain wanders a lot.
For the most part I stay in, sleep at the drop of a hat, watch my fish clean their ponds, which just wears me out.
Still get lost in the days though.
Just like trying to post here, i sit down and just starrte at the screen and forget what the hell i am doing here.
Oh well at least i still remember to breathe.
You all bne good to yourselves and stay well.
God Bless & Keep You & This Country of Ours!
joe PS the blessing includes all of you World Wide.

I have a challenge for all of you.
GET MY BOOK FREE, just pay shipping and hanlding hell it is even signed, except the digital copy.
After the cost of mailing the rest goes to Alzheimer's Disease Reseaarch Foundation.
I get nothing, even on the sales my royalties go to them.
You reall want to help well here is an eay way.
You can even give the book to friends to view and follow.
Only have about 5 hard backs, about 75 siftcovers, but can sen ou a hell of alot of digital copies.
Yes I am assking for you to put you money to wor.
This book cost me thousands of dollars to get published, i never expected to get rich or my money back, let alone sell more than 2 or 3 books.
Well giving them away and my royallties will never pay for the printing, have sold more than 3 though.
Those in other countries i still charge what is on the list, although it cost not only the shipping you pay, but double thatn.
So you money does not get donated since i go in th whole on it.

Yes I have Alzheimer's and Sleep Apnea seems to go with it.
I was first diagnosed back in the mid 1990s, remember the old times.
Had my test again, well now what took place, well went for my findingss or whatever want to call them, appiontment was for 10:30AM as usual had the normal 15 min.
delay, that turned to 30 mins.
at whch time the wifey got involved as to what was going on, well 45 min after my appt.
time taken back had blood pressure, which was rissing, taken and my wieght.
Seated right in front of the Dr. office and told it would be about 2 mins.
and I was next.
Well, he comes out and takes in three people who needed an interpeter ahead on me.
Now you all know the high esteeenm i hold the medical field in, so you can guess what took place, the Dr. was told directly what I thought and so was his entire staff and all the patients heard, you know i hold nothing back.
Well with contrite voice and approach the ass called me later in the day and was so apppologitic that I wanted to vomit.
I still gave him no respect or quarter.
Apparently my SA is not very bad, so time will tell on the front.
Early Onset Alzheimer's diagnosis is a MYTH it does not exist people.
Only if they tell you 10 or so years before.
One of our family members (part of this family on the blog), husband was diagnosed with EOA from reading her blog and things it seems to me to be about a year ago.
He is now in mid stage, gee from EOA to mid stage in 1 to 2 years no way.
We are generally diagnosed in mid stage, because the HealthCare providers do not want to TAG us as one of THOSE people.
But if you have cancer, aids, heart disease, herpes, well yeah we can tell you normal folks get those diseases.What I am trying to say in the stage play here, is we are still not to be talked about and I see and hear it all the time.
Everything is to help the caregiver, Time To Listen To Us, we hold the key let us give it to you.
Are we not people, do we not cry, do we not feel pain, do we not feel the frustrations of loosing our memories and control over our bodies?
Bet your sweet ass we do and are.
I take 80mg of Fluoxetine (prozac) a day to handle my mood shifts and anger, also take 20mg of Crestor to manage my cholesterol ( diet and exercise has never worked, liver is to efficient at producing this little bugger), 300mg of Gambapentin (Neroutin) to manage moods, seizures and the neropathy that I have so I can walk and feel in my hands, take .5mg of Cholozapam (Kolonipin) twice daily to help with my St. Vidas Dance, the tremors and shakes probably will be increased because it helps with sleep temmors and REM Behavoral Disorder.
None of the so called slow the process drugs, sorry tried no help and most people I know have gotten no real benefit from them.
Have hadt tow reallly top neurologists say no to them because they have not seen them help anyone in their practices.
You know the drugs, Aricept, Namenda, Exerol and the rest.
I have written I believe in past posts about these drugs.
Well this is a lot for me, I feel like I am preaching, probably I am and it is to the choir, no one that counts is listening, you all know this is not directed at you.
God Bless & Keep You & This Country Of Ours!

Yes aliens came and got me and did wierd things to me.
I loved it.
Wired for the night and sleep test should get results on next earth visit.
My doctor says that in his practice in sleep studies that he has found that sleep apnea is a precursor to different forms of Dementia, including Alzheimer's.
This i find interesting and have looked into this and their seems to be some validaty to this thought process.
To all that have bought my book thank you, I am sure the Alzheimer's Disease Research Foundation appreciates you also.
All funds I receive from my book are donated to them.
I will be posting the new amount shortly.
I cannot thank you all enough for helping to find the cause.
I was on the Natioanal NAPA Alzheimers Comference call on the 5th i think it was.
Have to say i was less than impressed.
Most callers  (practically all) just wiened about there not being financial help for them to take care of THESE PEOPLE almost all used that terem.
I think i said it before if not i will say it now, we who suffer this disease are just to be put off to the side.
I am one of THESE people and deserve more thought than we are given.
Only two ladies had any brains on that call, as far as i am concerned.
They both spoke about their mothers getting Alzheimer's in their late 40's and early 50's and dieing within 5 years.
They feel and I agree whole heartedly with them that the studies should not be for onlyl those 65 and older,  THEY (yes thos who know it all) have to realize that this disease starts much sooner than 65, I knew at 50 something was wrong but it took years to get any health provider to really listen.
I was asked what I wanted to say off the air, you know the screening process, and I told them we need a voice and as i continued, you guess click and back to toe conference, that just depens my distaste for ALZ.org, and many of you know I do not hold them dearly at all.
Will let you all know the outcome of my alien abduction and expierements after they return on Monday to talk to me again.

Why this topic?
Well today I found out that I suffer from REM Behavioral Disorder and have for sometime, years.
I am undergoing sleep study this Wednesday to find out how far it has progressed along with my sleep apnea and other stuff.
Found out today that this disorder has long been shown to be a precusor to dementia.
My sleep Dr. is excited to make the study because it is not often he gets to deal with this.
What is it?
Well apparently when i enter the REM stage of sleep i do a lot of twitching, jerking and as it progresses I get violent in my sleep.
Poor Lynn has been the bearer of this action.
However she has most of the time feels things starting and gets to me before, yes I start beating on anything in the bed including her.
This is apparently what also helped me out of bed and on to the floor.
So if you know anyone with this disorder maybe they should start talking now to a medical professional that has ears and maybe able to save them some rotten years ahead.
Alzheimer's and Frontal Temporal Dementia, have for runners apparently not just shrinkage, amaloyids and stroke or damage.
Have not seen any studies that I have found that show much about sleep disorders and dementia, really.
They have touched on it, but I am not sure they have done any real serious in depth looking at the connection.
They probably fall asleep anyway.
Also found out today that my stature in life has shortened by 21/4", yes i have shrunk from a towering 5'83/4" to a colosal 5' 61/2" inches.
This i attribute to my kids they made me old, grey, short and fat.
Till next time take care.

As many of you know i get rather testy at times and just fell like saying to hell with it, you do not need to know this or how I feel.
Then i get an email like the one tha follows, this is why I keep trying to give us a voice.
Parts are edited since it came to my private email so no name of way to tell who it is from.
But i did write back to the person, took me a short time then longer.
I asked for a pic and name and dates for my memory page, but like soooooo many of you i receive nothin back.
I post the pics so people will know that these folks lived, they gave, they touch others lives and that should be celebrated.
well to the email i am getting on my soap opera box.
by the way this has been on my todo list for sometime, i am quick.I was asked if i filled out the facebook form, YOU BET YOUR SWEET A__, I did.
____________________________________________________________________ Hello, My name is xxxxxx, and I'm a nursing student studying in xxxxxxxxxx, xxxxxx (Canada).
I watched The Alzheimer's Project documentary, and was very touched by your story.
I know you have probably heard this from so many other people who have read your story online, or watched this same documentary, but I would like to thank you so much for contributing your own experiences and stories to helping understand and find a cure for Alzheimer's.
I was asked to write an essay for one of my courses at school on anything I wanted related to disease and disease concepts.
I chose Alzheimer's because my grandfather passed away from A.D. 10 years ago.
I never had the chance to really get to know him, since his diagnosis occurred when I was only 2 years old.
By the time I was old enough to have memories of my own, he had already progressed to the very late stages of the disease.
He only spoke Italian, which I did not, thus I had very limited communication with him.
My memories with this man consist of visiting him at the nursing home, where he stared at me with blank eyes.
I fed him and walked him around, and told him stories.
When he passed away, I felt like a part of me had been ripped out of my chest, and it was difficult to accept that I had not known him better, and could do nothing about that.
I appreciate hearing from someone who can recount his own experiences with this disease.
I do not have personal experience with this disease, and was only an observer to something that took away someone I loved.
However, I believe that it takes great strength to explain what it feels like to go through something that takes away from the person you have grown to become.
I do not know what has happened to you or your family, or if you crosses "the line" since the documentary was filmed.
I would only like to thank you, quite simply, for giving me a story that my grandfather never was able to.
So thank you, truly, from the bottom of my heart.
God Bless & Keep You & This Country of Ours!

The following is an email I received, we who suffer are being finally a real chance to speak out, i have submitttted the form, this could very well put a face and a real voice to this disease.
I ask you to join me.
My name is Ashmi, and I'm on the Facebook Marketing team.
I love your blog.
For Alzheimer's Awareness month in September, we are partnering with the  Alzheimer's Association to help raise awareness.
We're collecting stories on the theme of how people with Alzheimer's use  Facebook to find strength and cope- through knowing that treasured memories,  photos, and conversations are preserved on Facebook.
We're trying to raise  awareness about how people who are suffering can learn about coping with  Alzheimer's in the modern day - perhaps through Facebook as a place to revisit  and secure those memories and identities.
If you are interested in sharing your story with us on this topic, please let me  know.
We'd love to raise awareness about Alzheimer's.
I created an online form  where you can tell your story: http://www.jotform.com/form/11850317172.
Please let me know,  Ashmi  God Bless & Keep You & This Country of Ours!!

Well it has been awhile since last i was here.
Things in my world are getting very disarrayed.
I find i cannot even be sure of what time it is each day or exacty what i am doing.
Alzheimer's is working hard and i am still being stubborn but it is winning this battle, in the end i win.
Mly head hurts alot these days and i do not know why asprins do not help it just feels like someone or thingh is n my head squeexing everything together.
Well maybe that is good, keeps my brain cesll together.
I am finding it more difficult to post or even to figure out why i am at the compute most days.
I sit and stare at it alot but it does not say anuthing to me, damned thing.
I am totallly lost on the days now and even almost completely unaware of when someone is or is not in the house, i think they have just gone and they just got home or never left.
Very frustrating and i do not even want to think about it which has be a bit miffed over things.
i am rambling time to go be good to yoursleves.

In this world that i now live in has very few gifts in it, mostly all crud.
Many of you know about my KOI pond and all the pain in building it and loooosing my two prize KOI, so you think of all the crap and hoow your life is leaving quickly.
Yesterday we had to tear the pond apart and give it a complete cleaning and water change and redo plants and trimig of plants and all the pain in the buttt things it takes to get this done.
I do not move quickly so it takes quite awhile to get things done.
Well as things would be we took the waterfall apart and in the lower seperate pond to the main in among the Parrott Feather was a poor little hummingbird just water logged.
Poor thing must have wieghed at least twoo hundred pounds with the water.
It jumped on the ledge then to the ground, I put my hand down, here is the gift I got and share with you: This little buddy, just jumped up onto my hand and sat there.
Every so offten he fluttered his wings trying to dry off and held my finger tightly with its' tiny little feet.
He stayed with me for about ten minutes, while he dried out and then finally got enough lift went stod still for a second and as he looked and took off you kind of hear him squeak and left like a missle.
Enjoy as I did.

Today has not ben good so far.
Have beeen trying to write this for sometime.
My brain is somewher but not with me.
My body feels like a train hit it and my head hurts like hell.
It took me 3 fricken hours to dry the towels, see I was air fluffing them, not drying.
Eyes do not see things right either.
We will be doing the videos but probably will have someone edit out what Lynn does not want shown, me I give a fuck.
But she rules the roost.
I was talking with Lyn the other day and told her that it is feeling like we are now in diffferent worlds.
I see her and others, but I cannot feel them or their presence in mly world.
I feel like I am seperating away from things.
Then suddenly everthing crashes back together and hell I do not know what is going on.
All I think I know is that things are getting squirelly in this world of mine.
Reaching out does not work I cannot get beyond the barrier anymore, time is becoming my enemy with things.
Enough I hurt tooooo much right now.

I have a decession to make and i am asking you to help me with this.
Now i know many of you do not leave comments or only once in awhile, i have found that person anonymous on my site, you know the one that tells the media something or politicians heard it from.
But however you chooose to answer please do.
Some of you may remember the short clip in my tiny part of The Alzheimer's Project, where me and my phycologist were talking, he was the good looking young guy with the nice hair.We met the other day, yes i still see him, the poor guy needs help with his car payments.
He is very aware of my blog, the documentary, my book and the number of people you have helped me reach.
If you use the resources on the side and go from one to the other and use there resources you will eventually reach over 1200 sites for caregivers, information on various forms of dementia, different blogs of those suffering, charities and the rest, all because of suggestions you have passed on to me.
Here is the skinny as they say, whoever they are, Dr. Cain has suggested tapping my sessions now that thingss are going to hell in a hand basket and posting them on my blog.
I can post them there or to my You Tube account.
You all know i hold nothing back and some of ours sessions are alot livelier and wordy then my posts.
He has no problem with it, i have no problem with it, Lynn is undecided at this thime.
We are thinking it will give a better face to the disease not just words, but you get to see my Bright Shinning Face and drool I know it is tough being me.
But you couls start to see the true reality of this bastardly disease.
YOUR COMMENTS AND THOUGHTS PLEASE!

Joe, this is to put a smile to your face.
It came to my e-mail.
A little silver-haired lady calls her neighbor and says, "Please come over here and help me.
I have a killer jigsaw puzzle, and I can't figure out how to get started."
Her neighbor asks, "What is it supposed to be when it's finished?"
The little silver haired lady says, "According to the picture on the box, it's a rooster."
Her neighbor decides to go over and help with the puzzle.
She lets him in and shows him where she has the puzzle spread all over the table.
He studies the pieces for a moment, then looks at the box, then turns to her and says,  "First of all, no matter what we do, we're not going to be able to assemble these pieces into anything resembling a rooster."
He takes her hand and says, "Secondly, I want you to relax.
Let's have a nice cup of tea, and then,"  he said with a deep sigh ............  "Let's put all the Corn Flakes back in the box."

I have not talked much about me lately, been trying to give you other info.
But this blog is about my journey into neverland.
Yes it is a voygae to places I do not know and people that look familar but yet are strangers.
I have been pretty lucky so far, but that is runnning out, the physical affects, my emotions and mental status are starting to change rapidly for me.
Lynn has to wakee me up because I fall asleep while eating.
I just stop in the middle of things, I sleep at the drop of a leaf and i forget what the hell i am talking about.
My hearing is gettting worse, it never has been perfect, but the words I hear from people are becooming completly diferrent from what they are saying.
Mornings use to be fine for me, not anymore, I get up still around 8am and out of bed, feed the she devil bird, my attack fish, take my meds hopefully, that all takes maybe an hour.
And there I am sound asleep on the couch by 9:30 or so and completely unaware really of things until after noon.
Not that i become a mental genius suddenly but the fog clears for awhil not long anymore.
I guess the 8 year path is right i am now in about year 6 or so and things are going away from me or I am going away.
Not sure anymore.
But you folks have been a blessing in my Life.
The Alzheimer's and Frontal Temporal Dementia are doing there job and getting much better at it.
To all that bought my book Thank You, your money that I received has mostly been donated to The Alzheimer's Research Foundation.
so much for today, you all take care of yourselves.

Dear Peter, Thank you for the years of Columbo and many other movies that you so entertained us in.
You will always be remember for that wonderfully prestine kept car, your Gentlemen's Q dress and your mild manner of investigating.
Yes I was a fan.
You are now free from this bastardly disease, yes I am jealous I am still awaiting my freedom.
Only wish that you and your family would have choosen to go public loud and clear and beat the drum loudly for all of us that suffer.
You could have done so much for us.
I know it is hard to let people know, but our closet needs to be smashed so that folks know there are real faces and voices behind this disease.
But rest in peace now and enjoy your freedom, walk with the Lord my friend Peter.

Yes country singer star and legend as they say GLEN CAMPBELL has joined our ranks.
It was announced sometime yesterday I think, that he is in the early stages, we know that means more like the mid, since they have no idea of what early onset really is.
I for one am sorry that he has it, but on the other hand I welcome him to Our World with Joy.
See he is a star a person of importance, so I am sure he will start to get a lot a press about it and talked to.
But whatreally pisses me off is why it was announced: According to the news media Mrs. Campbell and Glen wanted to go public about it, now get this, SO THAT IF HE HAS TROUBLE ON STAGE HIS FANS WILL UNDERSTAND!
Sorry folks i have said it before and will say it again money is what talks period.
I am a fan of his and like his music, but sorry reason is way off base and bullshit.
My Opinion.
Just think how the rest of us are treated and regonized and the differrent treatment he will get.

Crap ass month so far, as some of you may have read my niece died a week or so ago and last week sometimme i lost my two prize KOI and then i am told I have orthostatic tremors, never say what the hellll else will happen.
Many of you know I was honrod to share the silver screen with six other lovely people in the HBO special, The Alzheimer's Project, Memory the Loss Tapes.
I considered us, although i never said anything as The Magnificant Seven.
Well Ms. Fannie Davis has passed on,I was advised today, i still need to get her pic and dates and anothers up on my Memorial Page.
I am glad to tell you that as of this afternoon Ms. Yolanda Sanmartino (the womaninthe mirror) is still kicking and doing well at Cherrywood Nursing Home.
Just the two of us left, seems though we are all staying in the 8 or so year time line.
My book has made it to Europe, hopefully it will help someone over there.It humbles a pain in the ass like me that my blog, my story and my book have gotten so much attention world wide.

Well i decided to do as my Dr. requested i went and saw a neurologist today.
Met one with some brains actually, she feels that the meds they have for us are really of no value, she has yet to see them help anyone.
Smart lady.
She has determined after trying to kill me that I have orthostatic tremors.
The meds i am on are supposed to help these, right, we have added one to the list, we will see.
However she referred me to another of her spieces  that is supposed to have this as their specialty.
We went over my PET scan that i had had and finally got a real discriptive  telling of my brain, it showed considerable damage, loss or destruction if you will to both side temporal lobes and the frontal, and other abnomalities.
Of course she did not know the other abs is my most wonderful sense of humor, did not have the heart to tell her.
As she did those reflect tests, it sounded like she was beating on cement on my knees.
did not do well on rest of the things, but that is the way it is.
Her only thoughts at this time to help me to stop shake rattle and rolling, is the possibility of DEEP BRAIN STIMULATION!!!!!!
Who knows what monsters that might awake.
Oh well we will see what her cohort has to say.

I am becomming more confused eac day.
I sit here to write and just draw a complete blank.
I feel that thi journey is getting rather rocky and bumpy now.
When i started this blog, which seems like centuries to me, i was filled with a fire and a passion that was overwhelming me.
You all know how i feel that we who suffer from Alzheimer's, Lewy Bodies, Parkinsons, Frontal Temproal Dementia, Vascular, etc.
do no have a voice for us, i still feel that way, i do not want some so called expert, caregiver, reasearcher, etc.
speaking for me and telling how terrrible this is and the problems and heartbreat they feel caring for us.
Hell that does not put a voice or a face to us, to u yes, us no.
Like it or not, WE hold the key to this disease.
We have the answer, not you, we live it, why are we not asked, why are we not the experts, why is it not us that talks to the media and the big stars to tell the story?
You do not know this side at all.
When it started for me it was small slices of my life taken each day, those slices have grown steadily until they are now steak size.
The passion is still there to tell the story, but the fire is just a glow now.
I feel like i am talking to me on my left side, i am deaf in my left ear, i feel like my blog has lost it's thunder and no longer reaches out and is heard.
Yes i hear from folks once and awhile but not much anymore, I cannot begin to tell you how lonely it is inside my mind what is left now.
I cannot realy even talk about things much anymore.
Hell the fire and fuck the world attitude  has tempered down, I am understanding how the others that were in the hbo documentaroy felt and relate lmore to the world they became to know.
My niece died thursday, she was in her forties, i feel for her husband and three sons, but more for her mother and father, see we are to die before our children not out live them.
This is becomming way to much, there are things i want to do, but i forget them or just plain have no motivation to do them.
I rarely sit by my ponds any more, my interests seem to becoming less daily about anything.
Well until i remember you are out there again take care of yourselves.
God Bless & Keep You & This Country of Ours!

Gingrich to Alzheimer's Association Advocacy Forum attendees: "We should be able to come together to address Alzheimer's"May 16, 2011Former Speaker of the House and Alzheimer's Study Group Co-Chair Newt Gingrich addressed more than 600 advocates to begin the second day of the Alzheimer's Association Advocacy Forum.
Throughout his hour-long remarks, Gingrich encouraged advocates to speak out and share their experiences with elected officials.
"The Constitution says, 'We the people,' not 'We the legislators,''" said Gingrich.
"One of my goals here today is to assure you that you have every right and responsibility to go out and tell elected officials what is going on.
You are the living embodiment of the Alzheimer's issue."
Gingrich emphasized several themes, including the ongoing need for bipartisan support of the fight against Alzheimer's -- an issue he embraced when serving as co-chair of the non-partisan Alzheimer's Disease Study Group (ASG) with former Nebraska Senator Bob Kerrey.
'Alzheimer's should be a totally bipartisan issue," said Gingrich.
"Alzheimer's does not just affect Republicans or Democrats, liberals or conservatives.
It affects Americans.
Therefore, as Americans, we should be able to come together with no partisanship to address Alzheimer's."
Gingrich highlighted the high financial cost of Alzheimer's disease to Americans both now and in the future.
He emphasized the need for investment in Alzheimer's research -- and the potential cost savings if methods of treatment or prevention could be realized.
"Between now and 2050, Alzheimer's will cost the American government an estimated $20 trillion," said Gingrich.
"Yet today, Alzheimer's research is grotesquely underfunded.
We need the scientific community to tell us the optimum they could invest in the next 10 to 15 years.
What could they do if they had the resources they needed to save lives and save money?"
To conclude his remarks, Gingrich shared his overall optimism that the dream of a breakthrough in Alzheimer's research and awareness is on the horizon.
"I've seen things change," he said.
"Every generation of Americans has been allowed to dream, and every generation has seen some of their dreams come true."
Following a brief question and answer period, advocates left with much to discuss.
"Anyone who is standing up and advocating, I respect," said Suzette Armijo, an Alzheimer's ambassador from Mesa, Ariz. "He understands the impact of this disease.
He has big dreams and broad ideals when it comes to this issue.
It shows us as advocates that there are people on Capitol Hill who have those feelings.
It gives us hope."

Newsthis is great for HIV sufferers, would it not be nice if the medical community did something for our over 100+ year discovered disease.

Last week or so I had my annual physical, they are just a gas.
Found out that I have blood, burned off some basil cell carsanomas, weight loss program, now the doc wants me to see a neurologist, just because my balance is that of a rolly polly bottom doll.
The tremors and shakes are worse, have to hold the wall to walk right, had me place one foot in front of the other, sounds like a song, heel to toes and well like the gizallel that i am i almost fell.
I have yet to contact one, what are they going to tell me I am unbalanced, hell i already know that.
It will mean more tests, with or without and definitive answers and then a guess as to what meds i should get for it.
When i drank i had no problem with falling, i just fell and got up no big deal.
Now it seems to be a problem for others, just because one minute i am up and the next flat on my ass, so what, i am safer sitting anyways.
Lynn has gone back to work, no i am not alone, because people want to be paid, can you imagine such greed.
I really do not like that she is not here.
But i guess it is what it is.
We have discussed her executing absolute power of attorney which we made awhile ago.
I know longer trust my expert financial abilities, shit cannot even balance the check book right.
Once upon atime i could do it in my head, now the blasted calculator cann't even get it right.
Oh well life goes on.

I can hear you all now, joe is going on the rampage with this one.
Well you are wrong.
You all know the crap side and so do I, but you do not know the, morbid as it sounds, the blessings that come with this death sentence.
1.
You know you are not nuts.
2.
Death is no longer a fear.
3.
You get to forget your resentments.
4.
You no longer hate someone, because you forget them.
5.
You meet new people daily.
6.
You talk to stangers more frequently.
7.
You do not have to be stylish in your dressing any longer.
8.
You forget to tell people to fuck themselves, hence you may not swear as often.
9.
If you smoke you make forget to or where you placed the things, spend all day looking for them and go to bed saying the hell with it, and never having smoked.
10.
Nine could work for drinking.
11.
Wake up each morning with a new woman or man in your bed, This One We All Like, even you.
12.
Forget you annoying relatives and neighbors.
13.
Forget to turn on the TV, but yet you watch it.
14.
Have conversations with people who know what you are saying, but no one else can see them.
15.
Forget you hate vegetables and even try them now.
16.
Get to have some one else change your clothes, what fun that coould be.
17.
Take a bath when you damned well feel like or think you may need one.
18.
Won't discuss the toliet training that you forgot, you caregivers might not find that so enjoyable.
19.
Your new eating habits that help you loose wieght, no 20.00 for 20lbs., you just forget what food is for.
20.
One day the World and all of its' Bullshit suddenly stop for you.
See we have to look at the bright side once and awhile.
So I am sick, I am allowed, brain confussion, cannot seem to find the darn thing.
Have fun, be good to yourselves.

This is actuaaly about denial this post.
I read on caregiver sites, other blogs and comments on mine, "how do I get mom or dad to admit they have Alzheimer's, they are in denial".
Well my point of view, you just don't.
What is the big deal if they say Yes dam it I have Alzheimer's.
Does that validate YOU in some way.
Frick they know something is wrong, wake up.
Your job as their caregiver is TO BE THEIR FOR THEM, not to make them agree to having Alzheimer's.
We know we have a problem and it will get worse.
Yes I am yelling at you.
Imagine yourself being handed a DEATH SENTENCE, that is what Alzheimer's is.
Would You go around skipping down the street saying oh goody I have Alzheimer's; or do you think you just might keep your mouth shut and go about your business the best you could?
That is what I choose to do and many folks that I know that have the disease have choosen to do.
But I tell you on this blog what is happening to me so you get some insight into our world of frustration, terror and brain fog.
I do not know how everyone feels, but i do not consider myself any more important than anyone else with this disease, we walk together.
Forget whether your patient, loved one, etc.
accepts or talks about having Alzheimer's.
They have it, is not that enough said?
Help them do not hoover and smother them, be there and not in their face.
As you can tell this denial shit getss to me, because I wonder who really is in denial, the person with the disease or the person saying that one is in denial.
Enough of my ranting.

The Association also announced partnership with AIM (Alzheimer's Impact Movement).
Go to AIM and you can find out how legislatures in your state voted on our issues.

As you may know i do not have great faith in the medical field, especially with being forth comming.
So in my latest of brain enhanced theories, besides AD being an auto immune caused problem.
I feeel that many that are in so called health care facilities, supposedly suffering from one form of dementia or another, ARE NOT.
Yes that is what I said, i have over the years read the various studies, from stopping dementia to curing it and everything in between, poultry feathers i say.
I believe that many in these facilities are victims of the stupidity of doctors and the greed that they and the pharmacuetical companies have.
It is called OVER MEDICATION, we give a drug for a real disease, it causes side effects, so a different one for the side effects and it causes, you guessed side effects, so what do we do, give another drug, until the poor bastard is taking so many drugs it is no wonder that they become mentally unaware, physically impared, not to say just out right dead.
I am not saying DEMENTIA does not exist.
I am just saying before a diag of such is accepted it may be well to check the meds one is on and see their side effects and maybe under professional care, start weening them from the drugs and see what takes place.
Ok joe you say,but think hard about this one.
A pill for this and that and one to take care of those pills, plus over the counter meds these folks maybe taking, what are the real affects.
Plus most drugs are prescribed by a test method on most younger to middle aged peoples and their respective optimal wieght and hieght.
Not on a 65 yr old person out of shape with adjusting for age, wieght and other meds and factors taken in.
I have it, proven by Brain tests, of course death will be the ultimate diag for the AD, not the FTD.
Also on more than one occasion in ture medical language and diag after being tested I have been informed that "Joe, there is nothing up there", so there you have it.
What i amtrying to say is always wiegh what you are told check it out, get a 2nd opinion and research any drug prescribed and find out if it has reactions with others.
God Bless & Keep You and This Country of Ours!!!!!

I know I at least got up because I am tpying this.
Things are getting more and more confusing and I cannot be sure of anything that I may do.
I guess this is one of those what the hell posts, because I am not even sure why i am doing this.
Plain fact my brain and i seem to be going more and more in diffferent directions.
Maybe time has come for Lynn to post for me.
I just tell her best I dna ow i am feeling and let her put it into words.
At least the speeeling will be much better.
I am starting to feeel more and more detached from everyone and everything.
Good old AD & FTD are hard at workand doing what they do best.
Well later i am completely at a loss right now.

Sunday, May 8, 2011What the Alzheimer's Loved One WantsI am a guest author on Joseph Potocny's blog at http://living-with-alzhiemers.blogspot.com/  Joe has Alzheimer's and Frontal Lobe Dementia and writes frequently about his situation.
He is quite an advocate!
I also reviewed his book in January and February posts on our Plant City blog and he put those reviews on his blog.
Recently on Joe's blog I developed nine guidelines to present to Potocny and he wrote six more.
So here are the fifteen guidelines that loved ones may be wanting from us.
1.
Don't do everything for me.
2.
Listen carefully and figure out the feelings behind what I am saying.
3.
Don't nag me.
Create a checklist for me to help me remember.
The rest of the world has to use check lists also.
4.
Enjoy my personality--I am not the disease of Alzheimer's.
5.
Plan outings with me and don't be embarrassed by whatever I do or say in public.
6.
Give me visual clues for memory including a calendar.
7.
Sing and joke with me.
8.
Bring me into your world.
9.
Say one thought at a time.
10.
Do not hover over me.
11.
No sudden changes.
12.
Do not ask how I am doing constantly.
13.
Watch your being needy.
14.
Do not patronize me.
15.
GIVE ME MY SPACE AND QUIET TIME.Thank you, Joe, for letting me pick your excellent brain!Posted by NewKidontheBlogg at 8:51 PM 0 comments Links to this postLabels: communication, conversations with ALZ patients, forgetfulness, guidelines, Joseph Potocny

Yesterday i had blood drawn for tests for my physical next week.
Then I spent the rest of the morning with my phsycologist .
It was interesting, i have seen mim for nearly 7 years or so with breaks.
We were talingi about the so called new advances in Alzheimer's and the new guide lines for diag.
and treating.
Funny part about it is as we talked he remembered I had said most of this years agao.
And it has been posted on this blog in various forms over the years.
I dound that all to be interesting that these so called experts only needed to talk to me or someone like me with the disease to get these startling new ideas and would have cost nothing.
But what the fuck do we know, we are sick and mindless.
But it does add credability to sites like mine, that we know what they cannot figure out.
I had another doctor write me recently, and the gist of what he said as I could understand it and questioning him on what he said is that he basically in simple terms agrees about the profession, and pharma companies, they all have their heads up their collettive asses and only promote drugs for money sake, because no matter how you want to cut it, the drugs DO NOT WORK!
It is still about 8 years from diag.
to the end drugs or no drugs.
Our paper here had an article today about a former mayor, whose wife was diag.
7 years ago and just died.
I know we hear about the 15 to 20 year sufferers, but they only exist because someone was smart enough to notice it in its infancy stages.
The ten or so years of true EOA which most pros call DDSS, my term for Distraticed, Depressed, Stress, Syndrome.
I have my moments, what is difficult is getting what is in my brain cell, down to my fingers and then getting them to type what it is that is their.
I have to do it quickly or if I think to long ( 5-6  seconds) it is gone and never gets said.
I know from some mail i got i insulted the Alz.org, but i want you to know that was intentional.
Yes they help caregivers, they have done shit for me and I have contacted them many times.
Even my local San Diego Chapter, who I gave copies of my book to for their lending library.
And they wanted me to help with things and with the State, YES YES YES i said.
Their ultimate answer and reuests have been complete silence, and I have heard this from others, including some Drs.
I know their are good people working for them and my attack if you will is not on them, but what seems to be an organizzational lax of understanding the sufferer.
Oh yes they know it is not pretty, but it does not seem that they have the first idea of the real terror in our minds and the loneliness and the difficulty we have telling anyone, because we know you do not know or understand this hell, you are not in it.
Time to shut up, i am getting to angry and feel like telling most everyone out there to fuck off, but we are family and I need you and I think you need me also while I can spout off and make some sense.
God Bless & Keep You & This Country of Ours!

Many of you have lost loved ones to this disease, mothers, fathers, grandparents, friends, siblings and this list goes on.
Mother's Day is tomorrow and to all Mother's long gone, still with us and to be, I wish you the happiest of times.
This is only one cost of the Disease, the losss of a loved one.
Just think how we feel as we loose the loved one that we care about so greatly, ourself.
Sounds selfish, but it is a reality.
The other day to me it was just yesterday, because there is only today and yesterday for me, I walked into the "OFFICE", doe not everyone have to have one in their howse.
A bedroom with a comuter in it, WOW.
Anyway i walked in and the next i knew my wife was in helping me get up off the floor.
See this 700 pound pigeon, does not remember how to fly to well.
I bet i wennt down with grace, style and diginity and a thud.
problem is not remembering what took place, one minute i am standing the next on the floor like a beached whale.
I know this is only part of the disease and what is to come, but it is taking longer to get up and the aches take longe to leave and some now stay, they found a home.
Good thing I drank heavily in my twenties, I learned how to fall and get back up.
So I guess we are born we grow and start to return to our original days.
The more i look at this disease the more I feel it is auto immune in nature.
I notice our Alzheimer's Organization here in the states touts the stars who have parents or sweethearts who have parents with the disease as being such brave soles and all the work they do for Alzheimer's.
I say stick it up your ass you do nothing for us.
At least Canada has speakers at meetings with the disease so that the true story comes out.
I know I have a couple of friends up their speading the word at AD meetings by the Alzheimers Assoc.
of Canada.
Kudos to you folks.
Here forget it.
See personal experience has shown me the nature of their commitmennt.
The San Diego Chapter, visited me the wife would remember when, it was shortly after the Walk here in Oceanside, I think.
They met to discuss my book, the lady was very nice as i remember and felt that my story needed to be told and by me and that i would be of greqat service, i was even asked if i would be willing to speak and help, well I said yes.
gave them books for their lending library.
They would be in touch I was told, the bullshit put off statement.
Well they went to the state capital for getting things done, i was asked originally if I would go, yes, however time came and pass and so did their silence.
I get emails to help support them.
I think not, you can have as much support from me as you have given me.
The Alzheimer's Disease Reasearch Foundation gets my help they at least are doing things.
Had to get this off my chest.
It has been burning my ass for a long time now.
Many good people work and volunteer for the Alz.org,, but the whole does not even come close to equalling the parts.
I have noticed lately that ai seem to be going away, that is the best way i can say it, seems like me and that around me are starting to part ways more and more each day.
I am rambling on so I will say so long for the time being.
God Bless & Keep You & This Country of Ours!!

Joe, you get so much traffic on your blog and I thought I would give my impressions on how we caregivers/family members can emotionally support people with Alzheimer's and dementia.
Don't do everything for me.
Listen carefully and figure out the feelings behind what I am saying.
Don't nag me.
Create a checklist for me that helps me remember.
The rest of the world has to use check lists also.
Enjoy my personality--I am not the disease of Alzheimer's.
Plan outings with me and don't be embarrassed by whatever I do or say in public.
Give me visual clues for memory including a calendar.
Sing and joke with me.
Bring me into your world.
Say one thought at a time.
So Joe, since you are my Alzheimer's sounding board, what would you add to this list to make you feel loved and appreciated?

Yep that is the score.
Now what do you want to do about it.
NO CAUSE - OF COURSE NO CURE - & MEDS THAT DO NOT DO MUCH.
Yes now they say it starts, the brain shrinking, 10 years before first diagnosis.
New three stages, shrinkage, mild to moderate loss and final stages.
These brilliant morons, sorry that is what they are, have confirmed everything I told my physchologist over 6 years agao.
What these folks call Early Onset is not, it is mid stage.
I have been fighting the fight for years now, daily.
I have lost on a daily basis.
What is it that people do not understand?
This Disease KILLS.............
When does the truth get told over the media, we are not mentally ill people we suffer from a deadly disease, get with it people.
I have grown tired of the battle and tired of trying to help the word get spread and fighting my own decline, I no longer have the physical or mental or emotiooonal strength or will to continue to fight.
So no more from me.
only that which I can remmeber happening each day and coming forth and trying to tell you, no more fight no more argumment, my time to rest has come, it is time for others to pick it up.
People only want to hear from those that are nicey nice, well you all know me simple and raw to the point.

Bulletin from the cause: Support Alzheimer's ResearchGo to Cause Posted By: Fisher Center To: Members in Support Alzheimer's Research Significant Finding in Nine Months by Fisher ScientistsScientists at the Fisher Center for Alzheimer's Disease Research at The Rockefeller University, led by Paul Greengard, Ph.D., and Jennifer Warner-Schmidt, Ph.D., have shown that anti-inflammatory drugs, which include ibuprofen, aspirin and naproxen, reduce the effectiveness of the most widely used class of antidepressant medications, theselective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs, taken for depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder and anxiety disorders.
This surprising discovery, published online this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, may explain why so many depressed patients taking SSRIs do not respond to antidepressant treatment and suggests that this lack of effectiveness may be preventable.
The study may be especially significant in the case of Alzheimer's disease.
Such patients commonly suffer from depression and unless this can be treated successfully, the course of the illness is likely to be more severe.
Depression in the elderly is also a risk factor for developing Alzheimer's disease and researchers have suggested that treating depression in the elderly might reduce the risk of developing the disease.

  From my family to you and yours.
If you do not celebrate this time of the year, let it be known that you are still welcome in my home.
Lately I have been having more days of being in between knowing and not knowing what I am doing or where the heck I am.
It seems to be happening on a much greater scale now.
I sleep a lot more now, just dose right off at the drop of an eye lid.
It seems the evening hours bring back memories of my past, but not during the day I have a hard time remembering.
I guess i suffer from sundowners from the time I wake up and near the evening I have moon uppers, but I have always done things differently than other people.
My in your face attituded.
Lynn is having to remind me daily now on what day and month it is, we are not counting the year, it does not matter anyhow.
Have enough problem remmmebering that there are seven days in a week.
I am stuck on two, Saturday and Sunday, cann't get past them.
I hope you have a great day tomorrow and all those that follow.

I was reading my friend Mary's blog today, it is on the right side.
She lives in Canada and we have chatted back and forth for quiet awhile.
She posted a site A Picture of Picks Disease from the inside out.
I am posting the link here also.
You see I have AD and FTD.
The article may help you understand me better, since it is writtten by a Dr. (you know my normal thoughts here) that suffers from FTD and explains things very well.
His feelings on the publics knowledge do not difffer from mine.
But he is kinder than I, surlely he speaks the truth and feelings as he understands them, i just happen to be more direct and believe in the raw basics they speak of the horrors more directly.
I have read a new study that shows that the brain starts its' shrinking journey a full 10 years before the first diagnosis of AD is made.
Thank You oh Great One's.
You have once again proven your swiftness of understanding and well deserved Paper Hanging Degrees.
I have said on this blog as I have been reminded that I knew things were wrong when I turned 50 tem yrs before my first diag.
in 2004 by my pshycologist whose father died from AD.
The FTD and AD confirmed by a pet scan 2006/2007 do not remember.
So Early Onset is not Early Onset but as i have thought more mid stage.
These assholes do not talk to us they are to fricken smart.
Sme food for thought in reading the various ground breaking studies of the cause and cure and preventions of this disease, I have come to my own earth shattering and astounding cause for ALZHEIMER'S & OTHER DEMENTIA'S, they are Auto Immune Diseases, all the studies point that way since it is enzymes and the such causing plaque build ups and other nasties, and from the med shows and the experts these things are auto immune, beta amaloyid protiens, formed when enzymes attack white corpusle cells if I have my thinking cap on.
Since I believe that Dementia in and of itself is a full body assault to my lowly brain poser of one cell, it spells auto immune.
See I consuletd with DR. HOUSE and his whiteboard and he agrees.
Trust me I am not making fun, i believe that this is where it lies.

By now i wolud think that we all know about the mental trials that allll of us with this disease go thru.
Not remembering people, turning around and meeeting a new friend each time, wondering where we are, who you are, where is home, my glasses hell where are my pants.
Forgetting to use the bathroom timely oooh well.
Spending and forgetting we did it, driving those close to us to exhaustion and we do not even realize it and in most cases do not care.
How rotten we can get and next minute the world is rosey to us and you have the problem.
The list goes on and on and on.
But there is another side to this story, not being able to walk right anymore, cannot drive because forgetting what to do (our freedom is gone).
Tiring easily from practically little effort.
Standing one moment the next investigating the dirt on the floor or cracks in the cement.
Trembling a good deal of the time, eyes get worse, food tastess funny, sleeping is a joke, not at night we go to the daytime, walking into things because we do not see them, winding up with cuts and the like because we do not realise that we have been injured, not eating just because.
This is the other side of our world and much more but my brain cell is to empty right now to remember or clogd up, get the draino.
I find listing other things for you is easier these days then really talking to you anymore.
I forget what I want to say, I sit down with this whole well organized thought out post in my brain somewhere, and it never shows up when I start, it goes walking down the street.
I feel like i repeat the samethings over and over, but that is what happens here in Alzheimer's land.
It seems no matter how many times I am told yes we listen that no one really hears us.
You suffer and all the books about you are considered to be by experts and people who know about this disease, but folks sorry you do not have a clue to this sise of the fence.
I have pretty much lost sight of your side now also.
My voice is becoming quiet and running out of its one time fire, i am worn out spent and just plain tired.
I sit and wait for the bus to take me home most of the time, these moments of knowing and suddenly not are incredidablly painful and frustrating.I ramble on and on and on and cannot tell you what I really am talking about most of the time.
Well friends take care and be good to yourselves.
God Bless & Keep You & This Country of Ours!!

Yes you need this toolbar, you say Why?
Because I said so.
On the right side of the screen you can scroll down and you will find a note to install My Toolbar.
You need to know it only works in IE and Firefox for the time being.
Features it has a picture of me and Lynn, if you click on it or click on the link bar you will come, guess where, you got it right - this blog.
You can also go to my Facebook or Twitter accounts or just my twitter feeds.
Now it gets exciting, you can go to your own Facebook or Twitter accounts butons on the right, you can even go to Gmail if you have an account with them.
Funny looking button allows you to add things to your wish list at Amazon.com.
NOW for the exciting and most thrilling part of all, THERE IS A SEARCH BOX, yes just what everyone  needs a search box.
Did I mention it is free, no cost or obligation.
What does this have to do with Alzheimer's you might be asking.
Fair Question.
Not a damn thing, just thought I would give you something free if you want it.

Well Doc is out here in gold old CA.
He is being dragged around by his wife, that woman must never feed him, hell i make up two of him, probably i am in trouble again, oh well.
Went up to see Doc at one of his book signing, had a pleassant time.
For me a very tiring trip, 160 miles round trip, I am toooooo old for that stuff.
It was good to see Mr.
Skinny with a red face from our sun, that will teach a winter wonderland boy to mess with us.
Nice day for me, tired, woren out but got to spend time with a good friend and met some new people, who I cannot even tell you what they look like now.

To those that went before me, I am trying to give you a voice as well.
The title is a link to a listing of those who of fame have died from AD.
And Still the medical profession and sorry for this Alzheimer's Association have done crap to help us.
Lot of studies, lots of meds, NO CAUSE, NO CURE & MEDS THAT DO NOT REALLY WORK!!!!
Only true diagnosis, cut the brain open at death.
The closer i get to the end the angrier i get at this world of ours, 2nd most dreaded disease and who talks about it.
So Called Experts, who really have no idea what we with it go through, WHY?, because they do not listen or ask they know it all.
Everything causes it and everything can cure or hault it, in the end all this fails, we just fucking die.
Cancer Society song is Happy Birthday, great for the survivors which there are millions.
Alzheimer's new song, So Long It has Been Good To Know You!!!
no survivors.
Yes there is anger in me today, not for myself but for those that do not speak out without concern for hurting peoples feelings and not being polically correct.
I stand at the gate to this World of Dementia and I put out my had to each that enters every 70 seconds, to welcome them, to tell them they are not alone regardless of the failures of their fellow man to really help them.
Go ahead an rip me a new one.
I am ready, but when you do prove me wrong and show me that ONE SURVIVOR.
God Bless & Keep You & This Country of Ours!!!!

What follows is a statement made of Caring.com by a supposed, i use the term very loosely and with distain, 20yr Professional Caregiver.
Persons words just prove what I have said here, we are not understood and we need a voice, and not from the professionals.
My response to this very ill informed ass and Lynn's is there also.
Pleaase understadn that most of the people on Caring.com are really people who care and are trying to undeerstand and get good information not this type of pure crap and idiocracy.
"it's an illness, it's difficult but it's not ugly, horrible, demeaning, cruel.i know that no-one i ever look after ever could remember my name, but i remember theirs.
and i walk beside them.
that's what caregiving is.
it's not oppositional, it's walking beside who this person actually is now.
it's about forgiving them for their illness.
"Frena wrote the above.
Well maybe if you had the disease Lady, you might just find out how ugly, horrible, deameaning, cruel and damnable it is.
See I suffer from it, so do not hand me that load of crap.
And i do not need yours or anyone elses forgiveness for me having this disease.
Expert you are not, you do not live in this world.
I and over 5 million people at present in thsi countyr of orus do.Joseph/this is Joe's wife, Lynn, I am surprised that he was very calm in the response to your letter.
This is a disease.
It is ugly and horrible.
Nobody wants to loose their minds and that is what happens with Alzheimer's.
I do not know of anybody that has this disease who needs to ask for forgiveness from you or anybody else.
The people who have cancer which is a disease don't ask for forgiveness why should the people who have Dementia.
Maybe you need to rethink your profession.

I do think that my husband with his Vascular Dementia and Alzheimer's compensates well.
I do think that Joe with his Frontal Lobe Dementia and Alzheimer's compensates well.
Joe blogs and testifies in court.
Both men are fighting.
They have got to be using brain cells from somewhere.
I would like to see the researchers follow both men around.
A new article from the Alzheimer's Weekly hints at compensation.
Use healthy brain cells to compensate, it reads here.
My husband puts up signs so he can help determine which bin is for newspapers and which is for glass and plastic.
He takes notes on what the day holds and checks with the calendar.
He thinks ahead about our camping and how the camping electrical circuits can be fixed.
He recalls good times with Jake and Sally and wants to know when we will see them again.
"When are we going to Disney", he wants to know.
God bless our sweethearts!

I got the following comment the other day, you all need to help this lady.
You know me, it would be so what the hell do you think he is going through, toughen up and deal with it he has to 24/7.
But I know you all will give her the guidance and advice she needs on her side of the fence.
Many of you probably know I am 66 and the old gal i am married to is a robust 50.
So i hope she also replies to this.
Enough of my ranting and carrying on.
Help this lady!
_______________________________________________________________________________ Anonymous   has left a new comment on your post "When is it time?
":  Hello all My husband was diagnosed 4 years ago with mild memory loss.
We were doing fine until 6 months ago.
all of a sudden he started packing boxes and telling me he has to go home.
He was home.
It continued to go down hill from there.
So fast.
That is what is so confusing to me.
He is in a nursing facility now.
The doctors advised me to do this.
The big question of the day is, Do I feel guilty.
The big answer is yes.
we had our 35th wedding anniversary in January 2011.
He was there and I was at home.
This is so difficult.
I look for a support group regarding early onset Alzheimer but there is no group for spouses.
He just turned 69 years old.
I'm much younger and very empty.
______________________________________________________________________________ This is a good family here and I am glad she found us.

I know or at least think that many thought testifying in court was a big deal.
But I had an attorney that ledd me through it, the entire eveidence package in fron of me and a judge that was just supper and helped everytime i sat therre with a blank and confused look on my face.
Trust me that is why it took two days for me.
Mr. Computer Brain, buned out circuits.
In case you are wondering what the big earth movement in Oceanside was on i think Thursday, it was the shifty old whale here hitting the deck as I tripped and fell over the cat.
Not so nimble anylonger.
Good thing have exxtra extra padding on my butt..
However ever since then I have been really having difficulty talking and trying to make sensse of things.
Lynn says my face is lost when we talk or i look at her.
Really i am lost and really do not like what is going on.
Have found out in round about ways why my voice is not listened to or my book received, I am just not gentle, kind and nuturing in my telling of this fucking disease.
I guess i need to be more politically correct I think is the phrase, well bite my ass, there is nothing grand and wonderful of about having this disease.
I have one thing for me though, I stand at the gate to the world of mine and about every 70 or so seconds I get to greet a new friend, shake their hand and hug them and welcome them to the darkside.
Dr. Joe Sivak will be in Long Beach in April promoting his book and Lynn and i hope to be able to make it up there to see him and maybe harass him a little those physcs need it.

Yes Carol you have asked me to bring the wrath of the Lord on us.
Me making a video of me dancing, is like asking 40 Blue Whales to come ashore and dance, it would shake the ground and mountains of the world, then you said about maybe one of me singing.
Well i do not know if you ever herd a bull mose bellow, I am far worse, cows calve, horses fold, birds take flight and forest fall down.
And gardening, my idea is dig a hole put the pott with the plant in the ground, if the grass or plants get brown spray paint them with green paint.
I think he who made us all would not allow such a plaque on his world done by one like me, that is his job.
I have tried to play him in my life, got no where but arrested, told to go away, drunk and strung out for years, toooooo many battle scars to do that anymore, so my friend no way.
I have thought about making a video for You Tube, but as a suffer of this disease to verbaly tell folks about this world that i and many others live in.
Not the crud from the experts and sorry caregivers, who really do not know who we are, but love us enough to help.
People need to really know what it truly is like for us that suffer.
Have tried with my blog and my book and well, my ego is now in the way and it has gotten kikced in the ass.
Maybe the video might help as my time grows shorter.
I know I sound damn good today, but I am in a rotten mood, spent two days in court testifing  in a fraud case that cost my son 56000 investment.
Good thing the judge wa s a compassionate and understanding person, because you all know how I can say things and how blunt i get.
I tired as hell no sleep, hours in the court room and me basically the only witness for two days, traveling to court being out with people which just drives me squirerler than I already am.
Meds have not helped much but I am here today and I guess that is what counts.
Confused as hell, not really knowing what I feel or want or much of who I am anymore.
I thank all of you that responded to Lynns last post, it shows what a family we are becomming and she really was touched.
But why not she is with me, so you know she is sick to.
But I do thank you, because what you did and said is why this blog is here and all are welcomed.

This is a question I pose to all of you caregivers.
When is it time to take away all of the freedom that a person with AD or any kind of dementia?
Like the bank accounts... You take them over and they still have to put their fingers in it so things are not quite right, or you know they need to go to the DR. but refuse.
The dentist, but they refuse.
Takeing a bath and unless you are hog tying them down they are not going to take it.
No I am not talking about you Joe.
I also know that if things are not taken care of it is a form of abuse but what do you do?How do you deal with those issues.
I know that they are coming for me and I can't hogtie Joe down.
He is just too strong for me.
This is something that I would think all caregivers deal with at some point.
When do you put into effect the POWER of attorney and tell them that they can no longer make any decision?
It is sad that they are losing what they are and knowing it but when do they not know anymore?
Input from all of you would be good because I will be needing this information too and I am not looking forward to it.
This will be a battle of epic porportions when I do.Take care

The stinker uses voice software.
He suffers from Lewy Body and has recently joined our family here.
Please visit him and say howdy and make him welcomed.
I have been busy the last few dayss or weeks not sure which it is and not really sure what i have been doing.
I look at thiss new beast of humanity that I have, and wonder why, i cannt spell or remember any better because of it.
But it has a 23" screeen which i cannot see without my glasses either, so what the frick.
Today has slipped away from me again.i just do not know what to tell you except that things are not bettter and are not going to be.
At present nothing seeems to be working out right, but then again i am not sure what is right or not anymore.
I know i am becomming very indifferent, whoa a big word there, to most everoything and every one around me and basically do not care.
Dr. Joe Sivack i think wrote on his blog or i heard it somwhere who the hell knows that we in this world i live in really become who or what we really are, if that be true i hope it ends soon.
because i do not like who i am now, by the way i am not sure of who that is any how.
i would tell you who these two are but their names escape me.
not really it is my wonderful wife Lynn and that bastard she now hangs around with.
The woman just will not listen to anyone.

It is like i have become two different people.
Actually the same but in two different worlds.
I feel like the Joe I was is sitting up in the balcony at a play.
And i see the actors on the stage and they are me and those I know, but I am no longer part of their world or they mine.The world they are in, i am all screwed up in and walkand talk in circles.
But the Joe in the Balcony is who he once was, this is getty scarey now.
I knew things would happen but not this.
I am starting to progress faster each day and it is harder to get here to write and tell you.
I have a new computer, an all in one, so only a screen sits on my desk.

Hi Joe, It was great speaking with you.
Here is the picture of me holding my mom's picture on my last of the 54 Colorado 14,000 mountains.
I will take this picture to the top of the 7 Summits as I climb them to raise awareness and $1M for Alzheimer's research.
All the best, Alan Alan will be attacking Mount Everest is a few weeks.
It will be his third summit climb for Alzheimer's Awarness, fund raising and for caregiver support.
I hope you all join me in wishing him wel.
He is supposed to keep me posted on things and how they are progressing.
Alan has already accomplished what I have tried to for those of us that suffer to give us a voice, am i jealous, YES.
He is giving a voice to Alzheimer's via his noterity for the climbs and the companies backing him.
He has reached approximately 20 million folks so far, with radio talk shows, articles written and press coverage.
He hopes to raise 1 million for Azheimer's Reasearch and the like.
Alan asked me if I would go to the mountains and I told him I did once and it looked at me and said "Fool Go Home"!God Bless You Alan on your journey.

First, THANK YOU Joe for inviting me to post on your page!
I've been a big fan of yours since the HBO series came out...as soon as I viewed it, I knew I had to look you up on the big wide web.A bit about me:  I've been a nurse for 17+ years and have a very special place in my heart for the geriatric community.
I've been an instructor for 8 years at a Technical school.
I teach adult students in different allied health fields.
After beating the floor for several years, I felt that it was my calling to pass on what knowledge I have to others.
I believe that every person living in a nursing home or receiving home health care deserves to be treated with dignity and respect.
As far as I am concerned, there just is not enough of that these days.
It takes a very special, and patient person to care for elders, regardless of what disease process they are going through.
In my Certified Nurse Aide class, I have my students do a research paper on Elder Abuse and another on Alzheimer's Disease.
Part of my teachings over Alzheimer's involves the HBO documentary - The Alzheimer's Project.
And you, as well as the others that are and were inflicted with this monsterous disease.
In case you haven't been told yet, thank you for allowing your story to be told.
Today after I took the students on the Alzheimer's Brain Tour, I showed them the documentary.
I am always amazed at comments the students make.
"I didn't know that this disease was that bad" or "What a horrible disease to get".
My answer every month is always the same:  Yes it is, on both accounts.
There is no cure for Alzheimer's as of today, but my hopes and dreams is that there will be... soon.
A couple of weekends ago, I was on a flight to Houston, reading your book when the lady sitting next to me commented on the book cover.
She said that it was an unusual picture, but it had a catchy title.
I explained to her who you were and during the conversation, she informed me that she has a mother who has the dreaded disease.
I gave her your website and I hope that she has had a chance to log on and look you up.
The experiences and emotions that you are dealing with IS helping others out here Joe.
How can it not?
No one knows what a person with Alzheimer's is going thru or feeling unless someone tells us.
You are doing that for all of us.
Thank you for that.I will post more in the coming days and as always, I look forward to reading your blog.
Thank you again for inviting me to post.Hug Lynn and hug yourself!Judy

I have found that old memories aer stil there but they have no time stamp you might say, I can tell you about them, but part of the probelm is that two or three may get mixed together, facts are pretty good, but knowing exactly  which memory they belong to, well you have to guess.
New memories, I have only about 2 days worth, they do not stay for long at all.
In fact have trouble with telling you about this morning even.
The wife colored her hair today, did it this morning so I am told, I did not notice.
Later we were up in our office, that sounds so officey doesn"t it, just a extra bedroom with the computer.
But that makes us Yuppies we have an office.
I was looking at this woman in front of me and knew I thought I knew her but something was not right.
I had her turn around and finally my mind put back some old color in her hair and I knew it was Lynn.
Said you colored your hair, YES, when this morning, oooh i said.
God Bless & Keep You & This Great Country of Ours!

Joe, thanks so much for inviting me to post.
This time I will introduce you and Lynn to my world.
Later I will write other posts, including positive comments about your book and what I am learning as a caregiver.
I am a 66 year old caregiver for my 73 year old husband who has Mixed Dementia as you do.
The difference is he has Vascular Dementia and Alzheimer's whereas you have Frontal Dementia and Alzheimer's.
I will call him DH, hubby or husband here.
DH stands for "Dear Husband".
Before I got more information, I vascinated between having my head in the sand or being depressed.
I may get depressed from time to time, but I can never have my head in the sand as you see the airstream RVs in this picture I took from a poster yesterday at a RV dealer.
We drive by this Tampa area scene often .
A year and a half ago when hubby needed to retire due to his memory issues, someone came by our home and asked to buy our first popup camper.
DH said yes and I was so sad when they carted it off for $900.
However this month we bought a used popup camper from our friends "Sally and Jake" (not their real name)--for $50 and so you know we have been fixing it up--having new tires put on, etc..
It is almost finished.
I saved about $3000 by patching the canvas myself.
Our total cost so far is about $600 and it has many more features inside than our first popup had.
We have several camping trips planned with Sally and Jake.
Sally and Jake had upgraded to a small RV.
Jake, who also has Alzheimer's, and DH  love to tell each other the same stories over and over.
Monday the four of us celebrated Valentines Day by going to a pizza place.
We talked about camping for the most part.
When DH and Jake need us full-time, either Sally or myself will stay home with the husbands while the other one works (we both substitute teach and I teach classes for DUI offenders periodically).
This was Sally's brilliant suggestion.
Meanwhile we enjoy every day.
I am very patient with hubby when he repeatedly asks the same questions over and over.
Once I was a widow and I love having a hubby who asks me repeatedly how my day was.
We love each other very much.
Jake and DH have their heads in the sand about their impairment, but Sally and I are very proactive.
I am going to a workshop on Alzheimer's on Thursday and taking notes for Sally.
Cordially, Carol

I have had the honor of speakinnng to Alan Rodgers, the nut, who is climbing the 7 highest summits on each connntinent for Alzheimer's Awareness.
I call him a nut because he climbs these mountains, me I fall down them.
He is going to keep us in the looop.
He has reached over 20 million people already through the presss coverage and talk shows he has been on.
Alzheimer's took his mother about 11/2 yrs.

Yesterday my physcollogsit and I discussed this topic.
Generally from time of this diagnosis till time to leave is about 8 years.
Check the people that have died from the HBO special and the timeline and that of Sarge Schriver diag.
in 2003 just died 2011.
The list goes on.
We got to talking about the time period and EOA.
My opinion only is that what is called EOA is not, it is more towards the middle stages.
My reasoning, which is questoinable, is most of us are told when we start to notice things going wrong, oh it is STRESS, you are just DEPRESSED, you are DISTRACTED and you know the other bullshit.
It generally is years before anyone really starts to listen and connnect the dots and finally does reall testing and oh well now you have EOA.
I say no, you had EOA possibly for as much as 10 years befoer those white coats figured it out.
Of course you had no idea, even though you kept on saying no that is not the problem this is.
But of course you did not read page 89 of the med journal of AD and the box you have to fit in to have it.
Yes we both disagreed with each other at the beginning, but since his dad died from AD, he thought back and started to understand what I was trying to say, just maybe the real deal.
He is a good man, shit he has put up with me for almost 6 years, so who is the sicker one!
He asked me when I first noticed things going goofin and best I could remember I was around fifty, i could not multitask without notes anymore or even handle the number of tasks that I could and it got worse and worse.
Of course i had SDD syndrome, right.
What I am trying to say while I am still somwhat together is, if you feel there are reall problems going on in your head, do not allow your doctor to just push it off as the SDD syndrome.
You have to fight for you period.

Due to an on slaught of complaints, meaning your eyes are getting as bad as mine, I have once again changed the look of the blog.
Hope you all like it.
If not wait a few months or so and when I remember I may change it again.
Till then may all you "normal people", whatever that is, enjoy your life on the otherside of the fence, because it is really slippery over here on this side.

Yes this disease even takes that away from you.
I know I have griped abouut the brain going away, but it seems my feet and legs are developing a mind of their own now.
Several times I have falleen and trip and got hurt, but never thought of how AD is affecting me in that way.
Well the other day I had some sense knoccked into me.
I was putting away the garbage cans, tuff duty right?
We let me tell you it can be, putting the last can away I was practicing walking backwards, front ways not that good, try something new: Well I check where I was going turneed back around, steppped out of my sliper, apparently steped on my foot, you got it I went on a trip.
My rather robust bottom slammed on the walk way, my back hit the pavers and this empty head of mine proceeded to put a rather nice looking dent in the one metal storage shed we have.
I have to admit the shed looks good it now has character.
Me I have character to, back hurts like hell, my head hurts, the crack in my bottom has widened and I have been advised by my keepers, that maybe I should not do that anymore.
You loose one freedom after another with this crap.
Until we meet again, take care of yourselves.
I hold walking classes every Tuesday at 1pm PST.
God Bless & Keep You & This Country of Ours!!!

From: Alana Rogers <ARogers@Biosector2.com> To: JosephPotocny@yahoo.com Sent: Thu, February 3, 2011 7:57:16 AM Subject: National Family Caregivers Association Joins 7 Summits Climb for Alzheimer's  Dear Joseph, Knowing your interest in Alzheimer's disease and family caregivers, I wanted to share with you a recent update on The 7 Summits Climb for Alzheimer's: Memories are Everything campaign.
To kick off 2011 - The Year of the Family Caregiver - the Alzheimer's Immunotherapy Program of Pfizer Inc. and Janssen Alzheimer Immunotherapy today announced the addition of the National Family Caregivers Association (NFCA), an organization that empowers family caregivers to act on behalf of themselves and their loved ones, as a supporter of The 7 Summits Climb for Alzheimer's: Memories are Everything campaign.
NFCA joins the campaign just as alpine mountaineer and Alzheimer's disease advocate Alan Arnette successfully summitted Aconcagua in Argentina, his second climb of the 7 Summits.
From the top of the summit, Alan dedicated his Aconcagua climb to family caregivers of loved ones with Alzheimer's (you can listen to his audio dispatch here:http://www.alanarnette.com/blog/2011/01/29/audio-dispatch-from-aconcagua-5/).
As you may already know, Alan is seeking to climb the 7 Summits, the highest peak on each continent, in order to help raise awareness of the enormous financial and personal burden Alzheimer's places on people with the disease, their family caregivers and society.
With two summits completed in just a few months, Alan is well on his way to achieving his ambitious goal.
Alan was his mother's caregiver during the time she lived with the disease and knows only too well that the burden of caring for these people often falls to family members and friends:*         In the U.S., an estimated 10.9 million unpaid caregivers see to the daily needs of people struck by Alzheimer's*         In 2009, these caregivers provided about 12.5 billion hours of care *         Caring for a person with Alzheimer's can be overwhelming, and research shows that caregivers themselves are often at an increased risk for depression and illness*         In the U.S. the indirect and direct costs of caring for people with Alzheimer's are estimated to be more than $ 100 billion a year Alzheimer's disease, the nation's 6th most deadly disease, gradually destroys a person's memory and ability to learn, reason, make judgments, communicate and carry out daily activities like bathing and eating.
Alan hopes to raise $1 million to go directly to the Cure Alzheimer's Fund(tm), and now NFCA to advance Alzheimer's research and provide support for family caregivers, respectively.
You can follow Alan's journey and encourage people to donate to his cause by visiting www.Climb4AD.com orwww.Facebook.com/Climb4AD.
Additional information is included in the press statement below.
Please let me know if you have any questions or would like to speak with Suzanne Mintz, president and CEO of NFCA, or with Alan.
Best,Alana Alana RogersBiosector 2450 West 15th Street, 6th FloorNew York, NY 10011 P 212.845.5627F 212.845.5650www.biosector2.com ***************************************************** Below please find press statements issued on February 3, 2011 by Janssen Alzheimer Immunotherapy and Pfizer Inc. of the Alzheimer's Immunotherapy Program about The 7 Summits Climb for Alzheimer's: Memories are Everything campaign.
National Family Caregivers Association Supports Advocate in His Mission to Raise Awareness of the Burden of Alzheimer's Disease SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO (February 3, 2011) - Janssen Alzheimer Immunotherapy, together with its collaborator on the Alzheimer's Immunotherapy Program, Pfizer Inc., is pleased to announce the addition of the National Family Caregivers Association (NFCA), an organization that empowers family caregivers to act on behalf of themselves and their loved ones, as a supporter of The 7 Summits Climb for Alzheimer's: Memories are Everything campaign.
NFCA joins the campaign just as alpine mountaineer and Alzheimer's disease advocate Alan Arnette successfully summitted Aconcagua in Argentina, his second climb of the 7 Summits.
Through this campaign, Alan is seeking to climb the 7 Summits, the highest peak on each continent, in order to help raise awareness of the enormous financial and personal burden Alzheimer's places on people with the disease, their family caregivers and society.
In addition, he hopes to raise $1 million.
The funds he raises will go directly to the Cure Alzheimer's Fund(tm), and now NFCA to advance Alzheimer's research and support for family caregivers, respectively.
It is estimated that more than 5 million Americans have Alzheimer's and approximately 10.9 million unpaid caregivers see to their daily needs.
"The NFCA's participation in this campaign spotlights the vital and expanding role of the Alzheimer's caregiver, which is why we are so glad they have joined this effort," said Stef Heylen, MD, Chief Medical Officer and Head of Research and Development for Janssen Alzheimer Immunotherapy, on behalf of the Alzheimer's Immunotherapy Program.
"Through their participation in the 7 Summits campaign, NFCA will be able to reach even more family caregivers, providing education, support and a public voice." Prior to Aconcagua, Alan summitted the first of the 7 Summits -- Mt.
Vinson Massif, the highest peak in Antarctica -- in December.
Coming up in April, Alan is planning to summit Mount Everest, the highest peak in the world.
The Alzheimer's Immunotherapy Program of Janssen Alzheimer Immunotherapy and Pfizer Inc. is funding Alan's climbs so that all money he raises from donations will go directly to the organizations he has selected.
You can track Alan's progress or make a donation to one of his chosen charities by visiting www.Climb4AD.com or www.Facebook.com/Climb4AD.
"2011 marks the Year of the Caregiver, and as such, we are thrilled to join Alan in his efforts to raise awareness about Alzheimer's and the burden it places on family caregivers," said Suzanne Mintz, president and CEO of NFCA.
"We applaud Alan for his commitment, perseverance and tireless advocating for the AD community." Alzheimer's disease is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States, with another person newly diagnosed every 70 seconds.
The burden of caring for these patients often falls to family members.
Last year, these family caregivers provided about 12.5 billion hours of unpaid care.
Alzheimer's Immunotherapy ProgramThe Alzheimer's Immunotherapy Program of Janssen Alzheimer Immunotherapy and Pfizer Inc. is an equal collaboration committed to researching and developing selective products for the treatment and/or prevention of neurodegenerative conditions, including Alzheimer's disease.
The Alzheimer's Immunotherapy Program believes that it is possible to reduce the burden of disease through early intervention in the illness.
It is dedicated to delivering comprehensive and integrated solutions that help address the needs of people impacted by Alzheimer's disease.
Its research focuses on the beta amyloid hypothesis.
Scientific evidence supports the idea that preventing the accumulation and/or promoting the removal of beta-amyloid may have the potential to slow the progression of Alzheimer's disease and help preserve function in people with the disease.
This theory is being tested inclinical trials.

As you may or may not be aware I have self published my blog through Xlibris Publishing and it was released in 10/2011.
On the right hand side of my blog, yes I am promoting, hell I have to pay for this some how, you will find a new spot to buy my book, directly from me and I will even sign it for you.
I got a limited supply from Xlibris at special pricing.
The price includes any taxes and shipping costs for the price.
If need be I will send Uncle Louie after you.
Some Humor Today: EXERCISE  FOR PEOPLE  OVER 50Begin by standing on a comfortable surface, where you have plenty of room at each side.With a 5-lb potato bag in each hand, extend your arms straight out from your sides and hold them there as long as you can.
Try to reach a full minute, and then relax.Each day you'll find that you can hold this position for just a bit longer.
After a couple of weeks, move up to 10-lb potato bags.Then try 50-lb potato bags and then eventually try to get to where you can lift a 100-lb potato bag in each hand and hold your arms straight for more than a full minute.
(I'm  at this level.)
After you feel confident at that level,  put a potato in each bag.
God Bless & Keep You & This Country of Ours!!!

Yes i am back the last several days have been like living in a fog, you know where you are but cannot see the land marks.
O h well such is life.
_____________________________________________ Hi Joe, I watched both my parents succumb to Alzheimer's and the personal problems that came about because of this disease.
But God is good and He supplied every need as they appeared.
I have even written a book too - My Parents' Passing.
I wrote it to open the eyes of those who want to know and not make the same mistakes that I made.
I wrote it to help my family know should someone else in our family be diagnosed with it.
I can see how a person could hide this for several years from even a loved one.
Would it be in my best interest to know if I inherited this awful dementia and to be on medication?
Will it slow the process down enough to make a difference?
At what point does it not help?
Lord please bless us with a cure.
-Earlene __________________________________________________________________ I pulled Earlene's comment from one of my posts, I feel the questions assked a valid.
Earlene I will give you my take and hopefully others will comment.
Is it better to know if you have inheretited this disease or one step farther will get it?
I think not why worry your liffe away about something you have no control over, inspite of all the experts.
Live you life, laugh, have fun, eat right, get the sleep you need.
Go to the Dr. when needed, but make him or her answer as to why they came up with the aliment why the tests are necessary and what do theey reallly mean.
Remember this is your life.
Knowing will not slow down anything, hell they do not know what causes it, plenty of theories and studies all proving nothing.
All the knowledge that you may or may not get it and worring about it the point the point where all this knowwing and worring and wasting you life over maybe getting it ends when you get it if you do.
So let it go and live your life.
Remember The Alzheimer's Research Foundation, says thi: Zero know Causes Zero know Cures Zero medicines to reall help, i agree.
Pleas rest your brain and live for today, tomorrow will take care of itself.
God Bless & Keep You & This Country of Ours!
joe PS> Earlene should you join this family of ours we will welcome you with open arms, the 26 million of us world wide that have it would be your family, just think 26 million people that woudl share a bond with you and love you, what a blessing.

Yes thakns to you all I learned a new word.
I had to google it to find out what it meant, but none the less I like it.
So i am KVECHTING, that makes me a KVECHTER.
Yes a whinner, but I serve the wine, why do you not bring the cheese and crackers to the table?
Finally some of you let loose with what bothers you and I am glad, that is waht my blog is about, not only my journey and pain straight out, but you response straight out and back.
No holds barred here.
Do not be afraid of hurting my feelings with what you say, because I surely have no problem fighting back if it is called for.
I just want the real story about those of us in this World of Ours, told.
Not by "experts", "researchers", yes "caregivers", etc.
But by US!!!
Yes you suffer the pains of helping us and watching us waste away to mere shadows of a one time person.
Too many of those in my world are too afraid to say anything or are in denial and just do not want to tell anything.
Well we SUFFER greatly, we die many times, each day we die a little more, we forget who people are includdding our selves.
I do not think you can really understand the anger and frustration of this.
Sitting down to eat and you forgt how to use the fork or even what the fuck you are doing at the table.
My own wife scares the shit out of me at time when she comes up to me, because at that moment, I have no idea who she it or what the hell she is doing in my house.
We do not go out much, I am afraid to leave my house or yards, because I may not return here, this is my safe place for me.
Well you all be good to yourselves.
God Bless & Keep You & This Country of Ours!!

How many caregivers out there ask the person they are caring for "How do you feel about having this?"
Or "How do you feel when you can't remember?"
I know Joe has communicated to me and has been trying to do the same with all of the readers he has.
It is a tough concept to ask thses types of questions.
What Joe has been trying to communicate is that there is alot of fear with this disease.
He has sat down to eat dinner and forgotten what it is he is doing and how to do it.
He is scared of the person sitting next to him even though he has known that person forever.
We do not go out alot because he is afraid to go past the edge of the property because he may not come back.
This has made a man who would willing take on the South Side of Chicago to do his job, someone who jumps when I walk up next to him.
What we take for granted the pepole who have this disease no longer can.
Joe mentioned that I had taken a job as a caregiver.
I was taking care of a perfectly sweet couple who both had AD.
Everyday while I was there we had the same discussions.
"Where is my car?"
"Why can't I go to the bank?"
"It is not fun getting old because you get no respect from anyone."
I was sorry when I decided that I could no longer work for this company because I will miss the couple.
Try listening to your client, loved one, neighbor.
They are trying to say hear me but most of the time can't.
This is what Joe wants on the TV shows, and the newspapers, and the articles that are written about the disease.
We all know that there are people dying and we know the medical field is working on a cure for a disease that they don't know how it starts.
I have never heard of brain cells regenerating.
But then I don't have a degree.This is the story that needs to be told.And if it sounds like he is kvechting so be it send him some cheese and crackers.
He'll love it.Lynn

I received the following email from my mother-in-law.
So I thought rather than being a pain in the ass today, that comes later, we would have a little humor, at least i found it so.
Have you ever  wondered what the difference is between Grandmothers  and Grandfathers?
Well, here it is: There was this loving  grandfather who always made a special effort to spend time with his son's  family on weekends.
Every Saturday morning he would take his 7-year-old granddaughter out for a drive in the car for some quality time -- just  him and his granddaughter.
One particular Saturday, however, he had a  bad cold and really didn't feel like being up at all.
He knew his  granddaughter always looked forward to their drives and would be  disappointed.
Luckily, his wife came to the rescue and said that she  would take their granddaughter for the drive.
When they returned, the  little girl anxiously ran upstairs to see her grandfather who was still in bed.
"Well, did you enjoy your ride with grandma?"
he asked.
"Oh, yes,  PapPap, it was really wonderful.
We didn't see a single  asshole, blind bastard, dipshit or son of a bitch anywhere we  went!"
Almost brings a tear to your eye, doesn't  it?
God Bless & Keep You & This Country of Ours!!!!!
joe PS> God love grandpa's to.

Let's start with how Joes' day goes.
He gets up and goes in and turns on the computer.
We moved it upstairs after our son moved out.
Then he goes down and feeds and waters the bird.
, takes his meds.
That may or may not tire him out so he will sit and most likely fall asleep sitting on the couch.
On Fridays that is towel day.
He gathers all the towels in the house and washes, dries and puts them away.
This could take anywhere from an hour and a half to all day because he has forgotten that he started them, and most likely will sleep again.
He has his tacquitos several times in a day or not depending on wheter or not he remembers if he is hungry.
We all ask him if he wants anything.
Then there are the times that he is staring off into space and you ask if anything is wrong and  he shrugs and says Ehh.
Yesterday I asked him and he said that he was tired and did not care anymore.
He wants to go home.
It is getting harder for him to get his thoughts across and out to us.
We play alot more charades.
It is a good thing I know how his brain works or we would never have a conversation.I think that is enough for now and will do more later.Take careLynn

As readers of this thing, I would lkei to know what it is you want to hear about from me.
I feel like I have reached a point on constatnntly reapeting myself.
True or not I do not know.
My wife informs me we are in 2011, well I still am back in 2009 I think, because time does not seem to have moved forward for me or I have not gone with it.
Maybe that is good, you all are getting older and I am staying the same.
What a horrible thought that means I have to stay where I am at.
I do not like where I am at, i dont even know when someone comes or goes in my hourse or even who is here at times.
Ideas, thoughts whatever from you would help.
I did write to Dr. Phil to try and get a show on those of us who suffer, not the medical or caregiver or research side, but us the Walking Dead to hear our voice, but like the answer my wife got from Oprah, silence nothing back.
I guess we are not worth talking to or about.
No wonder so many actually just give up and call inside not to be heard from again, I can relate to that now, not before but now I can.
We are throw aways no doubt in my mind any longer.
Even my friend Dr. Sivack whose blog I invade at times no longer writes me, eveb those who are with Alz Org that are supposedly friends or want my involment , nothing just the quietness of silence.
But people have their own lives to live and deal with.
I have grown tired and wiery, take care my friends.
God Bless & Keep You & This Country of Ours!!!!

The new pic is the whole fam damily.
Wishing you all the best for the New Year and thanking you for your continued support and words.
I have having more problems with the old brain, new cells are disappering.
I now have to ask if I have eaten because I cannot remember.
It is getting harder for me to tell you things and keep it kind of level.
My reality is no longer what it was.
I have come to a thought that AD is a number of types of dementia which would I think explain why we all progress differently and caring signs of different so called stagess at one time.
I find that I sshake more violently now even typing, just time moves.
My brain has just blanked out.

             Thank You!
Dear Joe, Soon, we expect President Obama to sign the National Alzheimer's Project Act into law.
This is the largest legislative victory in many years for the Alzheimer cause, and you made it happen.
We look forward to working with all of the various agencies to ensure this law is enacted in the spirit in which it was drafted.
With a new Congress convening in January, we're eager to build on the momentum from this victory and hope that you'll join us.
As we prepare to launch our 2011 legislative priorities we are asking you to please consider making a donation so we can continue the fight against Alzheimer's disease.
A donor has graciously stepped forward and offered to match all gifts made to the Alzheimer's Association by December 31, 2010, up to $10,000.
So we need your support now to allow us to continue our efforts to advance research, as well as vital care and support programs in the upcoming year.
As leaders in the fight against Alzheimer's disease, you already know the stark realities:5.3 million.
Americans who are currently living with this disease, with that number expected to skyrocket to as many as 16 million by mid-century.
January 1, 2011.
That's when the first baby boomer hits the age of 65, entering into an age of increased risk for developing Alzheimer's.
0.
The number of people today with access to a means to prevent, cure or even slow the disease.
Yet our nation has lacked a national strategy to address this crisis.
Thanks to your help, that stops now.
Throughout this year you have called on Congress, written the President, and signed the Alzheimer's Breakthrough Ride Petition to ask that our nation address this crisis.
You made a difference and soon our nation will make a commitment to fighting this disease.
Thank you for all that you do and Happy Holidays.
Sincerely, Robert Egge Vice President of Public Policy Alzheimer's Association              The Alzheimer's Association is the leading voluntary health organization in Alzheimer care, support and research.
Our mission is to eliminate Alzheimer's disease through the advancement of research; to provide and enhance care and support for all affected; and to reduce the risk of dementia through the promotion of brain health.

Yes a victory to a point, I am not sure what.
But I want you to pay particular attention to the part I highlighted in RED.
How many times have I said the same.
When do you folks raise your voices, This is a Call To Arms.
We the Walking Dead need your voice to be heard loud and clear and without stopping.
God Bless & Keep You & This Country of Ours!

Hello to all as we near the end of this year.
I am still in February I have no idea where the rest of this time has gone or what has happended.
As some of you know I attend a 12 step group and have for centuries to fight my disease of alcohol and am still sober some 37 years.
I was at a ongoing meeting on Christmas Eve, we have what they call marathon meetings around certain holidays to add extra support, what made this special to me and has caused me to wonder if we have the stages of AD right, yes we have it starts and you die correct, but the inbetween seeems to be not so straight forward.
I know I have written on my blog the stages, others have, Alz Org has, but you folks, my experience and what happended Christmas Eve tell me in my mind at least that there is no set inbetween stages actually, that we experience similiar things to a greater or lesser degree as suffers.
I man shared at the meeting that his father had passed in the last week from AD and he was happy for him and said how he felt.
I fortunately had the oppportunity to talk with the gentleman after the meeting, hugged him and told him I was glad his dad had been set free.
We looked at each other and I know he was confused, hell I know that feeling, so I gave him my card that has my book info on it.
We talked about how his dad was diagnosed about 3 years ago with it, for most of the time he was level had some problems then came the LINE CROSSING, 4 months ago when we knew no one and went downhill and died in the 4 month period from AD.
He and I feel the same if we can prevent ourselves (he does not have it yet) from getting to that line to end it before.
He saw the suffering of his father and the destruction on the family and does not want to go through that or put the family through it.
Unfortunately his mother is at some point in the disease, where??????
Another lady joined us and told about her parents dying from AD a number of years ago and as I listened I could hear that her parents did not follow the so called stages either.
Yes they had portions of them but kind of out of order.
I see that in myself and think what master mind is comming up with this stuff.
Maybe we need to revist how the disease really progresses, the middle part, we know that it starts and then we die.
I know for me this is long, but I was very much touched and moved by these folks, I could see their suffering, but they were able to understand to a point my side.
Especially when we talked of how they could get away from it and here I was at this meeting still getting support to help me not drink and I brought along old Mr.
AD, i cannot get away from it not even a second.
Well I need to shut up, take care of yourselves and if I forget, Have A Very Happy New Year one and all.
God Bless & Keep You & This Country of Ours!!!

Hello to al I know it has been ahwile.
Lately I have been noticing that I feel more and more like I am in a fog, I am aware that I am here but I am not reallly here.
A very strange feeling.
It is like being lost but not.
I am not sure what this means except that I feel and Lynn has noticed lately that the slope has become steeper and with my round butt I am sliding a little quciker.
The article I was in posted on my blog, had errors and I have tried to get the corrected but of course neither the writter Lillian Cox or the Editor of the Coast News has had the well less than knowing someithing nice to say the balls to contact me back.
We met with someone from the San Diego chapter of the Alz Org awhile ago about getting involved and geting us a voice, boy they are just as quiet.
They say I think it goes, "Silence is Golden", if that is the case the deafening silence I am getting from those above and from anyone outthere trying to get us a voice, my house should be sinking from the gold bars that it is loaded with.
Or at least I should be able to go to Mc Donalds for dinner.
I need to go now.
Take care of yourself.
God Bless & Keep You & This Country of Ours!!!

Thank you for sending a message to the President.
There is true strength in numbers and we need all the help we can get.
Will you take a few moments to send out the message below?
You can simply copy and paste it into a new email.
Again, thank you for your support.
Sincerely, Brendan Burns Associate Director, Advocacy Alzheimer's Association Dear Friend, As you probably know, I'm an advocate in the fight against Alzheimer's disease.
Right now there is a bill that has passed Congress that has the potential to change the course of Alzheimer's Disease.
The National Alzheimer's Project Act would launch a coordinated campaign within the federal government to overcome Alzheimer's disease.
It would create a national strategic plan for America's 6th leading cause of death with clear objectives, accountability, and timelines.
Please send a message to President Obama asking him to sign NAPA.
or go to www.alz.kintera.org/President Thank you for your support,  joseph Your message was sent to: President Barack Obama As you know, National Alzheimer's Project Act (S.3036) was recently passed by both the Senate and House of Representatives.
As an Alzheimer's Association advocate, I respectfully ask that you sign the National Alzheimer's Project Act into law without delay.
The National Alzheimer's Project Act would launch a coordinated campaign within the federal government to overcome Alzheimer's disease.
It would create a national strategic plan for America's 6th leading cause of death with clear objectives, accountability, and timelines.
NAPA establishes an inter-agency Advisory Council that will coordinate and evaluate all federal efforts on Alzheimer research, care, institutional services, and home- and community-based programs.
The national plan with outcomes, recommendations, and priority actions, must be updated and reported to Congress annually.
On behalf of the 5.3 million Americans currently living with Alzheimer's and their more than 11 million caregivers, thank you for your commitment to fighting Alzheimer's disease.
I look forward to hearing from you regarding the enactment of the National Alzheimer's Project Act.
Sincerely, Joseph Potocny 5435 Lariat Way Oceanside, CA 92057-5517 PS> We look forward to your help.

Hello to all this day.
My wife who has been my main caregiver and has been home with me for almost the last year is now working again.
She is working as a CAREGIVER, thats right and her first client, well this is jus a kick is an elderly man with, yes you got it AD.
The woman is a glutten for punishment.
She has been away now several days home in the evening and I plain do not like it.
She is my rock with this, but I guess she is needed other places as well.
I feel very uncomfortable over it.
I could bitch, but I am going to try and restrain my dislike of the matter.
Still have my mother in law here with me, but not the same.
I feel lost without Lynn.
But she is needed elsewhere at this time.
God Bless & Keep You & This Country of Ours!!!!!

Many of you may remember the HBO special, specifically "Memory The Loss Tapes".
Both my wife and I have tried to find out how each of the perssons in the film were doing.
However calling and emailing HBO brought not even a response of any kind jus SILENCE.
I know my wife will hit me upside the head for this, but I guess they got their awards and that is that.
I met these folks and they were oh so nice and greatfull for each of us letting them into our lives.
It is not the actual people that filmed the part I was in that I am miffed at (being politically correct here), but those at the top who do not seem to really care beyond their fuckin awards, sorry wife but I had to let it out.
The film had the following folks in it:  Bessie Knapmiller, Fannie Davis, Yolanda Santomartino, Josephine Mickow, Cliff Hoffman, Woody Giest and of course me.
Theough research my wife was able to find out most of the information we wanted to know.
Remember we all had been diagnosed for about the same number of years: Bessie Knapmiller  set free 2/2010 she won!
Fannie Davis: unable to find out Yolanda Santomartino: unable to find out, but her age and condition tell me she may not be with us anymore.
Josephine Mickow: set free 10/2009 she won!
Cliff Hoffman: set free April or May of 2008 before filming complete, he won!
Woody Giest: set free 3/2010 (believe this is correct) he won!
Joseph Potocny (ME): well your still stuck with me.
I have mxied emotions about my comrades, as I do not like to see anyone die, I am also happy for thsoe who won and beat this bastardly disease.
I am also jealous that I am not with them.
As for Fannie and Yolanda, I pray the Lord has you in his arms and comforting you.
I ask the families of those past on their permission to post a picture on my memory page of their loved ones and that they send me one:  jolynn1@cox.net This is for me a sad day of posting.
Take care of yourselves.
God Bless & Keep You & This Country of Ours!!!!

Here is hoping that you all had a wonderful day yesterday and stayed safe.
As for me I helped to expand my stature in life, I ate.
I had an interview with a journalist sometime this week that is doing a two part piece in the local paper here on me.
I guess she was promted by my post of Who Speaks For Us.
We discussed my anger in the posting and she cam to understand that I was not against boobs, but the fact that there really is very little media about us.
We talked about how we are throw aways.
I also expressed my disappointment in the Alz Org for not being more media concious.
Walks are great, working quietly with lawmakers to get things moving is nice, but without hard media coverage does not help that much.
NOTICE we now have a pill that will help about 70% of those who take it not to get AIDS, is that not nice for those that want same sex and needle sharing.
From about 1983 or so till now we are stopping these folks from dieing (which is great), only 25+ years to help them, of course that was media push and political movement.
But here I stand with over 5.3 million (very low estimate) with AD, and we are THE WALKING DEAD!!!!
like it or not that is the plain raw simple truth, known since 1906 well what do we have, meds that may slow things for a short time then down the hill you go.
Yes we with dementia are B movie actors, Zombies of the World, Night of the Walking Dead, etc.
Yes I am pissed.
I will stay that way and continue with your help to get us a VOICE that will not be Silenced.
Each day that butcher in my brain takes more of me, not thin tiny slices anymore but it has widened the blade and the slices arre gettting thicker.
I st5umble more, lost in conversations most of the time, sit and my brain goes off somewher and leaves the body here just fixed.
I believe that I am starting to have ciesures not the roll on the ground type but where my mind just flakes.
It is getting harder to post, the things come to my head, but get lost before I can write them and I sit here trying to figure out why I am at the computer and just get up and walk away.Everyday living is becoming a task, simple crap just is major, the fun is leaving.
I now no the rages of this disease and the loss of who people really are.
My once strong strength to concentrate so I could talk is weaking quickly and I can be pulled off subject in a second and not be able to return.
Right now, I am alone and the house is quiet, so I can talk to all of you, but it has taken since about 6 this morning to put this together.
This blog has become me and I guess my crusade to awaken people that we do exist and that they very well may join us shortlly unless there is such an out cry that people move, THIS IS NOT AN OLD PEOPLES DISEASE, there are those that were born the same year as me that are a cpl of years dead now from AD.
I am onl 66 now, stat wise about 2-4 yeras before I get the hell out of here.
Take care of yourselves and be good to each other.
God Bless & Keep You & This Country of Ours!!!
joe PS that goes for all those on this planet.

Well Good Morning World!
Yes it is me again you lucky people.
I have been puzzled, confused or whatever over something.
You caregivers out their and even you suffers can help me with this.
Ther are days that I get up and ready to take on the wolrd and my brain in on fire.
The all of a sudden i am like, Robby the robot in Forbiden Planet all my circuts start to short out and I am just plain fricken out of it.
I do not understand this, most of the time I kind of walk on eggs because I am not sure where I am or how I feel or what is taknig place in my brain.
Have any of you seen or experienced this?
It is really concerning.
Kind of like here today, gone in a minute.
Well I am 66 today, who would have thunk it, not me.
Still a pain in the ass about things.
Food no longer intersets me either.
Eat or don't eat ok by me.
The food just does not hold any enticement I think that is the world anylonger.
Things I loved to eat just do nothing for me.
I have to be reminded now or asked about eating, not part of my list today.
Oh well starting to ranble.
Take care of yourselves.

Since i went to the memmory walk here, 1st one in Oceanside, CA, which had 600 walkers so they say, the question of "Who Really Speaks For Us?"
Has been runnning in my head.
I listened to all the speakers and the walkers, cheering for a cure, what about the cause people?
I heard how everyone was helping to care for us and the rest.
But NO ONE spoke for me or the others in my world.
Where is our Voice.
Certainly not with the major companies, major sports or even really the fricken media.
Try as I may I cound not find anythin in our local paper The North County Times about it.
But the, and you may not like this but tuff, The BOOB walk on sunday drew media and papers.
It is I think as I have felt we are throw aways.
Fix them boobs, which deaths have been droping on, and I do not wish it on any woman or man (we get it to Ladies), but we have no, I repeat we have NO SURVIVORS' , THAT IS RIGHT NOT ONE!
Again, WHERE IS OUR VOICE?
I am ready for the bull mail to come take your best shot at me.
I can dish it out and I can take it back.
But if you are going to get on my ass, do it publicly with a comment.
I put out publicly and am not afraid.
I for one who suffers with this bastard of a disease, am really getting tired of everyone saying we are going forward, but yet I do not see us on the boob tube rarely.
Where are the causes?
Where are the cures?
Where is there real working drugs?
I once offered and now I offer again a CHALLENGE to any so called researcher out there my brain to use living samples from, not mice, not dead brain material, although that may be debatable in my case, to use.
I know I have been told it may leave me worse off, more demented and I may die, DAH, wath the hell is going to happen anyways.
Until my next tirade or what ever, be good to your selfs.
God Bless & Keep You & This Country of Ours!!!!

I was reading a discussion on Caregiver.com about people with AD & likes dying and the time it takes and how to handle it.
First I want to say that those who say celebrate the persons life are correct.
To that I add do not morn for that is self serving and arrogant.
Because I feel that it is only a self pitty thing, why am I alone now, they had no right, etc.
I said my good byes long ago to my family when we knew what was going on and freely talk about my passing.
Quiet frankly I cannot wait.
You see on this side of the fence we cannot escape any of the ravages in anyway but death, you can get relief and put us in homes how nice for you.
I have in hte past expressed my feelings on these things, we are still kept silent and still put away.
Well while I am alive and can I hope I promote some real thought over this home putting crap.
I kind of understand, you are 78 and the only one to cae for your loved one, home may be or is the right place.
My bitch is with the offspring, how would have it been when you got sick mom and dad just sent you away or sent you to other family members and they passed you on, because it casused extra time of your day to care.
Think about it.
I know my wife and I have been there every step of the way for our kids, sickness, catatrosphic illnesses, major accidents, arrests, drug and alcohol problesm we have seen them all but have been there, no matter how old they have gotten or how much we did not want to be involved, but they are our family and we do what families do, take care of each other.
I guess no one really hanlesd death well that remains behind, but just think of us that go ahead  of you we are set free, no more of the confusion, frustration, pain, forgettfulness, not know who or what anything or anyone is, no more diapers, rubber sheets, being hand fed or laying in bed all the time.
I am wiery of the fight and now just let it work its job so that I can win in the end by passing.
I reallly hate this feeling great and in control one moment and the nothing makes sense and seems to be real or knowing where the fuck I am or what I am doing.
I need to stop.
Take care of yourselves.
God Bless & Keep You & This Country of Ours!!!!

Maybe next time you will get your head out of your ass and use your right to vote.

As many of you know from time to time I share emails with permission.
This is one I got just recently.
You all seem to be amazed that even advancing in this fricken disease I can still communicate.
I want you to know that all of us with AD or other forms of dementia are not always stumbling, bumbling and drooling people.
Some to the end, not many still reamin mentally strong, maybe not physically but one cannot have everything.
Also this email may give you a hint of why I take no meds for AD, just mood stabilizers, the shit does not work if that helps.
************** Dear Joe and Lynn,   Thank you again for your response...these letters and blogs must keep you both very busy...I don't know how Joe still does it, but thank you from the bottom of my heart.
My father suffered from AD silently...we did not know what he was thinking or feeling...he tried to live life as if he didn't have the disease, including not talking about it.
The only glimpses we had were his physical struggles, his hallucinations, and listening to his frustrations...we had to try to fill in ourselves what was going on in his head.
Joe, you have no idea how much your shared words help us understand what you are feeling or experiencing or thinking...more than you know.
I wish my father could have expressed what he was experiencing, but he didn't, so I am learning from you.
I just checked into your blog...I am sorry to say that I haven't been able to keep up with it regularly (due to restricted internet access), but every time I visit your page, it brings tears to my eyes...I am just filled up with sentimental emotion on how much you share, and your struggles doing it, and your struggles with the disease...thank you for all the work you put in.
I am amazed at how articulate you still are at this stage.
I am so happy you published a book!!!!
That's great.
I unfortunately could not find the memorial link on your page...I must be overlooking it.
But I would love to send you the information on my father, and a photo.
I will let my mother know.
I was also thrilled to hear that you are doing the Memory walk in Oceanside.
Before I knew that, I was going to e-mail and ask if you and/or your family if you and they might be interested because I want to do it too.
But I have to get my butt in gear to sign up and send out the e-mails.
My mother did the walk in Florida about a week or two ago.
I'll honor my father with a team bearing his name; however, I do not have family here, so unless friends join me (and they might), I might be a team of one.
I would be honored to walk with you and Lynn if you like.
It sounds like you might not have many walking with you, so if you and Lynn need any help at all, I would be happy and honored to help.
I helped give care to my father until he passed.
This is getting long for you to read, so I will sign off.
If you want to put any of this last response on your blog, you have my permission.
God bless you all (and my father would have agreed with Joe on "...and this great country of ours")   Cheryl ________________________________God Bless & Keep You & This Country of Ours!!
!joePS Cheryl has no real idea what emails and comments from you folks really mean to me.
They keep me wanting to post, even though I feel no one really gives a shit.

I have added a link to my book for those who are interested.
At present it is only available is soft & hard cover.
Within the next 2-4 weeks so i am told it will be available in electronic format for you Kindle folks.
At That time the bugger will be available at Amazon.com & BarnesandNoble.com, as well as my website and other locations.
Now that, that is out of the way, today sucks, I am having trouble getting things from my brain cell to my mouth or fingers and once it gets there they don't know what to do with it.
I feel like i am starting to reepet my self more and more.
My family bless them say its ok dad we know.
I sure would like to know what it is that they know because I do not.
Doing this blog is getting difficult.
I have these grand things, I think to say and my brain farts them away.
I have problems with titles that have antynig to do with the post.
I think, that is a joke that their maybe no more titles.
How does one tell you how uttterlly difficult it is living in this World that I am now in.
Cann't drive, cann't balance check book anymore, forget my pills, forget the bills and now I get up from the table leaving my dinner because I forgot I was eating.However my bowels and I still are on the same page, way to often, but still together.
You take care now.

This is to say thank you.
My book has gone to print today and should be available at least electronically in 48 hours we hope.
It is Titled:                                            Living with Alzhiemers'                                           (A Conversation If You Will) So titled because you all have played a part in it.
Whether is sells 1 copy or not is not what counts to me, the fact that it has beens something I wanted to do and Thanks to All of You, it has come about.
When I get the location for you to look and decide I will post it, quickly if I remember.
Lynn will probably beat me until I do.
God Bless & Keep You & This Country of Ours!!!!!
joe PS> Thanks Dr. Sivak for your support.

Well Joe is trying hard to keep up with things but they are getting away from him.
He is working with the people with the book and it is taking a toll.
He gets frustrated with things and I don't blame him.
You give explicit instructions and they don't follow them.
Well he will keep trying.
We can be in the middle of a conversation and he drops off to sleep or he talks to someone else in his head.
He is taking alot more naps lately.
He is going to try and do the memory walk with us on Nov. 6.
It is one mile from the pier by the beach and one mile back.
I told him we would pick him up on the way back if he can't make it.
The grandkids might walk it with us and my mother will be there too.
So things are moving along here.

Yes I have been answering some posts on a site called Caring.Com, yes for so called experts and in my opinion some real whiny caregivers, but a good place for most of you to go for your help and discussion needs.
Links will be on the side of my blog after this posting.
You all know how direct I am, so expect to be, being asked not to post anymore.
I have not held back anything in my postings, to so called experts and the poor little itsy bitsy caregivers.
Wine, need crackers & cheese.
Come on this side of the fence, we have nowhere to go to escape except when we DIE, You can tell the discussion I got in really pissed me off.
But that is the way it is.
I doubt how long I will still be able to post, we are entering that wild downward ride side.
I loose people in conversations and sit idle at the dinner table so I am told and frankly I no longer remember yesterday, let alone this morning.
Till next tirade be good to yourselves and check the new links.

Believe it or not days I post generaly are not good.
Because I start with what I want to post and it just runs out of the brain.
It feels like a TV getting good picture and suddleny fuzz, static funny voices, it is realy frustrating.
Well a copuple of days ago we got a new evaluation on where I am, like it really helps me because I never know anyway.
We have moved right along to Early Stages of Severe Alzheimer's.
Bastard moves fast, but that is the way it is.
New links will be coming and a site added to help you caregivers speak out to each other more to come, I just need to re read emails and get my butt in gear.
Thanks for being there for me and part of the family.
God Bless & Keep You & This Country of Ours!!!

While this is still in my brain cell, the wife and I were talking last night, we are strange we do that.
We were discusing yesterday and tomorrow.
To me there is no longer a tomorrow, it does not exsit and she asked me if I wanted it to come and I said not really or something like that.
It just seems that tomorrow does not matter anylogner to me.
Yesterday, well that is not 24 hours ago to me, but it seems like centuries and having no meaning.
Lynn says I am in a time warp, who knows.
All I know or thik I know is that time for me is right now, not 10 minutes from now or past just right now.
It is a strange feeling, I guess my 1/2 brain cell is on overload.
I got a comment from a young lady in Romania and she was worried about her English.
Well is was perfect and really young one, this is not the place to worry about it.
As you read you will see what I mean.
I welcome you and the other new folks I have heard from to this World of Mine.
You never know waht will come out of my brain, and neither do I.
God Bless & Keep You & This Country of Ours!!!!

Well I am back today.
Hope you all are well.
My day is a bit foggy and slow, but that is how things go.
It is cool and rainy here, rain part very unusual for us, but welcomed.
Now tehn since you have wiated with great anticipation, pounding hearts and sweaty palms here is what is going on.
First can you guess why the title to this post?
Bet your wrong.
Living With Alzhiemer's (A Conversation if You Will), is in the process of being published.
All of you have made this possible and have contributed in one way or another to it.
Hopefully it will be out before xmas 2355, you know how slow and forgetful I can get.
The Book as it is called, is not a novel or such, it is our conversation we have had over the last 4 years I think.
Completely unedited and to the point.
Yes it is this blog in print, comments and all, except the side materials as they appear.
So to you all Thank You, for your support, caring, sharing and just being there as I make this journey.
God Bless & Keep You & This Country of Ours!

I was told do not shoot the refrigerator.
Last hunting trip it was still alive and well.
I just look straight in and not at the botoom creatures.
They call but I do not listen I just hear them, kind of like your kids do.
Went and saw my shrink today and we changed meds again, or actually I did.
Told him the last stuff he gave me I think it was lats month was at the hazardous waste dump.
It ripped my system apart.
Back on the old stuff, feeling fine, except have to get the old poop train back on track and the fund dissolver as well.
having fun refinishing a cedar chest, of course my friened Bobby had to sand the thing, otherwise it would have had mountain ranges and gorges in it.
He did a beautiful job on the sanding.
Yess my staining and varnishing shills are excellent except the stuff makes me loopy, just what I need.
To all of you who visit here and leave your comments, I deeply appreciate them.
You who claim to have nothing to say, I say bull, HELLO works well.
Nothing important to add, the fact that you stop by, say hello or whatever is important to me and the rest of this world family we have created.So do not be shy.
God Bless & Keep You & This Country of Ours!!!!!

I have been trying to think how to say this...
I am angry.
I am royally ticked off at this disease.
I am ticked that I do not have the man that I married anymore.
Yes I understand that I am not the same person that he married and that we all change.
That is how it is supposed to be, but this is different.
They lose themselves and we lose them.
I got my haircut over the weekend and Joe has asked me twice now if I got my haircut.
I can't take my frustration out on the guy who cuts me off on the road, I can't yell at the broad who runs the stop signs in our neighborhood,(well I can but it does not do any good),there is no one to lay the blame on when Joe is sitting and wondering where he is or who he is talking to.
I try not to get frustrated with him when he is in a foul mood because he does not know what is going on.
I can't yell at him because he does not always understand why I am angry because he doesn't know that he is aggravating me because he who used to make snap decisions now can't decide what he wants to have for lunch.
He takes naps at the drop of a hat and leaves right in the middle of a conversation.
Not physically but mentally.
We were talking about some stuff the other day and he asked if I was disappointed about something and my response was not disappointed but I have to learn to understand that it is what it is.
Our lives are all about that now.
When you come to grips with the fact that this is what we have to deal with it does bring a little peace.
Not alot but just a little.
And there will still be those times that I may lose my patience but I need to remember that  "It is what it is".

A few years ago we had the kitcehn remodeled.
New Honey Oak Cabinets, with black nobs with dark cherry wood centers, the walls in a chocolate color, and a Brazilian Cherry Hardwood Floor, Black Stove & Microwave and a Black & Stainless Steel Dishwasher.
Then there sat6 are very old but working fine White Refrigerator.
So for years you know who has been bitching for one to match, yes me.
Well we just purchased a new one.
Reasons, much more energy efficient then are 15 year old one, quieter, it has crushed ice a must for me, but most importantly it is BLACK and matches the decor.
Happy am I, yes, except for opening it.
You see the last one the bottom drawers were solid and you could not see what was in them.
This one they are CLEAR and you see everything.
So what you say, well let me tell you there are creatures in those bins.
I open the door and they stare at me, I know they want me.
I cannot look at them, sill y yess, but that is how my brain reacts to them.Lynn just says Joe, get over yourself and deal with it.
Not so simple, things like this are creeping into my life now and I can only wonder what lies ahead.
The part of my brain that still understands logic laughs at me, but there is that growing part that sees and witnesses strange things and seems to have more control.
The stuff in thre drawers seems to have eyes and moves when I look at it, not anyone else, just me and that is what really counts is how I feel about it.Well I guess I will just have to outfit myself for hunting when I go to the refrig that way I am prepaired for any attack.
Thank you all for being here for me.
God Bless & Keep You & This Country of Ours!!

Here is a link about possible preventive things against Alzheimer's: http://www.newsmaxhealth.com/headline_health/breakthroughs_Alzheimers/2010/09/17/350866.html?s=al&promo_code=AC7C-1 You be the judge of this.
I think you will know my demented thoughts on this.
The gene one only covers to my understanding maybe 5% of people who get AD.
I would really like to know how they determine that the one's that did not get AD, would not have gotten it anyway.
Stats can mean what you want them to.

I am still amazed at this point that I can still converse with you and tell you how things are going in my journey or battle if you will.
In the beginning and still now i am prepared for the mental walkings and goings but I was never prepaired for the physical problems.
Walking with a swagger, actually kind of a stumble and hunched, feeling icky most of the time, getting exttermely upset around people and sweaty like a pig, shaking like i do, not able to hold things all the time, just not ready for this crap.
I find my world in fading in and out now.
I recognize family and people and suddenly they start to become someone else.
Same person standing there but my brain seems to switch off and step back and say who the fuck is that.
I am finding this to be happening more and more, I feel like i am fading away from Joe and going somewhere and I cannot stop it anylonger.
I really wish I would hear from others in this world of mine and what they are going through and how they feel.
It is really a lonely place, yes I have people around me that care and help, not the same, they are not here with me, in my reality such as it is.
I must go now my mind is confused and i am getting very angry.
God Bless You & This Country of Ours!

Just so all of you understand, we remodeled a few years ago.
Things were in an uproar then and we have not done any remodeling in the house lately.
We just painted the patio outside and have been working on his ponds for the last year.
So where there was at one time alot of things going on it has died down alot.
Joe has even mentioned that it seems that we have come to a standstill on doing things around here.
It is just recently that he has mentioned that he is not comfortable in the downstairs of the house.
He will go up to watch tv at 8 at night and stay awake until 2 or 3.
I do not know what is going on with this new emotion.
He has his space at the ponds but in the house it is the sanctuary of our room that he seems to be the most comfortable.
It is completely opposite of what he used to do.
Joe would love to change things.
We would paint or move stuff and then it was time to start over again.
The house always needed to change and so did he.
Not so anymore.
Joe would like to do stuff but then when it comes time to do it he backs off.
The same for going out.
He has a hard time just going out with me to the store.
Part if the problem is physically being able to walk without to much problem and the other is the fact that there are so many people around.
We were in the store a while back and I let him go down one aisle looking for something and when he walked sown the aisle that I was in he looks right at me and continued on, he came back to the aisle and said I know you.
Little scary.
So I have to not let him go because even though he seems ok when we are together it is the what happens when we are not together that is scary.
But try and tell him that.
It comes back down to them wanting to prove that they can still do things the old way.
So once again it is good luck with who you have.
I do believe that change is not a good thing with these guys and that the more stable and calm things are the better.
Take care Lynn

I have come to belive that waking up is not all that it is cracked up to be.
It seems that I never seem to wake up completely anymore.
I more or less remain is a state of awakeness if that is a word, if not it is now.
I just never seem to quite get with it anymore.
I am becoming much more testier and argumentative, wow I think I spelled that right.
Time is more jumbled now then ever before and I have more difficult in getting things out and what the hell i do no t know what i whant to say here.
I no longer enjoy being downstairs in my home, only outside in the front or back or upstairs, i do not know what it is, i am very uncomfortable now.
We just spent I do not remember how much when remodeling downstairs the way we wanted it and I do not want to be down there now.
I do not understand me anymore.
Lynn wants me to talk to her and I cannot even talk to myself.
Hell I always talked to myself, I was the only one that had the answers I wanted to hear now I cann't think of them.
Well take care for now.

The following comment deserves to be used as a post.
This is what I have tried to get others that were invited as posters to do.
I share my side, you share yours.
Anonymous   has left a new comment on your post "About the parboiling":  Good morning Lynn and Joe.
I can certainly relate to this situation.
Unfortunately, memory is not the only effect of this disease but also logic,reasoning, and EGO are noticably effected.
We have one and a half acres of lawn which we have a good sized tractor for mowing.
My husband refuses to allow me to mow with the tractor and always says that I wouldn't be able to handle it.
The truth is I used to do the mowing with the tractor but he claims that he doesn't remember that I ever did.
The truth has come out that he really feels it is the one thing he still does and doesn't want me taking over it.
We have fought and fought over this over recent years now and I can't seem to win.
His abilities to maneuver and control the tractor are noticably impared but I still cannot get him to concede to allow me to do the mowing.
He is aware that he has problems with doing the mowing and procrastinates just as long as he possibly can.
The best plan that I have come up with is to use the hand mower to cut the two areas that are potentially dangerous with the tractor.
When I first started doing this he even continued to take the tractor over the same areas that I had already mowed just because he resented the idea that I felt it was something he could no longer do.
I just can't seem to get across to him that just having him safe and uninjured by my side day after day is so much more important to me than him proving to himself that he can still do certain things.
I think we could all benefit from hearing from others who have faced these challenges and how they were able to successfully navigate through these types of situations.
Thank God Joe's experience was his parboiled fanny and not a fall from the roof!
I pray that my husband's experience will only be damage to his tractor and not to his body.
May God bless us and guide us through our journey of life, whatever it brings our way!

First of all let me tell everyone that I was totally against him going on the roof.
I have been doing the roof projects for a long time now and I could not stop him.
I asked him why  he felt he needed to do it and the response was He needed to prove to himself that he was still able to do things like this.
So we put on his tennis shoes for better grip and tucked in his pants legs and boy did he look ducky.
And he did not go up very high just a couple of feet and as the water came down the roof he remembered that the roof was warm and so was his behind.
I guess what the point of all this is, is even though they have this coming on they want to feel useful around the house and that they need to feel wanted and needed.
Joe still does things around the house.
He has his daily routine, feed the fish, bird and take out the recyclable stuff piled up on the counter.
He has taken over doing the towels once a week and heaven help us if we interfere.
(He takes them out of the dryer and puts them on so he can warm up).
So if your loved one or patient can do some chores around the house let them as long as they do not pose a danger to themselves or others.
I am sure there are some things they can do such as feeding animals or folding laundry.
You will figure it out.
But the roof is probably a bad idea.
Joe won't be going up there again.Take careLynn

Yes yours truly master of home repairs and as dense as a tree was at it again today.
One needs to know that me and ladders do not belong in the same universe, I get on one and by the time I reach the second step on it I am 30 pounds lighter.
Today we started on clean the outside of the house, redoing the pation and th driveway.
Well do to my immense brain power I got on the roof to wash down the roof and upstairs portion of the house.
Well sitting on the roof was a bit on the hot side.
Did you know that when you spray down a roof that the sun has been beating down on the water turns to steam, well I do now.
As this small river came rushing down the roof towards my secure spot, it reached my butt, yess my backside, and it cooked it.
I felt like I was sitting ing boiling water, guess what DAH i was.
I am fighting this disease the best I can, but the longer we go down the road, the more I find out what I do not know that I thought I knew, before I found out that I did not have the first idea about it.
Lately when I get up I am not able to finish crossing that bridge from sleep to being fully awake.
I was talking with my ologist this week and he asked if I felt like I was is a fog.
Well the answer is yes, the above is proof of that.Things are just not clear to me any more and I stop more in the middle of things then I did before and wind up doing something else.
Each day I decide to write on here and say I should write things down before I post so I remeber what it is that I want to say.
GREAT IDEA, problem is I sit down to do it and forget what it was I was going to do, welcome to dreamland.
Well I need to stand right now so you all be good to yourselves and THANK You for helping me win the new award posted on our blog.
This is your victory as well.
God Bless & Keep You & This Country of Ours!!!!

I wonder sometimes if I have any brains left or if they are just trains runnnning in a circle.
Things to me seem to be getting fuzzier each day.
I forget mor of what I am going to do each day.
Wife is up North visiting daughter and kids, I just could not take going after her 50th a week or so ago.
I found 32 good reasonss to commit homicide that day, way too much noise, movement, people, just a real grate on my brain, nerves and patience.
I am glad to see the going back and forth in comments and Lynn's posting.
We got one the other day that we discussed and both of us for diffferent reasons.
She could understand the people resenting the fact that the parents who are becoming a problem and like me, living another 5 or more years.
Lynn feels that way about me at times and we both think it is normal and good to express it.
You need time away from us guys to help yourselves.
See I look at it that I may have to put up with those arround me hovering, checking, watching ever annoying me even for another year.
I wish they would just disappear at times.
I think both sides feel this way, have to, we with Dementia are really a handfull, I think worse than trying to raise baby tripplets.
See have the time I do not know what I want or what I am doing, just like a kid.
I want to say welcome to all of you that visit my blog.
From Russia, US, Canada, Latvia, China, Brazil, Austrailia, etc., it boggles my brain cell.
Thank you all for visiting.
I hope to be adding new resources to the list on the side soon for you all.

I have added a new link, Nursing Home Abuse, for those of you that may have problems with a nursing home or need help in finding and how to look for one.
Do hope that this will be of help.
I am glad to see the comments of help going back and forth, this will help you I think and hope.
This is what this blog has been waiting for.
Out of the avg of 179 people that visit each day, I think some of you have great wisdom to offer each other.
For me, getting better is not taking place, getting worse is and will till it kills me.
You all know I just love the medical profession and researchers with great and profound moranity.
I got a mailer the other day, Alhzeimers cured and the cause, medical book supposedly.
AD caused by lack of insulin in other words diabetes of the brain.
The gist is that extra insulin can halt or even reverse the damage.
A lot of quacks out there, amazing that this one dr. has found this out and has not shared it with the medical community but is with the world.
I think I will go have to cokes so the caffine stops my AD.
I need some help or at least to know if any one with AD out there or caregivers have noticed this happening: For a cpl of months now I have been experienncing pain in the brain, this is not a headache or migrane as one knows them to be.
It is like someone with really big hands is reachin inside my skull and just squeezing the hell out of my one brain cell, trying to make it smaller.
This can last for hours to days, even longer once it is gone I notice that more of me is gone.
I guess the details I follow because of my employment was in the field of computers and data gathering and details, still with me to a degree.
Have talke to my shrink and pyhsycologist about this and get a dumb look.
So you folks my family if you have any info on this I sure would like to know about it, I feel alone enough now without being the only one with this bull shit.

I think that Anonymous has hit it right on the head.
There are times that I want to wring the old guys neck.
I love him and always will but he can be such a pill that it he is hard to take.
But then he would dearly love for all of us to take a hike and not come back because we bug him.
Two way street.
I have not wanted to write on the blog because I am a private person and Joe has put us out here.
So I guess that in the long run if it helps one of you out there, so be it.
I understand the not happy caretaker thing.
Joe and I have had a few problems lately and I have walked out of the house a few times and I probably will a few more before this is over.
I have promised him that I will let him know when I am leaving now because the last time I left for 20 min.
he left and we did not know where he was for an hour until the park rangers found him.
I was even on the phone with the police.
Scary times.
Our kids say things will get better but I feel that things will only get different.
Better will be when we do not have any more worries or fights.
I cry alot too.
You really are not as alone as you think.
I have not coped with this as well as it seems.
I am learning though that there are others out here that feel as I do  and I guess that is what this blog is all about.
Please keep reading and posting when you can or care too.
Our stories are so close, Joe hates to go out and I wait for him to decide what he wants to do, we tell each other that we love each other when we are awake to do so.
Forget it at night.
I do believe that he is grateful that I am around, but I do not expect him to say it.
Just holding hands sometimes is enough.
Take care and enjoy those moments when he is truly with you.Lynn

Anonymous   has left a new comment on your post "talking it out":  Hi there Lynn & Joe.
You two sound like such a perfect couple.
I'm sorry to say that I am not feeling that way about my husband and I.
My spouse is 17 years older than me.
He was diagnosed about the same time as Joe and yes, he seems to be experiencing relatively the same stages that Joe is going through.
But I must confess, I am not feeling like the pleasant, let me make you feel better caregiver right now.
The TV can only be on one of the two channels he chooses, Fox News or the Weather Channel and he doesn't even watch them.
He, like you Joe, stares off into space.
I try to strike up any type of conversation by commenting about what they have just shown on TV but he wasn't watching it and has no idea what they were talking about.
Then he gets angry with me because he is confused about my comments.
Lately, he is always crankey and YELLING at me and our extended family (5 children, 6 grandchildren) so they don't seem to come around anymore.
I do go to work part time but he is insistant that I not leave him for more than a few hours at a time and demands that I not go anywhere away from him for any type of enjoyment.
He doesn't even want me to go shopping to get things that we need, only to the grocery store a half mile away.
He makes me feel guilty that he is afraid he will die alone and that I must be with him at all times.
And I don't mean just at our home, he insists I be in the same room with him ALL the time.
People say to me that I should get out and do things for myself.
I agree.
But the reality of life is that other people don't include you when they know you have to be home with your spouse all the time.
They don't want to be the cause of his anger either.
So here I sit feeling so all alone in the same room as him.
I provide his meals, cut his hair, do the grocery shopping, take care of our expenses and accounts, pick up his prescriptions, do his laundry and clean up after him.
He refuses to go ANYWHERE.
Will not leave the house and wants me to do the same.
I do understand that what he is going through is very difficult.
But there is never any expression of gratitude or even acknowledgement that this is difficult for me to go through also.
He used to tell me every night when we went to bed that he loved me, but even that has gone.
Now I only seem to be the object of his anger and frustration.
But all the same, I will keep on keeping on.
I won't give up, but it does help to have an outlet to release my feelings, even if it is to someone I have never met and never will.
Joe, please give Lynn a hug and let her know how much you love and appreciate her.
Sounds like you have a real piece of gold to hang on to through this journey we all pass through.
My love to you both.
The above is a comment shared on this blog in respose to a posting by my wife Lynn, who I am 16 years older than.
This lady is suffering just as Lynn is, I have become very combative, pig headed, a dick, paranoid and more withdrawn.
I have asked many of you to be guest bloggers for the above very reason.
I cannot tell you how many 100's of emails I have received just like the above comment.
See all I can respond to these people is that I am sorry for your mate and you, but it is only going to get worse, a lot of comfort right, wrong, but it is the truth.
I ask again that you help with posting.
See even if you do the same thing everyday, you still do something a little different and that little difference could help someone like this lady.
Me i love and appreciate your words of encouragement, but really they are gone as soon as I read them.
You see I know that I will not get better only worse and it is doing that quite well.
I am on a journey to keep an appointment with mental collapse and physical death that is the reality of it.
It sucks, i hate how i feel, i do not like my distrust and disgust with others, but my emotions are no longer mine, I even do not feel bad anymore when I am a real pain in the ass or hurt feelings, my brain says tough crap to you.
I hear and see things now that are not there, i do not even know when I am being talked to.
Sex keeps rolling in my brain but the old pecker does not help out and I even say who the hell caaares to taht.
I am getting like my good friend Dr. Joe Savick, making a 42 paragraph post.
Thanks for listening shit has hjust built up in me and while I am thinking of it I am making this post.
God Bless & Keep You & This Country of Ours.
Joe

<doc date=Saturday, July 24, 2010>
Joe just told me about the lady in the previous post.
So here's to helping her at least dog paddle.
Joe does not talk alot about how he is feeling anymore and as he puts it I  nag.
It is not so much nagging but wanting in to his thoughts so I can understand what he is thinking and how he is feeling.
Yes I know he does not know what he is thinking alot of the times but when he does it is really good.
So I am relegated to asking only once a say certain questions such as  "what's on your brain?"
To which the answer is usually mud, eh, or I forget.
I have to ask specifically about how he is feeling to a body part.
If I ask in general I can only ask once a day.
So if I know his fingers hurt or his head hurts I ask specific questions.
I also have learned how to ask the same question in different ways but he is catching on.
So he will ask me if I have already asked that for the day.
And don't be afraid to say  hey it's not my fault I am here for you but let me in once in a while.
I need   to know how he is feeling so that I am prepared to help with either just holding his hand or letting him be on his own.
Even though they have this problem going on in their heads they still need alone time too.
Hope this helps a little.Lynn

For the last couple weeks I have been considering not posting any longer since ther did not seem to be any response to anything I posted.
Especially yelling at you my extended family for not using the tools given to you.
I guesss as we move forward I will become less tolerant and more bitchy.
My wife will probably say I have already made it ther.
I know I am more withdrawn and really don't care much about things, even my KOI ponds.
The book here "When Can I Go Home?
", i got to read before it came out.
See Dr. Joe is a friend of mine, even though he is a Phsyciahtrist, i cann't speel, that does not make him bad.
It is a pretty good book for caregivers to read I think.
Here is why I asked so many of you to become posters on this blog: Message = Just found your blog and it is great.
It might be a good help for me to understand my husband.
He does not talk much about what he feels and when he does he yells.
I try to listen but how do I get him to talk without being so mean?
He has alzheimer's and was only diagnosed a few years ago but it seems that he is slipping more these days.
I hope your troubles are few.
You look like a fun guy.Forget the last sentence.
I get a great deal of emails from people like this lady.
I can only answer from my side.
She needs help fro you guys, you can see she is drowning in a sea she does not know how to swim in.
Please POST and help her.
This is part of my reason for not wanting to continue to post.
I feel that we as a family are failing people like this lady.
My emotions control me now rather than the other way around.
Even if you do the same thing each day I am sure you do something different, maybe a minute that can help someone.
I do the same thing each day, become more forgetful, angry, frustrated, pissed, fingers hurt typing all of this, my brain wanders while I am tyring to post.
If you want to be a guest blogger on my blog, send me your email address and why and I will email you the link.
Postings have to be all related to Dementia in anyform or caregibing to Dementia patients.God Bless & Keep You & This Country of Ours (Help The World Too)!

I greet you this day not really knowing why.
It seems that the days are starting to have little meaning anymore.
I try to keep a sense of humor about things, but there is nothing humorous about what is happening to me or those around me.
I find myself staring off into space or just at nothign these days nore amd more.
Things seem to mean little anymore to me and I just do not know how to handle these feeelings and moods.
Things keep slipping farther and farther away from me.
I have tried to make this blog as time has gone by a place for meeting and exchangin thoughts and felings on dementia in general.
I gave the site a chat room for a year that I paaid for open 24/7 for whoever wanted to talk not just to me but to others a failure.
I opened a direct chat line to communicate whichcost me over$80 a month so we could talk, 5 people, a failure.
I invited over 25 people to blog here because of their involvement with dementia, that has been a failure, I even set up Yahoo Messenger for instant chatting that too went down the tubes, I even have tried skype without any success.
Comments I have gotten, emails I have gotten, but I guess my expectations (premeditated resentments) should not have been.
I have removed all of the about except comments and email.
I am trying to give u articles as I find them that maybe of interest.
I have a feeling that will be of no avail.
Bitter yes I am, angry and pissed, yes, at those who come and cannot even take time to comment yes, but most of all at ME, for especting and planning and most of all trying to plan the outcome.This fricken disease plays a lot of games with your head and sometimes I am not even sure of what I am writting, minutes from now I will forget and I guess for me that is ok. Keeping my angry under anytype of control is getting difficult, increase in meds is not helping, well so much for my bitching, like most things it will get me nowhere fast.
God Bless & Keep You & This Country of Ours!!!!

A Warrior's Lament:    (by j.v.

This more reflects my wishs of today and my feelings.
I no longer like it here.
I no longer communicate with those around me well.
Most of the time I am in my own little world and do not want to be bothered by anyone.
My wife has noticed more and more that I am not with those around me.
This is not a friendly world it rather sucks.
Things I once enjoyed are a chore, getting things done takes it seems like years to me.
It feels at times like my brain is being crushed or squeezed down.
It is not a headache but a sensation of being pushed out and away.

attacked from all angles First let me wish you all a belated 4th of July!!
You know it is difficult when everyone is watching what you are doing constantly.
OH of course the wife does not watch over me or nag, not the kids either, THEY have trained the fricken bird and cat to do their dirty work.
I am surprised they have not given the fish feet and artificial living tanks so that they can come and spy as well.
It has gotten so that I have no privacy under constant surveliance like a member of the KGB, well they won't catch me, my brain cell is working out a plan.
As soon as it lets me know what the hell it is then I can do something about this invasion.
Seriously they need to watch me, I do some of the dumbest things, besides not letting the wall get out of my way before I walk into it.
There are times I really do not know what the hell I am doiing or what I am talking about.
This is geetting more difficult as time goes on and it is suppose to, but it sure plays hell with what i want to do, which I do not know what that is to start with.
Yes there has been joy this year two new grandchildren, my new koi pond, which I rarely sit by anymore, actually two ponds.
all have mosiquto fish in them, cute little devils they are and do they populate.
Well I guess I have bitched enough, well maybe not, but at least I remembered most of what I wanted to say in this post, which in and of itself is something.
My physcologist would say that I am still in there somewhere, but the question is where.
He has been seeing me and been my friend for a number of years now, his father died from this damned disease, so he knows from where my anger and confusion and thoughts come from.
God Bless & Keep You & This Country of Ours!!
joe PS: I can go anywhere I want, that is what I am told, but here is the kicker I have to be taken there, real freedom, right!

For those of you that read the comments and those that are taking care of anybody with this damn disease you understand what Deb is talking about.
Our lives take on a new direction.
Not only are those with the disease withdrawn but so are the family members and the caregivers.
We are withdrawn from society because we can't get them to go out or hold a conversation anymore.
So yes we sit and watch tv shows and do things that we do not really want to do because it is what they want to do and it is hard.
Try to keep doing normal things for you.
If only it is to get out to the grocery store, or have lunch with a friend.
We have lost our best freinds.
And we will lose them again.
Conversations are hard because they either do not want to talk or they can't get the right words out.
We play charades alot.
Joe will want to say something and usually starts ok but he ends up pointing or grimacing and I can usually figure out what it is he wants.
As with everything else it too will go down the drain.
Joe started this to let everybody that wanted to, realize what was happening inside a victims head, understand what they were going through.
I am glad that he has helped.

This is my forum to tell you how I feel and for you to talk back to me.
It has always been my goal to make this not just about me, but about those that travel my journey before and after me.
For you that care for us to tell how you feel.
For those who contribute to leave posts on their take and views.
I personally feel that my time to the line is close and I am having difficulty battling that.While I fight it, I know inside and have accepted the fact the fight is lost, but I am an honory bastard and just have to fight for the sake of it, win or loose does not matter, I just will not give this disease the satisfaction it wants.
It is going to have to stomp on me and its shoes are getting heavier.
Sometimes my posts are less than kind, but this is not a kind disease and I am trying to make people think about us in this world as real people not someone in a looking glass.
This is my only forum to do that in.
I feel caged and somewhat worthless at this point and that feeling will probbably woresen as time goes on.
Well so much for now.
God Bless & Keep You & This Country of Ours!

My shrink has sent me back to my pshycologist, for help especially since his dad died from AD and he was the first to garee with me on what was taking place in my so called mind.
We have been meeting for a couple of weeks again.
Known each other close to 6 years.
As we sat and looked at each other, he asked why I was back and I told him.
We talked to kind of catch up to current things.
He asked me, "When I look to the future, what do I see?"
My reply after starring for a few moments maybe longer was, "Darkness".
I told him for me I see no future, for when you slice it all up and smooth it all out there is nothing there for me.
Just to keep loosing what abilities I have left and then crossing over the line.
What is on the other side of the line, I told him I do not know for I have no idea who or what I will be, except that it will not be me.
Maybe I will be lucky and pass on before that time comes.
See I look at us in this world of Dementia, as throw aways, really, how many families are able to withstand the constant care they need to give us as we move forward with this disease.
It definitely has got tear at them to a point of not being able to handle things.
Then they have there families and their lives and all that stuff.
So put Mom or Dad or Gramps or Grams in home that can clean them up and do the things they cannot handle.
Throw aways that is what we are.
Never mind the years that we put into raising them and helping and nuturing and getting their asses out of trouble, that does not matter that was our job not theirs.
Will I get shit for this post, YES, do I care NO, because the truth is what it is.
I am becoming more distant to family and friends.
My "friends" no longer email me except for those stupid forwards, some are funny.
I am not part of their world and I guess they do not know how to talk to me anymore.
Even those that I know that have a parent with AD and work for Alz.
Org.
Bitter I guess, you see I now see my world closing in and not as broad as it once was.
I have my moments, but more and more they are lessening, shopping is nearly unbearable for me now.
I fear leaving home because I might get lost even though I have to be taken everywhere.
Take care and be good to yourselves.
God Bless & Keep You & This Country of Ours!

Today I am not clear ast to what i want to say.
It is becoming difficult for me to keeep my thoughts in order, as if they ever were.
I am becoming more distant from my family, I feel very trapped by everything.
We went to the Birch Aquarium, I think it is called, in San Diego on Friday, it was fun, but to tell the truth I was not really part of being there, although the lady at the sharks was interesting, but you know my wife, she would not let me bring her home.
I am having more diffficulties with talking to, seems to come out sideways, good thing those around me have a clue to what I am saying, because I don't.
I have been watching and noticing all the things now that they say will slow down your getting AD and all the things that cause it.
It just leads me to believe even more so that these people are morons and have no idea what they are doing.
In most cases giving people false hope and bullshit answers.
Kind of sounds like are President and Congress.
What the hell most of them went to the same schools anyhow.
Well I am rambling, getting good at this.
Also have changed the site again and probably will still more, gives me something to do and screw up at the same time.
Well bye for now.

  Hello, I  hope you all had a great holiday weekend!
I wanted to get in touch to let you  know about an Alzheimer's Disease research study and invite you to share this  with Living With Alzheimer's blog readers.
Have you or a loved one ever experienced what it  is like to be unable to recall things which were once so simple to remember?
If  so, you may know how devastating the effects of Alzheimer's disease (AD) can be.
An estimated 5.3 million people in the United States  have Alzheimer's, and every 70 seconds another person develops this disease!
I  am contacting you today on behalf of the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study  (ADCS)  to raise awareness about AD and to encourage otherwise healthy  adults with early complaints of memory problems to participate in the  Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative Grand Opportunity (ADNI GO).
ADNI GO  will build on the unprecedented momentum and success of the Alzheimer's Disease  Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), a landmark study to find more sensitive and  accurate methods to detect AD at earlier stages and track its progress through  biomarkers.
By being able to recognize  changes in the brain, scientists hope to treat memory loss and other symptoms of  AD before they appear, but the only way to recognize what these changes are and  learn more about who is at risk is through the participation of volunteers.
"We  cannot end this terrible disease unless we know more about it," says Dr. Paul  Aisen, M.D., director of the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study (ADCS).
"That  is where the amazing volunteers, their friends and their families can make the  difference in our success."  Dr. Maya Angelou - the eminent  poet, author, educator, historian and professor at Wake Forest University - is working with researchers  to ask you and your loved ones to be part of the ADNI GO study that may help  bring us one step closer to finding a cure.
Click here  to hear from Dr. Maya Angelou.
If you, a friend, or a family  member is experiencing early signs of memory loss, you may be eligible to  participate in this groundbreaking ADNI GO study.
Please visit http://adcs.org/Studies/ImagineADNI.aspx  or call the Alzheimer's Disease Education and Referral Center at 1-800-438-4380 for more  information on study sites in your area.
I invite you to share this information  with your blog readers to help shed light on this devastating disease, and  encourage participation in ADNI GO.
Thank you for your time and  please feel free to get in touch with any questions.

I have been doing this blog for a number of years now.
Trying to tel you what it is like on this sid of the fence.
I am begining to wonder if what I am saying is getting old and has no meaning.
See I belong to a group study and we have a saying, "EXPECTATIONS ARE PREMEDITATED RESENTMENTS"!
I feel those resentments because I seem to get far less comments or emails.
That is my proble because I am expecting something in return for my posts, really I am not entitled to any replies.
This is my story with the disease and only my point of vew, such as it maybe.
I met with my shrink today and we kind of got into it and I told him you do not know what is in this world in which I live now, you are on the other side, you are one of them.
I know that my progresion has been seemingly slow and I have been well contained for lack of another word.
But that is only because of the brain power that I possed when this all started, I could control a lot of what was happending and hide it, I am no longer able to do that, it (AD & FTD) are doing their jobs very well now and the fox can no longer out run or manuver them.
Thank goodness my friends and family are around to guide me or I would be totally lost.
I do not even want to leave my house anylonger or really take part in life, I am retreating into myself where I feel safe.
Whether this is part of the proscess or not I do not know, all I know is that it is happening.
Take care of yourselves.
God Bless & Keep You & This Country of Ours!

Joe posted a few weeks ago about the fact that we have had some difficulity.
He has had some issues and yes I was hurt by them.
But in all fairness I guess I am to blame too.
As you know he can still find his way around the computer and sometimes it gets him and others into trouble.
So as a caregiver and as a spouse I am going to say that we need to ask questions when our other half is doing something that we are not sure of.
We need to check the bank statements and credit card statements just to make sure there are no charges there that we do not know about.
$10 here and there really add up.
Also just like we do with our children we need to know who they are talking to.
Whether on the phone or on the computer.
So I am sure that we will have a few more arguments about how we nag and are trying to control things but, if we don't damage can be done that can not be forgiven or forgotten.
Fortunately we are working on our end.
So do not be surprised when he writes that I am being a nag and not liking me or others very much.
We do it out of love.Pay Attention to what is going on around the person you care for.Lynn

<doc date=Tuesday, May 25, 2010>
As I walk on this journey of mine, although not alone, it does not seem that way anymore.
The wife and I have tried to have discussion about what is going on with me, but that veil of secrecy that has always been around me seem to be even thicker now.
It is becoming more difficult for me to express what is happening and what is inside, because frankly I am not sure what the hell is taking place.
I get more lost in my own head then I do elsewhere.
Out and about with people is close to being a no no.
Lynn has asked me several times what would make me happy.
Each time she has asked I come up with only one answer and that is to die or cross over the line.
I no longer like this on the edge shit, it is to confusing, frustrating and just gets in the way of everything.
I spend to much time crying inside and I have come to dislike me a great deal.
But there really is nothing I can do about that, the disease is doing its job and the meds, even increasing them is not helping.
Knew this time would come, just did not want to be here for it.
But since I am not the ruler of the universe, be thankful, it is not in my time but his (I wish he would hurry).

Yes if you are a rabbit.
See all other tests are done on lab mice, so if they do not have it you cannot, because according to all the people with Paper Hanging Degrees (PHDs), mice and us are very much alike.
I have often wondered why I had four feet, a long tail and grey fur, how stupid of me.
OK this is a serious question.
I cannot speak for anyone but myself.
For quite awhile the answer was NO.
It did not work and my brain did not stay with it and still does not.
I am allergic to the pills, I am not having rods stuck in my pride and joy, nor having a pump put in it or on it.
But guess what there are shots.
They use, let me get this right, vascular dilators, and have nothing to do with your sex drive or lack of it.
This is man side only, sorry ladies.
You administer the shot in the right or left side of uncle willie only.
Not on the top, bottom, tip, or like stupid here in a vein they burst and hurt.
But when done with accurate precision there is no pain, you may sweat a lot the first couple of times, but really no pain.
The bugger can remain erect for sometime, so dosage has to be adjusted.
One lasted almost 10 hours, wife was worried I was not, gosh it was nice to see my old friend again.
Ice packs finally killed it.
Notice using spell check, want to get this one right.
So YES there is SEX after Dementia.
If you want to take the steps and can remember why you have these needles and stuff in the refrigerator to begin with.
Thank god my wife remembers, because I am truly getting more messed up upstairs than you know, it is taking it's toll on me, conversations suck, I loose time, I cannot get out what I want to say without my tongue getting in the way, wife has learned dementiaese, new form of speaking.
Well that is all for now, more the next time whenever that is.
God Bless & Keep You & This Country of Ours!

So I am late getting to this, what the hell my fingers needed to be dusted off.
What follows are a couple of emails that I want to post, one with full permission, the other not so identity will be with held from that one.
My name is Jordyn and I am twenty years old studying occupational therapy.
My professor had us watch the HBO Living with Alzheimer's documentary for my class, functioning of the older adult.
I just wanted to let you know that I really respect you for opening up your life to the world and writing so freely in your blogs.
How great is it that people of all ages follow your blog!
People from 15 years old to 100 years old are reading your story and I think that is truly amazing.
Hearing you say that your life didn't matter in the great scheme of things broke my heart...I just wanted to let you know that your life does mean something and I hope to follow your blogs from now into the future.
It's a wonderful thing you're doing.
Have a great day!
Sincerely, JordynHi Joe, I am so excited that you e-mailed me back!
I would be honored if you posted my comment.
I actually just found out today that I was accepted into my Occupational Therapy program at Western Michigan University and I plan to work with older adults in my future career.
I hope you are your family are doing well.
I will keep you in my prayers.
Thank you so much for e-mailing me back.
Sincerely, Jordyn BellHey Joe!
I saw you on the Swedish Channel 2 today!
I heard you talking about your illness and I feel for you thou I am only 18 years old.
I hope that you can have a wonderful life and be happy all your waken time with your loved ones.
God knows you deserve it!
Greetings from Sweden!Dear Joe I continue to be thankful for your help in understanding what my dad went through as we lost him to AD.
Although he no longer knows me when he sees me, he often talks about his daughter and has wonderful memories of our time together.
Although I miss my dad terribly it is some comfort that I was able to give him memories of being loved and appreciated.
I pray those memories of time with your wife and family will remain.
And that you will continue to find days when you are with us all.
Take careThese are emails from younger people, those that are coming up the line to care for those that will follow me and are caring.
This is what keeps me posting knowing that just maybe, just maybe, we are reaching people and someday maybe just by complete accident one of these and the others in Brazil, Sweden, Chile, Argentina, Australia and other places that have writen by accident just may find out why this disease is.
I am not talking a cure or a medicine that MAY SLOW things down, but what really causes this.
Then and only then will the real breakthroughs come and not before.
I applaud you young folks, just for your interest not to mention the course you are setting for yourselves.
I WELCOME YOU TO MY WORLD.God Bless & Keep You and This Country of Ours!joePS.
To my friend Dr. Joe, I am a dumb SOB, ask those who really know me, God Bless and Keep You my Friend.

The las few days have beeen really rotten.
I have been confused, frustrated and a pure asshole.
I have hurt my wife, not physically.
But through being just a complete moron and ass and I cannot explain why.
I need ot openly appologize to her, just doing it directly has not been enough for me, I have to share it with another human being and my God for me to be free from it.
I am afraid this is a sign of things to come, havig real problems with conversations, remembering things, I just zone out and get really confused over stuff.
It is no wonder what I did really got to Lynn, she has so much to put up with me now, not to mention the prior 30+ years.
I feel myself slipping more each day, so far I can for the most part notice it, but there are days I have no idea what is what.
So I leave you for now, tomorrow if wonder lust here remembers I have some emails to post, that give hope to My World that there will be otherss to watch over us as we wear the current ones out.
God Bless & Keep You & This Country of Ours!!!!

Last night I found myself in very difficult and not likeable sitution.
It was a rough day for me as it was.
We sat down for dinner and I put my food on my plate and completely froze.
I had no idea what I was doing or what to do, my wife tired to help put I just told her leave me, she put my fork in my hand and it just fel from it, I was in a state of, in betweenness, between here and there.
I finally started eating but with my fingers and slowly got back to where I should be.
I am about 4 or so years into this and it is taking hold now as it seems to do about this time.
Now I am a beginning to become really concerned and not so humorous, but life will go on and so will I. I guess that line of no return is getting closer and sneakier about things.
Well that is it for now from: us here in Oceanside, CA.

Those of u that follow me know I love jokes about my condition, most are so true and funny.
The one tha follows as many I got from a good friend who brightens my day often.
Some may get offended but to damn bad, sit and think in through it is funny, our gov.
would make this suggestion.
The phone rings and the lady of the house answers, "Hello."
''Mrs.
Sanders, please"..
''Speaking."
''Mrs.
Sanders, this is Doctor Jones at Saint AgnesLaboratory.
When your husband's doctor sent his biopsy to the lab last week, a biopsy from another Mr. Sanders arrived as well."
"We are now uncertain which one belongs to your husband..
Frankly, either way the results are not too good."
''What do you mean?"
Mrs. Sanders asks nervously.
"Well, one of the specimens tested positive for Alzheimer's and the other one tested positive for HIV.
We can't tell which is which."
''That's dreadful!
Can you do the test again?"
questioned Mrs. Sanders.
"Normally we can, but Medicare will only pay for these expensive tests one time."
''Well,  what am I supposed to do now?''
The folks at Medicare recommend that you drop your husband off somewhere in the middle of town.
If he finds his way home, don't sleep with him."
see I would get lost.

Just in case you wer not aware it is May.
I know the calendar and my computer tell me so and they would not lie to me.
Well maybe they would cannot trust them buggers.
At least my brain doesn't, it really does not anylonger link days weeks or months together, let alone years.
According to the wife I have developed my own language, not heard on this Earth is billions of years.
It seems that when I cannot get out what I want to say, let alone remembber what it is, I express myself in sort of a babble type lanugaggge.
She seems to understand me, I sure the hell don't, I wonder who has the problem.
Her or me?
Since she can remember days, what to do and what she is talking about, she has the problem, those type of people do not live in my World.
What the title has to do with this is beyond my mind.
Sounded good.
Well we got some new young koi, will see how they do.
I have to do water changes on the ponds, and I do not want to, it is such a pain in the ass.
I guess the fishes like it, but not one has given me a fin to shake and say thank you.
They remind me of gov.
officials take it, shove it up my butt and not even a kiss.
Yes I am in a mood today, have been for awhile, never kno when they will come or go, seem to stay alot longer these days.
Take care, who knows i MAY see you soon.
There that is why the title.
If you believe that your brain is as blue as mine is.

I have been making some changes, and probably should have had someone else make them.
A few things have disappeared and others moved to second page with everything else.
Eventuallly I hope this will all get fixed right.
The skype call button now works after months of well disconnect.
See they require you put in your correct user name, can you believe that.
So finally I RTFM'd (back in my computer days that meant Read The Fucking Manual), and found I forgot a (.)
period in my user name.
So if you have tryed without success, it seems to be working now.
Hope to have thr rest of the mes cleaned up soon.
Brain cell is getting overloaded.

Really now, such a gentle wonderfull and forgiving person as I, a Tyrant.
The truth be known I can be a little, just a little over zelous at times.
Ok maybe tyranical to some degree.
Lynn is mostly correct in what she has written although I am not sure if I even am with them as much as they may believe.
I feel things slipping more and more away from me.
Going out has almost become a big no no with me.
I do not want to leave my security.
On the other hand I no longer want to be in this house.
I feel like I have done here what I was suppose to and I am now to move on.
It is a feeling I cannot explain, it is like a driving force that pushes me to do whatever it is that I am to do.
Writting and talking about it does not change it, it is there and it is real.
Before in life I did not hesitate to follow it.
Now I am confused and frustrated over the feeling and lately very unhappy over things.
I guess this is part of this world I live in now, no longer sure of feelings, thoughts, direction or security of where I am.
All I know is that I am here stuck and not knowing when to get off the bus at the correct stop.
I wonder or should I say wander within my own mind what is taking place, why, where and how do I get around this bastard that is following me and sucking my thoughts away.
Who am I today, not who I was 10 years ago I think and not even sure of yesterday.
Yesterday is a strange word to me, since everything happend yesterday, not last week, years ago, but just yesterday.
Family and friends around to help, yes I am lucky that way I guess, but they fuckin piss me off, I feel that they hover, whether they do or not is not the point it is how I feel and it makes me feel trapped.
Now if they didn's I probably would get angry that no one gave a dam.
No fun in this brain these days.

Well now that I have been on the guilt trip for not blogging on his site I will explain why.
Even tho I am a Leo I don't do a lot of roaring.
Only when it counts like protecting my family or friends.
For the most part I am a real pussycat.
So you wonder how in the world I managed to survive 30 years with this man.
So am I.
He is a tyrant when it comes to having things his way.
Always has been and probably will be till the end.
But he is also a very loyal and loving friend.
He is my best friend.
He would fight for me.
Since we have started this trip with his medical problems it has not been easy.
Lately he is stubborn, mean, forgetful and just not with the rest of us.
I have asked him questions and then he walks away without answering them.
Or he will say something about me nagging him and getting rid of wives that nag him.
Nagging consists of asking him what he wants to do on any given day.
So those of you out there taking care of a spouse or loved one just remember that we do it for love because who else is going to do it.
Me, I tell him I am in it for the money now.
So he should probably go back to work and earn some.
It is not easy and it will only get harder.
But we are in it for the long haul.
For those who can't stand up to the pressure do not feel bad.
This world is not for everybody and the quality of care is more important than who gives it.Take careLynnI

I spent sometine today reading some friends blogs and leaving my ever uplifting comments.
But you folks that change your links, dam tell me so I can keep my list correct.
I list you so others can read as well.
Hopefully the remaining 6 people I have invited will have the balls to post and the others will continue.
I would post daily if I could remember, but I start processing an entry and it starts one way, goes another, then turns left and winds up in the back forty, lost and me with it.
Hope the changes are to you liking if not to bad, deal with it.
Like a legal pleading now.
Find days are slipping by quicker.
The brain is getting bluer.
Always wanted to be a blue blood, but I have obtained higher standards I am a blue brain, Ok a dumbshit.
I was at my mens support group the other night, one of the guys there mothers has AD and wwe talk about it and he told me once that you could hardly tell, but his family insisted.
He sees her every couple of months or so.
Just got back and said he spent 4 hours with her and he was her brother and did not know what town they were in.
He was a bit taken back.
I asked is she about 4 years or so out from being labeled, he said yes and that she was on Aricipet (wonder drug, not).
He asked me why and I told him the truth, she is on schedule.
Also the A drug was for well toilet bowl cleaning in my opinion and many others.
We hugged I cried for him and prayed for her to be set free soon.
These are the real stories of AD not the commercials on TV or the movies, this is what it really does to us.
Like a thief in the nite it suddenly takes what it wants when it wants.
God Bless & Keep You & This Country of Ours!

Yes I know what gift?
You need to have the disease to understand.
See because of this blasted thing, I learned something today that I did not know, even with it starring me right in the kisser.
I was reading over some emails I got because of the HBO Documenttary.
It brought people I knew from over 50 years ago back into my life.
Of course they had to tell me how, when, why, etc., before the old noodle could grasp it.
This may get long and run in circles, but what the hell, if I can run in them so can you.
You see I wanted most of all to be a good husband, lover, friend, father and someone the Lord would be proud to call his child.
Well I feld very badly in my own mind and soul.
So as I re read an email from my first girlfriend, the only one nuts enough to date me, Cheryl, I really realized how fortunate I am to have AD.
You see, I have invited her to guest blog, but no response, what an asset to this site she would be.
Now remember she dated me (poor lady), her mom has AD and Cheryl works for The Alz.
Org.
in Colorado what a wealth of help.
But more than that, after we broke ups I had 16 years of a real messed up life.
So you understand and I am not sure I do, she was about 5'6"  115#, brown hair, brown eyes and nicely, well very pleasant to look at, not what a memory, she sent me a picture from that time, and a Leo.
I always felt comfortable with her, but life goes on and people (me) screw up alot.
What does that matter to you or me, well I just described my wife of over 30 years.
Now she is stuck with an AD patient and she is a Leo to, and I have asked her to post, but you know these lions the roar, but are really just pussy cats.
Because of this and the special I have found that my family was my career and Mr. How Smart Am I, was not even aware of it.
Cheryl and the rest of you have shown me that and I am well pleased inside.
Still confused and not sure what I will do from moment to moment but I am having quiet an adventure, and sometimes it is pretty rotten.
Just spent a week isolated to my self and not really talking to anyone, without being short and less than Kind.
I find that, at least i do, just wip back without concern of what I am saying.
From those I tak with that have this disease seem to do that alot to.
Well enough of me for now.
Be good and take care of yourselves.
God Bless You & Keep You & This Country of Ours!

First let me say that if you have not tried Google Chrome, you might want to, much faster.
I have added a link to the Beijing Tiantun Puhua Hospital today.
This may seem strange to you, but I figure if they can use this blog as a source for them in China, least I could do was add them to my links.
They contacted me, let me say that kind of took my socks off.
I needed their contact, the last couple of days have been very uncomfortable and less then memorable and they made my day.
It has been difficult to know where I have been, but I know I have not been with my family or my own brain, but that is life with AD and any dementia.

This week has been a difficult week for me.
Just toooooo much family and kids.
Good thing I have additional meds to take or I woud not have kept things to gether.
I love my family, but I am becoming less tolerant, more mouthy, angry and pissed mor easily.
I have a grate deal of trouble controlling my mouth and emotions lately.
I want to thank the two who have taken the opportunity to guest blog here.
I have invited several that I thought could add to the thought processes found here on both sides of the fence as it awere.
But it seems that some old "friends" choose not to.
Everyone has something to offer.
Even if it does not agree with what is felt here.
That is what this blog is about.
Expressing feelings about having dementia and those careing for us.
Neither side is neat and tydie, they both suck.
I miss the days when I could think more clearly and express myself and do it (ego here) with little room for argument.
Now I am lucky to blog at all.
But no this you are all welcome even those who feel I am just an angry old fart, angry yess, old yess and I guess a fart as well.
I try to not talk about everyday things, but how this disease affects me overall.
Yess some days I am on top of it others I cann't even find the stairs.
I do find the walls I walk into them and excuse myself.
Yes I have taken additional meds today, and am still shaking inside and my temper is border line, but the impression of my teeth in my tongue helps me keep quiet.
I will be posting some emails that I have been give permis to, I ask because not everyone leaves comments.
Dr. Joe I guess the 10.00 bucks I paid you for your post paid off.
Doc I really cannot walk on water, trust me, I can barely walk on the ground without it moving.
But I thank you, my friend.
Well you all take care and be good to each other.

Joe has invited me to be a guest poster on his great blog.
I would like to say first I am HONORED.
As someone who has come  into this disease differently then most most you who read here.
I am a caregiver in Memory Care at a community/facility.
I had never been personally acquainted with anyone who was diagnosed with A/D.
2 years ago I got a job in the field, I was scared to death not knowing what to expect and  quickly fell in love.
I have been surrounded with many different stages of this horrible disease and have also learned to hate it.
I am amazed with the human mind and just how much to does, and in this case does NOT do.
I would like to say that those of you who keep your loved ones at home, YOU have a harder job then I do.
I hope you have a large support group, it can get tough.
I get to do my 8 hours and leave to go home and get on with my life, you do not.
I, from the outside have watched people who I have become very close to loose to this thing.
The people in charge try to tell us to not get attached, HOW can we NOT?
They become my family, they depend on me to make sure they are safe,clean,secure,exercised both mentally and physically.
I sometimes feel I am the only one who will sit and reassure a resident life is ok.
It is heart breaking to watch my residents go from being a functioning person in their world to not being able to even eat or drink on their own.
I am in no place to know about the medical terms I only know the results of them.
In the last 2 years of my working with residents with A/D I have seen many different ages,genders,nationalities.
This disease does not choose a certain kind.
I learn what they once WERE and I am at times knocked on my butt with sadness at how not WHO they have become because of this.
I see that they are still the same person on the inside almost trapped in a body that will not allow them to continue with their lives.
I know it is at times very humiliating to them that I have to clean them, feed them, help them dress and even a little task of dressing is hard for them.
The stages I see are the beginning  confusion,anger,fear.
This is where to the outsider, these people get MEAN.
All they need is a little time,, slow down that is my big advice.
These people have done for themselves for many years.
toileted,showered,dressed,brushed their teeth everything.
Who are we the outsider telling them when,how they need to be doing these things.
SLOW DOWN, DONT' RUSH THEM,be careful with your words.
Don't say, YOU NEED TO DO,,,,,,,,,,,  I have found the gentle,LET'S DO THIS OR CAN WE DO THAT.
works so much better.
Tone and Volume play a big roll here too.
I truly believe this stage is the hardest to deal with.
They can be sweet as pie and in a heart beat ready to KILL you.
Trick here as I see it is keep your eyes open learn the triggers or the facial expressions and KNOW when it will happen as best as you can and head it off before it gets there.
Turning them around after they have gone fully into a rage is very hard to do.
I do NOT like medicating them as many seem to do.
Take in every smooth time you can, THIS TOO SHALL PASS.
It then seems to slips into those who float through their day.
We have what we call wanders/walkers who will NOT stop for the life of themselves.
The seem to not be able to sit still EVER, not even to eat.
I find finger foods work well at this point.
So what if they drop crumbs on the floor, they are at least eating something.
There are those who seem to be going on with daily lives inside.
They will go from room to room and pick up things that are not theirs and carry it to another room,setting it where they think it should belong.
We find so many odd things where they should not be.
Best thing to do it just smile, Does it really matter where it ended up?
Frustrating but IF ya leave it long enough it just MIGHT end up back where it came from in the first place.The end of life is the most heart wrenching of all,, I choose not to even go there with this .I will only say that for me I become attached to these people and my heart breaks almost as much as their families.So for me the caregiver who get to bow out for a time I give ALL you who keep your loved ones  at home with you and care fore them 24/7.
YOU are the ones with the hard job, your hard work and love is what counts most.
Thank you again Joe for asking me to post on your amazing blog.
Keep up your writing for as long as you can.
I will keep coming back and read.
You have given me yet ANOTHER view from the inside.

From my family to yours a very Blessed and Happy Easter.
To those of you who have entered this World of mine and do not celebrate the day, celebrate it with us for you are welcomed here.
To all I extend to you my hand so that YOU KNOW, THAT YOU, NEVER HAVE TO DO THIS THING CALLED LIFE ALONE EVER AGAIN.
Well I have started inviting some folks to be guest bloggers and we will see how this works.
I have tried with a 24 hour chatroom for you, that was not used, different ways of talking not taken advantage of.
See This is My Blog, but You are a part of it and I would like you to share in it.
Only requirement is that you deal with dementia, as a caregiver, reasearcher or one on this road of unknown journey.
Thanks Dr. Joe for being first to join in.
If you wish to join me and others here, just fill out the email form at the bottom of the right hand side and send me your email address and I will send you the info.
Actually Blogger will send it for me.
Well the family has descended and I have found it necessary to retreat.
I can only be a jungle jim for so long and I hurt.
Body is definitely not what it once was, not that it was ever much to start with.
My temper is much shorter and I have a hard time controlling me, so retreating works.
I feel lost today and not quite sure what the old brain wants besides to escape and be alone somewhere.
We may He Bless You All This Day and Forever.]

I would like to thank my friend Joe for the privilege of being asked to be a guest writer on his blog.
In the big scheme of things I have known Joe for only a short time through the wonderful technology of the Internet.
I started blogging about eight months ago and soon found Joe's blog.
I immediately resonated with so much of the feeling and emotion and spirit with which Joe writes.
I felt sort of a strange kind of kindred spirit.
It is sort of that weird feeling, where you never met someone but when you connect with them, you feel that connection was always there and it is sort of timeless.
You see Alzheimer's was the thing that connected us.
Joe has the disease, my mother was diagnosed with the disease in 1979, when most people had not heard of it.
I started a book about my journey many years ago and finally finished it this year.
It is titled When Can I Go Home?
I asked Joe to read the book and tell me what he thought.
I knew it would be hard, and I debated a long time.
I didn't want to make Joe feel sad or mad, but his review in a way was the most important one I wanted.
It was more important than if I could get Publisher's Weekly or New York Times or any high profile review.
Why was that?I wanted to show that people with AD are people who count, with thoughts feelings, and a spirit.
No matter how far the disease gets, there is a person.
The point of Joe's blog and the point of my book is that we should never, ever cast aside any human being just because they have AD.
The truth of that matter is: is that now matter how far we think we have come as a progressive, altruistic, advanced and humane society, we have a very long way to go when it comes to people living with Alzheimer's.
Alzheimer's initially brought us together, but immediately after that the connection was fundamentally not about the disease, but just about two guys, Joe and me who actually share a lot of the same fundamental views and insights.
And Yes, Joe has tremendous insights that we can all learn a lot from.
I am a psychiatrist, but Joe didn't not hold that against me.
Neither of us particularly like psychiatrists.
Joe instinctively knew and knows that is just what I do professionally, sometimes in that realm I can help people and sometimes I can't, sometimes all I can do is be there as a human being yet in that pretense of a professional realm.Joe said he only read a couple books in his life, mine and Bill Cosby's Fatherhood.
So I was indeed in good company!
Joe knew and talked about the disease, he knows first hand better than anyone, how Alzheimer's is two deaths.
The disease taking the person's mind and the physical death.
Joe and I know the disease tries to take the person's spirit.
some days it feels like it does, but it never really can or will.
You see Joe's spirit is there and always will be.
You see it in those faces in those pictures he posts, it is in those grand kids.
Those faces, those smiles, when you see it in his family and grandchildren you see Joe's spirit and his goodness, and the disease never ever can or will take that away.
That lives on forever, that spirit is eternal.
Take a look at his pictures, it is there.
You see Joe's essence.Joe asked for a picture of my mother.
He posted it on his blog.
Her name was Madeline.
She is physically gone from the earth, but Joe knows that we never forget, and her essence lives on through her kids and grand kids, and the disease does not get to take that.
People like Joe are a gift to the human race, he reminds us to never forget.In a way Joe knew the pain I still feel from my mother's disease, he sort of offered me a kind of spiritual absolution, a setting free if you will.
I never really considered or expected that, but Joe knew.
I hope in some way although I know it was hard fir him to get through, that in reading the book, somehow our connection set him free just a little.
He knows I will never cast him or anyone with the disease aside.
Joe is not an Alzheimer's victim, Joe is just a guy, a human being who happens to be living with the disease.
We can all learn a lot from his writing, it should be required reading in schools.
He is tough and smart, he is human.
We all have a little bit of Joe in us.
He will keep blogging and writing, it is not about the words it is about his essence and his spirit.
He will keep loving life and hating the disease, just like me.
He will love his family and his love will go on generation after generation.
Thank you Joe for this honor to post on your blog.
Your courage and dignity and humanness is there for everyone.

Sorry I forgot they have discovered a GENE in some families that makes them more prone to AD.
What a mystery, we knew it ran in some families, great rocket scientist work that there was a gene.
So I ask, what does that do for these folks?
Did you discover how the gene causes AD?
(Yes or probably NO) Just how will this help those to follow me and others?
I know I sound skeptic, but 100+ years and nothing.
Imagine HIV in 1980's, we are now working and testing a vaccine for it.
I am sorry for thoses who got the disease through no fault of there own, but sharing needles, unprotected sex, etc.
your choice.
I and those before me and with me have not had any choice in this.
I could take on cancers and heart disease, but I think most of you know how I feel and why.
#7 Reported Killer - AD.
No cure, No Survivors.
Only you can really help come out of the shadows and join others and beat down the doors of stigma, we are not lepoards which now can be stopped.

Normally I talk about how this affects me, today I like to beg the question, "Do You Really Know How This Disease Kills?"
I suggest to many of you your real and honest answer is not really.
They tell us (the know it alls), that we forget things slowly, forget to eat, bathe, etc.
and then linger and die.
Well I in my limited capacity suggest to you that they are chuck full of shit.
Joseph forgets none of these things, that which is Joseph.
What happens really is that my brain, that finally tuned sharp as a tact organ, does the fucking up.
You see when my stomache or body sends the enzymes and nerve messages to my glorious brain that I am hungry and need to eat, the damned thing no longer understands, it now speaks a second language.
My bladder and intestines scream, so it listens to my ears of course they have nothing to do with those lower class forlks and well you can guess the result.
As time goes on my brain no longer recognizes smells, so who needs to bathe?
Latter I die do to liver failure (the second death).
Why?
Well stupid upstairs answered the wrong phone call, not the one for instructions from the liver, but the bladder.
Or my heart stops, why, because Mr. genious was trying to tell me my toe hurt.
Get the picture.
I will physically die as others because my brain will no longer under stand it's own unique coding system to keep me functioning.
NOT ME, not my doing, the grey matter will be out to lunch.
As the old saying goes, THE LIGHTS ARE ON, BUT NOBODY IS HOME!
What brought this to my train of thought was The Forbidden Planet, where the robot is given a command and it's electrical signals (the brain) went into turmoil and with nothing to counter act the order it would just go kaput.
So goes our brain, kaput.
A bunch of ramdom requests made by our organs that just confuse the hell out of it, so they all shut down and so does it.
Process not compatible with life, THE END.
Simple stated yes, but it is that basic.
Now all the brilliant ones can tell me how wrong I am, with their fancy words that when boiled down to their basic elements will be just kaput.
You see I grow weary with all the BS of how much more we understand and all the strides made.
I say to you then "WHY ARE THEIR NO SURVIVORS?"
It is simple you do not have the answers and are not even close.
You study rats and mice, I am neither, you study dead brains (wow they can speak), mine is still alive, study mine and others like me, maybe then you may get some real answers.
I do not mean your normal 100 or 200 particpatnt studies, try one of 10,000 there are more than enough of us.
You all claim that about 5.5 million people (this country only) are affected by AD in this country, I submit you are wrong.
I have AD and I affect, my wife, mother-in-law, five children, physc, GP, physcologist, 7 grandchildren and about 5 friends.
That is a total of 22 people affected by me.
Lets say that 5.5 million onlyy affect a total of 7 each, that means that 38,500,000 people are affected.
Why are we still put on the back of the bus?
I wonder what the cost in $$$$$ is, billions yearly, maybe that will catch your dead ears.
Till later take care and be kind to yourselves.
My brain now hurts.
God Bless & Keep You & This Country of Ours!

Confusing title, well maybe.
See my wife told me the other day that one of the earliest problems I had after the diagnose was made, was keeping genders straight.
Apparrently then and now when I talk about her I am talking about him and so on.
Maybe this is why I never had much luck dating in my early years.
The last few days I have felt kind of lost in space and not sure of what I am exactly up to or doing.
But I have not met any green people lately.
Will be attempting on working on changing my blog, the look and such, hopefully I can test it somewhere to fix the mess ups.
Hope to make it so that those who read it can also blog on it.
Maybe open some discussions or give some of you a place to say what you need to.
Will see what happens.
Time to put my brain to rest again before it attacks me.
God Bless You & Keep You & This Country of Ours!
Joe P.S.
Do not feel like I do not appreciate your emails, I have been very bad lately at answering.
Starting not to even turn this beast on anymore.

I know that a number of people with AD and other forms of Dementia read my site as well as a number of care givers.
I had something happen to me yesterday that has me well shall we say concerned for what might lye ahead.
I need some advise if any of you have experienced this.
I got up, nothing special, but I went about the day doing what I had to without any type of mental or physical interruption.
My wife's computer has been giving her fits, so I spent 10.5 hours on completely rebuilding it and setting it back to where it should be will all files she lost.
This all took place without skipping a heart beat.
I felt completely in control and as if it were 7 or more years ago.
For me I felt normal, whatever that is or was.
What scares me is, what the hell does this mean and is it something that happens at times, because I wonder if a bigger slide is comming and this was a sort of last hurrah.
Any insight would be helpfull.
God Bless & Keep You & This Country of Ours!Joe

I do not know what this one will be titled, because I am not sure what is really inside of me today.I finished after quiet sometim a book called "When Can I Go Home".
I was asked for what reason I am not sure to review it.
The author can post my review if he wishes once I write it.I will tell you that I think, once and awhile, that most people will miss the real hidden story of the book.
Caregivers will find solice from it I am sure.
But what struck me is that we that live in this world of AD are still put aside as the wicked stepchild.
Not that, that was necessarily done here, but seems to me it was without knowing.See I feel that way because folks say no your ok, and I am not, I never know where or who I am going to be.
I started this blog in 2006 and I am not sure why anymore.
I like hearing from folks but I really wish those who read this that live in this World of ever growing darkness and confusion would write me.
Feeling alone in this journey is no fun and I know I am not alone but feel that way often.
It is difficut writing these things trying to keep them readable.It upsets me, again my problem, but people write you write back and never hear from them again.
I am sure that I have forgotten to answer many an email.
I can only same I am sorry, here to all that I have missed.I wonder if you know that AD is the #7 killer.
I think that if they put the real reason people die, like their liver stopped because their brain forgot to tell it to work and things like that happen frequently with this disease that it would very likely be #1.My brain is just bouncing around right now so until later, be good to yourselves.God Bless & Keep You & This Country of Ours!

Many of you probably find that an easy question.
Well around here it is asked who knows how many times each day.
Then I always ask are you sure.
Of course minutes later I ask all over again.
My wife smiles   so pleasantly and reminds me one mor time.
After awhile my daughter will just say Dad it doesn't matter.
I guess she is right.
See to me it is always someday but I am not sure which one.
If I rember I will ask from now on "Is Today, Today".
hopefully it will lessen some of the frustration.
But first I have to remember  , now that is another story.Oh well life goes on and I just keep doing whatever it is I do.
Thanks for listening, stay well and be good to yourselves.
God Bless & Keep You & This Country of Ours!

I stopped cooking the last time I tried to broil some chicken and set it a blaze.
It got done, but on the chrunchy side and a little charcoallly.First I read my friend Marys blog, she had a great picture of a head with lettered blocks int it and telling how she had to get heres back together.
I feel very slighted, she has more blocks in her head then I do, the wood peckers have gotten mine.
But the two I have left crash together quite nicely.I mad spaghetti tonignt.
Used a can of Hunts Traditional, to which I added galick powder, bazil, parsley, salt, peper and sugarr.
I saucted a full bulb of fresh garlic, halving each clove and added pistachio nuts to it with little salt, pepper, garlic powder and Olive Oil about 11/2 teaspoons.
Cooke the garlic and nuts until all the oil was absorbed, dumped it into the sauce, very unceremoniesously.
Browned and well drained som hamburger and blended it in and cooked about half hour.
Off course we cooked noodles to.
It actually turned out.
Not to bad of a day today.We do have some good days.
I want to let you know of what I feel is good, at least for me having this wonderful disease, it has given me a peace inside about dieing, which is what is happening.
I am no longer afraid of it, nor worry about it.
In fact I look at it as my next journey, after this crappy one is over.God Bless You All & This Country of Ours!joe

First thanks to all you who offered their prayers for my friends Mary & Jim.
I spoke to Mary via Skype today and so far so good.
Again Thank you!
A Drum roll if you please!!!!!!!!!
!The old pond area, waterfall removed and relandscaped, not by me others in the house.
Will be used for water plants and raising up our baby Koi that are due soon.
First I have to get a male to help the preganant one.I know you all have been waiting for the new area.
Well except for getting the lighting all correct and wiring finished here it is.
Thanks for waiting and asking for the pictures, my hide away is near complete.
In case you are wondering, which you have to be, where did the othjer water fall go.
Well it now graces the front of the house.
We also have an ornamental type pond out there.Thank you all for beign out there for me.
It is much appreciated.
Now the brain is fried for the day after trying to place these pictures where they did not want to go.
Thanks again!
God Bless You and This Country of Ours!

My friend Mary, who's site is listed in my linkes, is having some real troubles health wise.
Also her doctor is being a pain about meds for her hubby who has AD also.
Please say a prayer for the two of them so that they get the right help.
I would appreciate it.
I am starting to loose to many friends to this disease.They live in Canada and their whether is nowhere as nice as my haunts.If I remember I will post pictures of THE POND, yes it is 95% done, need to get an electrician to run the out door cables for me.
Me and electricity, not a good match, never was and even less so now.Until later:God Bless You & This Country of Ours!Joe

My ggrandson Lucas is now home from hospital and out of the NICU and mom is fine, so they do not have that stress anylonger.We built a cover over the pond and have started to plant the area, should be done soon, then will post pictures.
We have a new femaile Koi that is pregnant.
She is black with a white belly and white nose so we call her Orca.
Have to get a male for her, since I lost mine.I have been trying to read a book from a friend who has been published and it comes out in June, so I cannot tell you the name yet.
I am having problems with it, very slow reader I am.
But what I see in it that for you care givers it probably will be good.
I cannot relate to the person's feelings from this side of the fence, except to let them know that many of their feelings we have on this side.
Of course we don't have the family BS of what to do with us to tend with, we just keep going on and forgetting.
But I can see how it could get tacky, since we are still locked away and forgotten about.
Not alot has changed over the decades.I am starting to become disconnectd from life in general and my past and who I once was.
Things seem to be of little importance anymore.
Ask me this afternoon what I did this morning and I will have problems telling you and so goes the day and my life.
Trying to keep a sense of humor is becoming hard, I do not like this world of mine but I cannot change it, it is what it is, shit.Posting is getting harder.
The note on my computer to do so does not help much, I just start and forget and walk away.
telling of the misery of this does not even fill worhwihile anymore.
There is a lonelyness that is setting in a feeling of being apart from everything, and trying to hang on I feel like I am drowning in a vast void in my mind.So much babbling.God Bless You & This Country of Ours!joe

We are back from Petaluma.
Daughter and new grandson doing well.
She is home, Lucas still in hospital hopefully home this Saturday.We finally got a room on base in guest quarters.
Gramps here could not handle staying with the kids, even though we had our oun room.
I needed a hide out period.
Had to increase meds while there just to try and cope.
Am Losing control of my emotions and ability to keep calm and mouth shut.Came home sick again.
But we have figured out the problem, their is mold and mildew all over tha t base and I am highly alergic to mold.
So from now on will have to build up with antihistamines before we go.Now to start back on the pond.
God this disease just makes me not want to do things , forget  what the hell I am doing and really now mly emotions and starting to not care about others, they are starting not to exist for me.
I have a very hard time writing on this thing now.
Mind wanders toooo much.
But still can get out something.
Body is starting to rule itself and not tell me.
Eating I forget to eat or tha t I ate real pain.Until we meet again.God Bless You & This Country of Ours!joe

We are here in Petaluma.
That is between San Fran and Santa Rosa.
Wheather has been ok.Our Daughter Morgan is doing fine and grandson Lucas is progressing well.
He is breathing totally on his own and is now eating.
So tense times are lessening.
We will be here another week or so.
I really wish I was home, that is safe haven for me.
Plus I have some idea wherre I am there.Other three grandkids driving me a little batty, have hard time dealing with them and their energy, trying to keeep things straight is not easy, oh well.Will keep you updated as I reemember.God Bless You & This Country of Ours!joe

Yes at 10:26AM our 7th grandchild was born.
His name is Lucas, by emergency C section.
2 months early.
We are leaving for Petaluma, early tomorrow to help or do what it is grandparents do do.Fish pond disaster after our storms, but what the heck we are fixing, repairs now on hold.My brain hurts and is not handling this well.

Well I am back here at the monster again.I am still asking for those of you who would like their loved ones, friends, etc.
who have passed from AD to send me their picture, first name, birth year and year of being set free.
As you see so far only 3 people have felt that their loved one's should be honored, what about the rest of you?
Yes I can get snotty.The chatroom will disappear soon, I only paid for it for a year and I do not know if anyone has used it, so goes life.Also NOTICE if you have skype on your computer, headphones, microphone and speakers you can call me free just click on CALL ME button.
If i am on we will talk.Things in this world of mine are getting a bit out of touch with me.
I feel like I am beginning to seperate into two different folks, the one who knows (as if I ever did) what they are doing and one who hasn't a clue.We finally finished our second KOI pond, Sept to now, not bad.
Waiting for the season to warm up to bring in new fish, lost 1/2 of my others.
Home projects I still like but they are becoming very hazardous to me.
I built a square box around the pond for cemment so that the pavers vor the patio could be laid straight and shot my self in the finger with the nail gun.
Then while laying the bricks one by one and setting them I smashed the same finger with the mallet, of course I really warmed up for that brick setting.
Finally has feeling coming back in it.
Golden years, kiss my butt.Wife is now home with me for not sure how long, I guess until she cannot take me anymore or I send her back to work.
Wants to do toooooo many things.
What a pest, but I love her, so sorry guys I am keeping her, in it for the money now.I am still amazed at my friend Mary in Canada, how she posts almost daily, I just cannot get it together to do that.If you have a blog or website, that is not in my lisk of links and want it there email me jolynn1@cox.net  with the name and I will enter it.
I do follow alll the links I have, in the back part of blogger you can list those you want to follow and you get continual updates as people post, really neat.
I just need to comment more, get to involved then forget what I am doing and walk away in disgust, Well before I babble a brook you all have a great day.
I am going to hide from the rain.God Bless You & This Country of Ours!Joe

First to AJ if you read this you have my permission to use any part of my blog you wish, with the exception of the In Memory of Photos.
I do not have permission to allow that.
My stuff have at it pictures, posts, etc.I am starting to loose more and more days and time.
I am feeling a sense of loss in my life now more than I did when I started this journey.It confuses me, for a period I am normal and can do anything I know where I am and then someone comes along and turns the lights out.
I guess this is the way it goes and will continue until.
I hear from folks how well I am handling this, and how great the HBO special was, etc.
I am not that person anymore, he disappeared almost 2 years ago when the filming was done, at least I think it was that long ago.
It is more difficult to concetrate on writtting these posts now, probabbly why I am not doing so much anymore.Well the best5 to all of you.God Bless You & This Country of Ours!joe

I know I am a day late and a dollar short but; HAPPY NEW YEARS TO YOU ALL.
I want to thank all of you that have followed my blog, sent me coments, emails, good and thos not so.
Even the ones I had to have interpreted for me or replying with , WHAT?
See you need to keep it simple and clear for me, my one time brain cell hsa shrunk to about 1/4 of its size this past year.My family and I hope and wish all the best for you and yours in the coming New Year and years to come.For me 2006 was not as good as 2005, 2007 got a little worse, 2008 things got on the move, and last year 2009 this disease reallly started to make itself known.
So things being what they are I would imagine 2010 is going to be interesting as I trudge this happy road of Alhzeimer's and FTD.For now take care catch you on the other side.God Bless You & This Country of Ours!Joe

I hope you all had a great Christmas.
We spent the time at the US Coast Guard Training Center in Petaluma with my daughter, son-in-law and 3 grand children.
Now I am sick, kids were sick so gramps got it also now.
Today we will be having Christmas with the rest of the family and grandkids.I hope that next year is peaceful and blessed for you all.I see my friend Mary in Canada has been going to town with her new site which will be updated on my links today, I hope.
Need to remember to do it.We have been putting in our third pond, moved my koi to the bigger one and lost my big guy.
He was about 14 inches and around 3 pound, had him since little.
Hopefully we can save the others, moved them back to old pond and started treating them, will see.
So far we have lost about six.
I do not know if I am sad, mad, pissed or who cares.
This disease has really messed with my emotions and state of mind.
As you can tell I am ok at this moment.
Later who knows.
So before I babble on like a brook, you all have a great day.God Bless You & This Country of Ours!Joe

Yes those caregivers need a lot of love and tender care.
You all know what us with AD & FTD can be like to care for.
Talking to us or at least trying to can be very trying and nerve racking.
My ability to hold meanningful concersations is starting to waine quite a bit.
I get lost in them not to mention the poor person who talks to me.
What follows is a picture of my beloved wife and I holding such a conversation.
Do not lauugh to loud it is serious.God Bless You & This Country of Ours!Merry Christmas!!!!

<doc date=Monday, December 14, 2009>
Yes that is my take on this.
They do not have a clue to what they are doing.NEW STUDY: Gist of the study is that those who have 5 cups or more of coffee each day can slow the onset and progression of Alhzeimer's.
Now is what few cells I have left are working, I believe studies in not to distant past showed that this type of coffee consumption put you at a higher risk of Bladder Cancer.
Well I guess drink the coffee, get the cancer, stop drinking the coffee and forget the cancer.
Maybe I am wrong but seems to me, that spirits were part of this one.Next & I Love This One: proves a point made in one of my listing.Salk Institute scientists in La Jolla, CA:  major incredible fantanstic break through.
Of course we used GENETICALLY MODIFIED MICE:so normal humans won't work in this one.
The GM mice "not only lived longer, but the onset of mental decline was also delayed".
Reports Andrew Dillion of the university as reported in the North County Times by Bradley J. Fikes.
This gets more interesting, I love amoloyids, they do not know what they are to do.
According to Dillin (A Professor at Salk), their research shows that th plaques of these toxin protiens in those of us with AD and the like: ready for this: ARE NOT THE CAUSE OF THE DISEASE.
Guess allyou PHDs outhere need a brain transplant.
Instead and this is a quote from the article:  "Instead, the clumps of beta amyloid proteins are how cells stow away the toxic proteins where they can't do damage, Dillin said.
"Well now, rest of study is to be published in the 12/11 issue of Cell.
Have not gotten to it yet.I hate to rain on a parade but these folks are all over the place.
This is why I am so harsh on them.
They can not get their heads unstuck from their a****.
Cannot repair brain cells from what I know.
So I see no cure, and all meds may slow down the progression no solid proof they do in at least 85% of AD patients, that I have found, more like maybe 20% if at all.This is just interesting to me.
You may or may not know that many NFL players over time have donated their brains for study, after they are dead to see the affects of all the concusions and blows to the heads they take do.
In the group thus far checked of those in their 30,s to 50,s that have passed, it was noticed that, all though no signs at least know showed, but these guys had brains that looked like they had some form of Dementia for YEARS.
just something interesting.
So you folks know that I do try to keep up as much as possible on my disease and the tinker toy ways they are working on it.Blast me, but these folks still do not get it.God Bless You & This Country of Ours!Joe

Yes,it is Tis I. Camelot humor.
It seems to me that I just posted, by my wife reminneded me that it had been over a week.
Time is becoming of little meaning to me and I no longer seem to have a grasp on it.
Today is raining and windy, here in Sunny So.
CA, love the rain.
At one time it use to charge me up when it  would get stormy, now nothing.
I feel things moving faster now.
I sit here and have to close my eyes to concentrate on what I want to say, and damned if I can figure it out.Yes it is the Christmas  time again.
I hope you have a Jolly and Peaceful one.
Maybe this time you and I can find away to keep this feeling always not just now.This year let us not forget  for they give us the freedom to live free and enjoy our lives.
They sacrifice their lives for us and should be honored.I know I am not staying very well on ssubject, byt my thoughts are getting in a bind you could say.
I wish the old me was here, he could at least most of the time stay on topic.I doubt that by next year this time, I will be writing here.
Hopefully my wife will take over and let you know, where mindless has gone to.A VERY MERRY CHRISTMAS TO YOU ALL!!!!!!

where i get my titles is unknown to me.
But it seems that my dreams and my reality are starting to be one in the same.
I wake up hear voices, it is my dream entering my what ever you call it, I guess my here and now.
It takes awhile for things to clear up.
I am normally fine until this time of the day, after this 11:30 or so, the day just plain disappears on me.
I no longer can do math by hand and mind, need a calculaor, pisses me off to no end.
I had to leave twitter, sokule & facebook, could not keeep up with them.
Hells bells I have enough problems with this thing.
Had numerous on line business and affiliate accounts have closed them as well.
Although things were witen down and all in a book organized, I got to confused and angry and just could not handle things.
As of today the Joe that I once kew no longer exists.
I am becoming someone else and I am not happy over that.
Yesterday I turned 65 an age I never ever expected to reach or frankly wanted to, especially in my drunkin druggie days of my 20's.
In my 20's did not know what the hell I was doing, somethings never change back in the saddle, no drugs or alcohol, don't need it now, brain is fucked as it is.
Strange family was over last night but yet I was alone and am most of the time.
Feelings towards others seem to keeep getting farther and farther from me.
They are not leaving, I AM.
I do not hear words right anymore, no car, problems with the bills and the check book, my wife Lynn can go to give me a kiss an it will scare the crap out of me.
I forget who she is.
So much for my babeling soon it will be Turkey Day, yes I will over eat and be in gastric distress big time.
I even got some of the big words right this time, no red lines under them, look out.
Bye for now.God Bless You & This Country of Ours!Joe

userid = jpotocnyFirstLastName = Email = Message = why yu gotta be such a curmudgeon?
i got on ur sight  for some insight into the disease, my mom has it too.
but i dont want to listen to yur ranting and bitterness.. not that i blame yu but i wont be bak.
life is hard enuf for us without listening to someone elses negativity.
i thank god my mom aint bitter and angry like yu.
she so sad at times but othertimes she is happy too and like my own child.
sorry for yuThank you for using Bravenet Email Form Processing!
(YES I AM CHEATING AGAIN USING SPELL CHECKER ON MY PART even used grammar checker)As many of you know I invite all comments and emails.
I publish them as received.
So that you all know, I get many like the above.
Of course I hide their identity on emails, but did not have to with this one, them, him, her or it, did not have what it takes to give a first name.
This comes from the email block I have on the right side of the blog, so you can email instead of leaving a comment, if you do not want it published.But I have not edited it, spells like me, because I do not change comments and the like.
I have said in the past and still do, bring it on as you feel.I am sorry that your mom has joined this ever expanding World of Alzheimer's or Dementia.
It is not a fun way to live.
Try reading my blog from the beginning and then judge me.
You got insight, but could not hear it, your ears and eyes are closed.
You think with your heart, which is wonderful, but this disease gives a damn about your heart.
It wants and is taking your mom away, like it or not.
I am not bitter at the disease or people in general.
But I am offended, slighted and angry with those who claim to know how we feel and are making progress.
Progress in what?
Same info we have now existed over 100 years ago so where is the progress, I keep asking and hear nothing but silence.I do not enjoy this disease, it will KILL me period.
Not only physically, but it is the loss of me that is taking place that just rips at my very fiber.I say to you who will not return, yes you will, as you see what takes place with you mom.
Here you will hear and have heard the truth from one who suffers and is declining.
From others you can find the soft gentleness that you seem to want to hear, but not the harsh reality of it all.If you have the chance to see the HBO documentary ,The Alzheimer's Project, pay close attention to the time of diagnosis and the immanent decline of the people and how quickly it can come and see what is ahead.You see Josephine just pasted away a couple of weeks ago.
Of course Cousin Cliff passes in the documentary (for real).
I do not know about the rest how they are but sure would like to know.Well I have said what I needed to, I did walk away from the computer before doing this because I wanted to really strike out, but I still have some control over my emotions.
Not very often but, once in awhile I manage.
So before I go off in another direction Good Bye for today.God Bless You & This Country of Ours!Joe

Many of you may not know, because the media does not care this is NATIONAL ALZHEIMER'S AWARENESS MONTH.
Let your local papers know, let us see if they have the balls to say anything.Again I ask for pictures, birth year and year of passing of loved ones that died from this damnable disease.
Two of you have heard.
They need to be remembered for they are the faces of Alzheimer's.
(Yes I used spell checker, so I cheated)!If you like this blog I ask you to click on the Wellsphere voting Icon on the right and vote for it.
I know that many on Wellsphere do not necessarily like it, I am not a caregiver or dr.
I just suffer from the disease and try to tell how my life is deteriorating and getting worse as we move to my physical death.
Yes the 7th leading cause of death.
Probably if death certificates showed the real agent that caused death I am sure that it would be higher.
Most to feared diagnosis so it is said, is you have Cancer and You Have Alzheimer's.
Help me spread the word Please.Till next time thanks for your thoughts and help.God Bless You & This Country of Ours!Joe

The so caled pros that know everyghing, you know the PHDs, the ones with the Paper Hanging Degrees, they still know Jack Squat about this disease.
Ant those of you out there withit, that write your wonderful books and taught your abilities to do so, you sure are a big help.
Dr. Joe (not me) runs a blog that makes my fires burn, because he knows his mom died from it and still hears all the bs of 20 years ago today, with new hair brained ideas.
You want the answers here we are standing ready to show you the way, but you alas are to stupid to realize that just maybe we hold the key and the lock.Yes I am a tadd upset, because each day we help keep them boobs healthy and 15000 less a year die (which is good), more of us are let to go by the wayside.
You see my world is getting worse each day, the one in my head, the one outside of me has been really fucked for just over a year now and going to get worse.
Maybe it isn't so bad that I suffer from this Disease, soon I won't give a shit about any of you, because I will not know who the hell you are.
Well it is Turkey Month, this year I give it to the Medical Profession and The Do Nothing Politicians.
Uncooked, ungutted, feathers and all, you won't be able to tell the difference any how.To those I still love and care about.God Bless You & This Country of Ours.Joe

The great burden you shoulder with us on a daily basis, which can be unbearable at times, is lifted from you.
You once more are blessed to live your life.
Maybe caring for another, or just getting a very well deserved rest for your heart, soul, mind and body.From thos stil in my world and those that have been set free: THANK YOU11God Bless You & This Country of Ours!Joe

Thursday this disease took another from My World.
You know it takes owr minds, it takes our emotions, it takes our feelings, it takes our abilities, then it takes our last breathe.
But what it does not know iss that it returns it all to us and sets us FREE from its crips.
Yes from the grips we snatch Victory.
To you my friend Josephine, I can hear you sing your song of Freedom, see you running through the tall grasses under the blue skies.
I was blessed, I got to share the big screen with you, but for a moment.
Now I know you are free and it brings me hope.
Annie God Loves You and so do Lynn and I.God Bless & Keep You and This Country of Ours!

Last post has drawn some hard comments, which is great.
But the one I am going to post here comes from a friend whose mom is suffering a great deal from this disease.You know what enrages me?
The commercials for the drug that makes your eyelashes grow darker.
WTF?
There are people dying of AD and other hideous diseases, but we need a f'ing drug that makes eyelashes grow darker.
Again, WTF?2:21 PMMy point exactly.
I was informed that they found the protien believed to be the culprit.
AMALOIDs probably speeled wrong.
But guess what Dr. A. in 1906 or 1908 made that discovery, boy we are moving fast.
By the way this same protien can settle anywhere in the body, and that means any organ and cause failure.
It is produced by the body.
As I understand it, and we have to remember my brain here, they are formed by an auto imune sysdrome that attackes the white corpusles in the blood and breaks them down into these things and they do not know how to stop it exactly.
Got a lesson these on Discovery Health, where a lady was in almost complete kidney shut down from these  wonders and I forget what they did to help her, but they did say things could happen again as they did not know how to really stop it.
Let's grow those eyelashes, boobs and fix up our stomaches and loves handles guys and gals.The word AIDS was a stigma but it is ok now, not having it but talking about it.
But Alhziemer's get away you with the plaque.God Bless & Keep You and This Country of Ours!joe

Since HBO has ran and is running the documentery on AD, I have had a slew of emails from this country, Chilie, Brazil, Canada, Australia, Israel, just all over.
What has gotten to me is the YOUNG PEOPLE, who have suffered the loss or are suffering a parent and a grandparent and because of this special they want to do something to help.
Wow I say, and the adults in this country and around the World have sat on their asses all this time, yes even the tauted medical profession.
I hear we have come along way since 1906 or 1908 whenever AD was coined.
How far have we come is it in real knowledge, help, knowing the CAUSE, curing or is it just plain ass TIME?
I read the studies and that contradict each other, the so called quak cures and how to stop and cure it.
But yet I have not read on single word mentioning a persons name that has been cured.....Oh let us march for a cure, bull shit.
Let us first march to find the cause, no cause no cure, that is how it works.
Yes these folks will do good in raising funds and maybe some awareness to help in the research on the disease.
But since it does not affect your boobs, balls, prostate, colon or lungs, I guess it just does not warrant the NFL or other major playes to do anything.
You know I have seen the cancer marches, heart disease, etc.
and people where T-Shirts, "I AM A SURVIOR OF CANCER".
Watch the walks for AD and find me a picture of just one person that has a shirt that says, 'I AM A SURVIVOR OF ALHZIEMERS OR DEMENTIA"!
find it, it will not exist, we all die period.
I know Iwill get hate mail and the such, but bring it on, truth stands on my side.
Ask the literally 10's of millions around this World that have been affected by it having or knowing one.
I do not take the other killers, cancer, heart disease, diabetes, obesity, aids, etc.
lightly but boy are there a lot of people (baby boomers) in for the ride of their life, with no real help.Straight talk from one who suffers and is declining, I hope that I enrage you enough to do something and get rid of socialized medicine it is a failure and by God, do not just take your Drs.
word for what is wrong, make hin/her explain why and in detail.
It is your LIFE and your BODY that is at stake.God Bless You & Keep You & This Country of Ours!Joe

I will be posting another who has left this hell in which I live, that I call My World.
Friend Arlene has pasted.
I read it said of her that she lost the war but won the battle.
I greatly disagree, she lost the battle but WON THE WAR.
This disease takes our minds and bodies while it works, but you know the stupid bastard that it is, it winds up setting us FREE of its grip.
So I ask in the final analysis, Who Wins?I am sad that Arlenes' family has lost her vibrant character, but what joy they must also feel that she is now at peace and I believe with our Lord.
I am jealous, her hell is over, mine is still going on and getting worse.
Yes I can write, but I no longer can do the things I once did, my normal conversations leave some empty spaces.
As I have said I have no concept of time.
See I am writing now, I just got up and this is when I am at my best, few hours maybe less, well hello mindless.I will post Arlenes picture later after I finish transfering it to my computer and stumble through the process of the posting.Till Then.God Bless You & This Country of Ours!Joe

Yes it is your on the scene reporter coming to you from his favorite City.
I have not the faintist idea what is going to come of this post.
I had it thought out and as usual as I type it flutters away.My wife, Lynn the crazy one that married me, and I were talking one day, when who knows.
I told her that my feelings and emotions have real problems with themselves, half the time I do not even care or love my family, other times the opposite is just as strong.
I guess this wonderful companion of mine the big Dementia, is doing its job on me as it should be.
Time means nothing anymore, a good deal of the past is leaving along with the supposed friends.
But I think maybe it is reallly me that is leaving and not them.
As Sherlock Holmes once said, I think it was him, Come On Watson The Game is A Foot.
That is how i feel.The cursor is flashing at me, like I should know what the hell it wants.
I am not even sure what I want.
My head hurts, my thoughts wander and the damned things do not even take me with them, that's the shits.Well till I remember to come back.God Bless You & This Country of Ours!!!!

I received a comment from a gentleman whose wife has early stage AD.
It seems this has affected his marriage quite a bit.
Trust me that is an understatement, it has litterally screwed mine up.
I have asked my wife to post her side on the blog, but she is reluctant for whatever reasons.I know that she has one heck of a time with me, I am extremely moody at times, I get lost in conversations and I go off elsewhere in my mind on a dime.
The other day we were talking and as usually Mr.
Brilliant here got lost and could not even get a word out, the wife answered for me and was right.
Her words to me were "Aren't you glad I know you?"
my reply was yes someone has to because I do not know me anymore.
This is starting to get scarey now.
I have been going to post for the last couple of days, just does not happen.
It certainly has messed up our sex life, I cannot even keep things going, because my mind suddenly goes off to War, or the Circus or some such fuckin thing and I am no longer involved in the situation or I just plain fall asleep.I cannot even imagine how my commentor or my wife feel.
I am not even sure how I feel at any given moment.
At times I am on my game and then there is no game I have lost my processes and cannot get back.
Yes I can write because I can stop and come back and start over, but in my real world it just does not work that way.To my friend I am truly sorry for your situation, I will not say Hey it is ok it will be fine, because the truth is it will not get better only worse.
I do hope the Lord continures to give you the strength you need for each day, we are a hand full.God Bless You & This Country of Ours!Joe

Message = HelloI work at a local Alzheimer Society .......... My co-workers and I have been watching the HBO series over our lunch hour.
I wanted to stop by and visit your blog.
Thank you for having the courage to share your story so publically.
You have made such a huge difference for other people with ADRD because you have put a face behind this disease.
Your story is particularly important because it shows that anyone can get Alzheimer's disease...even someone as accomplished as you.Not everyone is interested in being the "poster child" for Alzheimer's disease (for lack of a better phrase).
It is such a personal journey.
Thank you for the courage and commitment to do this.Our chapter is marking it's ....
Anniversary this year.
In fact we are having a ... on ....... with over 150 people attending it (i.e., to honour the occasion).
There are so many people who have touched the chapter...be it person's with Dementia, their family, volunteers and staff.
There are so many people who are working towards improving the quality of life all of those affected by Alzheimer's disease.
I know that each of them would send you and your family their well-wishes.I have worked at the chapter for about half that time.
During that time, there have been incredible strides in research and public awareness about Alzheimer's disease.
It is encouraging to see this but we all know that there is so much more that needs to be done.
Your story will bring much needed awareness to this disease and will help to move things one step further in search of a cure.Anyway, I just wanted to say hello and THANK YOU!Sending you and your family warm thoughts...I have removeed info that would id this person to keep them anoynomous.
I am using this email because I have received countless numebers that call me the face of alhzeimers and the voice.
I am neither.
Just a person with this fricken disease who wants to share our side of the story with you.I have asked all of you for pics and dates of you loved ones that passted from this disease, as all of us with it do.
I received one.
So I will be posting it.
You see those before me are the face and voice of this disease and should be remmembered and I want this blog to pay tribute to their fight for life.
I get tired of hearing about all the big people who have survived this and that, big fuckin deal.
We all die period.
I am tired of all the crap about cures and how to stop this disease, well prove it to me with a survivor of it.
No matter the advancements the real cause and any real treatment exscapes the med prof., maybe someday, I wonder.I hope Bill's daughter does not take offense at the pic that I have because hers did not come through so I took one from his site.
To me it shows the real heart of the man and how he felt about this disease and inate love of life.God Bless You & This Country of Ours!!!!!!
!JoePS: I received a very sad email of the passing of one in my World, but it is sad for the daughter, for mom she is free now.
The whole left of years of caregiving will be difficult I believe at best to deal with.
To you my love and prayers.

I have become very confused oevr this.
It seems that what I think (have to be easy there) and others is different.
Maybe because it is more difficult to talkto me and keep things on track and the fact that I get angry easier has changed things betweeen me and others.
I always thought and still do that you are honest totally with a friend and not afraid to be calllled on your BS and not afraid to call them on it.
That seems to be a problem in theis world today.
It is costing me friends.
Even trying to explain things to them doe snot work.
I guess this is going to be a new part of my life that I am going to have as this keeps getting harder.I am still waiting for pics and info to start the memorial post for those that have proceeded me and are now at rest.
I think they are the faces of this disease.
Their fight was bvaliant and brave, they fought and tried against a foe that is not beatable at this time.
They are my heroes for hanging in ass long as they could.
They helpeed to pave the road I have to travel and  I thank them for making it a little easier for me.
The millions that suffer now and to come are my family now.This is my story on this blog, but I want it to be a home for you as well.
That is why things haveeeve ben changing and will continue to do so.
Those of you that take care of us extreemely unpredictable persons, need an outlet and I am going to try and succeed with you help making this blog one outlet for you.
It maybe moving to more of a website and changing the address, so that it can be more interactive for you who take the time to read my ramblings and need to converse with otherers in your position.I have to stop now, my brain is not holding thoughts rifht now.God Bless You and This Country of Ours!Joe

I am glad I have some, they help remind me of what my postit notes seem to fail to do.
I have not written in while.
I have been elsewhere lately, not ecxalty sure where, but I have been there.
Getting more tests, health is well not what is used to be.
Age this disease, rotten lyfestyle when I was youndger who knows, I do not.
What is starting to show more offten then not, is I have no idea what day it is and yesterday seems not to have happened.
Hard to explain.
But there is no longer any time frame in my brain to connnect things to, so they all seem recent and mixed up.
True moments of knowing exactly what I am thinking or doing are growing fewer by the day.
This is not a lot of fun and am starting to looose my humor about it.
But I am getting to meet someone new each day in the mirror, so I guess that is ok.God Bless You and This Country of Ours!Joe

My wife and I were discusing what cognaitve and occupational skills meant.
Because they confuse me.
Of course cognaitve is thinking, record keeping, more complex problem solving, well forget hat one.
Occupational are those things such as typing, cooking, walking and general doing things.
Well we looose on that score to.
At least I still can brush my teeeth without putting the brush up my nose.
That is it for today, whatelse is there.God Bless You and This Country of Ours!Joe

I would like to add a slide show to the side of my blog.
I want to make this a memorial to those who have passed from this disease.
So I am asking you to email me a picture of a friend or loved one with their name and birth and deceased years so I can make the slide show.
I would like to honor those that have gone before me and paid the final price of this disease.
Maybe their faces will prompt those who visit this blog to take some type of action or get involved some way to get those needed to help out (government????).
I hope this is not offensive to anyone, if it is well then.Thank you in advance.
jolynn1@cox.net  is the email to send to.God Bless You & This Country of Ours!Joe

How I got this is beyond me but it may help some of you.
You wil nk I did not write thsi spellings is to good.
Hope it helps.Welcome to the Combination Care for Alzheimer's programAs a caregiver for someone who is living with Alzheimer's disease, your role is to make sure your loved one is getting the most effective treatment possible.
This means using a combination of approaches--medication combined with other activities can help expand what you're already doing.
By enrolling in this program you'll have access to information and resources that can help you learn more about the disease and treatments you may not have considered, such as combination therapy.
(Combination therapy is when two Alzheimer's disease medications are used together to increase the benefits of treatment).Based on what you told us when you enrolled, we have created a personalized Doctor Discussion Guide just for you.
This guide offers important tips that can help you work with the doctor and talk openly about your loved one's condition and treatment plan.
It also offers a series of questions that may help you have an informed conversation about how you can continue to enhance your loved one's care.
As timewith the doctor can be limited, the personalized Doctor Discussion Guide can help you maximize your office visits.Please PRINT this Doctor Discussion Guide now, review it, and make note of any topics you'd like to discuss at your next doctor's appointment.
Beyond this, you will also receive a series of personalized emails over the next two months, providing you with educational and supportive information on how you can enhance your loved one's care.
They will also help you learn about ways you can look after yourself as you continue managing your loved one's disease.Doctor Discussion Guide:Your Role as a Caregiver Is Essential.
As you continue to care for someone living with Alzheimer's disease, it's important that you work as a partner with the doctor.
Your doctor relies on you to communicate openly about how your loved one is doing and how treatment is working.
The more information you can provide the more you'll be able to help your loved one get treatment that will make life more manageable for both of you.One treatment option that you and your doctor may want to consider is combination therapy.
In the treatment of moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease, doctors may prescribe a combination of medications, Namenda(r) (memantine HCl)* and Aricept(r) (donepezil)**, when they believe it will be more effective than a single Alzheimer's medicine alone.
Use the following tips and questions to have an informeddiscussion about whether combination therapy may be the right option for the person you care about.Questions to Ask the Doctor:When it comes to treatment:1.
What additional treatment options are available for Alzheimer's disease?2.
Based on the treatments we've tried before, is there anything more we can be doing?3.
I understand there is an option called "combination therapy."
Can you tell me about it?4.
What are the benefits of combination therapy?When it comes to daily living:1.
In addition to medication, are there any lifestyle changes that you would recommend?2.
What type of mental activities will help my loved one?3.
What type of physical activities will help my loved one?4.
Can you tell me what types of support services in my area are available to us, such as in-home assistance, adult day care, assisted livingfacilities, etc.?5.
Can you recommend a support group in my area for caregivers like me?Tips for Partnering with Your Doctor Keep track of changes in your loved one's behavior--It may seem obvious and you may have been doing it for a while, but it's very useful for you to track and tell your doctor about any changes in your loved one's behavior and symptoms such as increased difficulty in performing everyday tasks, agitation, or even increased deficits in intellect and reasoning.
Ask family members or friends if they notice any changes that you may miss.
And, if you aren't already, consider keeping a journal or diary to note any changes in behavior, so you can share this information with the doctor.
You can also write notes on this Doctor Discussion Guide and take it with you to your next appointment.Prepare for doctor visits ahead of time--Taking the time to write down any questions or concerns you have can help make your office visits more productive.
You may also want to bring articles or online resources that you have found with you to the appointments.
This way the doctor is aware of what you're learning and where you are finding additional information.Listen carefully to the doctor and take notes--To be sure that you clearly understand everything the doctor tells you and that you remember it once you leave the appointment, it's helpful to take notes.
You can take notes on this Doctor Discussion Guide.
You may alsowant to consider using a tape recorder or bringing a friend or family member with you.Think about yourself too--It may be difficult to consider yourself when so much of your energy is spent caring for someone else, but by staying healthy you're better able to provide the care your loved one needs.
Don't hesitate to ask your doctor what you can be doing to take care of yourself so you stay strong too.Notes:*Namenda is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease.Namenda(r) (memantine HCl) is a registered trademark of Forest Laboratories, Inc.**Aricept(r) (donepezil HCl tablets) is a registered trademark of Eisai Co., Ltd. and Pfizer Inc.(c) 2008 Forest Laboratories, Inc.Welcome to the Combination Care for Alzheimer's programGod Bless You & This Country of Ours!Joe

Chat seems to be working out ok. Have gotten to talk with some nice people.
One in particular a 21 yr old woman in Boston, who at her age has taken on the daunting task of working in an Assisted Living Facility and going to host an Alhziemer's Proget meeting.
I know what it takes to work in such a facility, you see that is where my mind was made up at an early age, while I handle the computer systems for 3 facilities, never would I live the way I saw.
My heart broke working there.I have gotten a few that well shall we say have not been really forward, challenge them and they disappear, oh well.I have been told to write a bok about this journey and I hae tried but you know I thought about it and said yes good ideaa.
But then I started to think, something ya thnik.
I am writing a book here, completely unedited.
Certainly not proof read and things but neatly.
But this is a living book ever changing, always wanted to write one andnow my brain realizes after how many years at this, that I am.A little slower on the uptake these days.
Well now, I lost my train and my thoughts, fuck I hate this shit.

Wanted to say thanks to those of you taht have used the chat link, it has been fun for me.
I think when i request it and the icon goes acros the screeen it scares people out, because they leave.
I must admit it has woren me out.
I am talking with some folks I hope to put a full time live chat room on.
My hope is that it will give those who come to might site a chance to exchange ideas of this disease.
Mabee it will help some of you caregivers to have others to talk to and help release some of your frustrations.
Hell I know we with the disease are a handful.
I find as it is progressing that I am less talkative to others, cut them off or just go to my own world and leave them out.Physically it is getting more demanding as well, was not prepared for this part and it pisses the hell out of me.
I get to ill easily, to faint and way to exhausted.
Shopping is not something I tolerate well at all anymore.
But there are those that are worse off than I, but I am sure I will goin them soon, the way things are progressing.
Even these entries tire me out, takes to much concentration that is getting harder to hold onto.Well enough pitty potty.
You all have a great and wonderful day.God Bless You & This Country of Ours (we need it now)!Joe

When you come to site you can click on the blue Live Chat and we can talk.
Aslo if you do not the system notifies me that someone is on my blog and I can invite you.
What happens is this beautiful young lady in a box (my alter ego) comes across the screen says her name is Jane and Hello and asks if you need help.
Actually that is me inviting you to talk.
Just click start chat or no thanks.
Sorry if the hi tech scares you, but I am having fun with it, of course the folks in Israel you created this program meant it for companies and they have spent hours explaining things to me.
This am I am ok, will see what the rest of the day holds.
Be Good.

This came from a friend of mine, who knows there is not much upstairs anymore and that I love old jokes and humor.A distraught senior citizen phoned her doctor's office.
'Is it true,' she wanted to know, 'that the medication you prescribed has to be taken for the rest of my life?
''Yes, I'm afraid so,' the doctor told herThere was a moment of silence before the senior lady replied, 'I'm wondering, then, just how serious is my condition because this prescription is marked 'NO REFILLS'.'

There once was a tmie I could answer that but not anylonger.
I have for the last several months porued myself into trying to start some things for the family to help make their financial future better.
However, I remember the comment I made in the HBO thing, Once I was a genius, now I'm not.
How true, it seems that once what I touched I mad work and well, now it goes to hell in a hand basket.
My thoughts seem to be of the same charge and push each other out of the way, leaving avoid for confusion.
That is the disease at work and having a good time of it.
I find myself much more pissy and angry now, but I try to keeep the old trap shut and carry it alone.
I am beginning to understand why we in this World of Ours, just sit alot and say nothing or just wander.
We no longer have a grasp on things, what is real is it, I don't know any longer.
I do not want to say things to family and friends because I don't want the constant hovering or them walikng on eggs.
Frankly i do not know what I want, who I really am, where I have been or am going.
Things from the past seem to be from yesterday and yesetrday seems to be the past.
I feel truly helpless for the first time in my life.
Where do we go from here?

Some or many of you know I quit drivnig a long time ago, by my choice because of the danger I was, then my drs.
told me not too, they were a litttle behind the curve.
Well now the check book has a problem, ME.
so the wife has to take that ove now.
See they call this MCI (mild cognetive impairment), up my ass.
Come live in my brain and tell me how mild this bull is.
See how you like it when you stand up turn around and do not know where the hell you are or the wall hits your face or your world spins.
Get lost in the talk you are havngi.
Set and stare at the computer and not know why you are looking at it.
MCI explains it all.
The Dr. who first coined this phrase had brain cell farts in my book and sure didn't know mild from a hole in the ground.
But of course he knows it to be so, he is smart, right.Well let me go I need to practice for Moderat Cognitive Impairment, so I don't know what the fuck or what the hell I am doing.
That should be fun.All you caregivers remember MCI and see how you think of it.
Your thoughts much welcomed.
By the way you Drs.
and Holistic nits that send me your causes and cures go away, I have checked out studies and they do not work.
Some provide a year or so of added time, then the person is right where they should have been, big service you do.
Yes, I was told how herpes causes AD and then had an advertisement at the end of the email for vits and herbs to help cure and slow down.
I guess I must really come across as a moron and totaly stupid.
But this posts are getting harder and I am getting more, well less friendly and tired.God Bless,Joe

You know, no you don't, but this damn disease is a real bitch at times.
I find myself having to seperate and kind of hide to keep from lashing out.
We have had our one daughter and grand kids and son in law with us almost 3 weeks I think, am not handlin this well.
I love them, but.My wife and I are starting to lock horns more, she thought my last post was rather mean and spiteful, I think that is how she put it.
My reply was, well you guessed it eat shit and bark at the moon.
I write what I feel and how I see it.
It may be clouded it maybe one sided, but it is all I know.
I make no excuses for what and how I put it.
Those that live in this World with me, they know, they understand and hopefully I say what they cannot at least for now, while I am able to .
Yes I am angry as I write this today, better to put it here than where else I might.Ino We that live with AD, really find ourselves fucked up alot of the time, understanding the real confusion and loss we feel is difficult I know for those on the outside looking in.
See we can not get back to the outside to look in, we are stuck here and sinking deeper.
Try to imagine the darkness starting to encase you slowly and you cannot stop it and you want out and NO not for you.
What is that old saying when Casey at The Bat struck out, there is no joy in mudville.Well enough from me.
You all have a great day and wonderful life.God know the idiots in Washington won't fix it, but only screw us more.joeGod Bless You & This Country of Ours!

I have beeen reaing some of the blogs I follow this morning, which I can do from inside my blog.
I get disturbed easily, especially by those in the "Medical Practice" and what they try to push.
These are the very people (not necessarily the ones I read) that have told somany that live with me in theis World of Mine, that we were ok, just anxious, depressed and absent minded.
See we did not fit in their fuckin little box, we did not adhere to pages 89-101 so we could not have any form of dementia.
Now some of them have joined us in this world of ours and are bitching that people say they cann't have it because, THE BOX, is square not distorted.
Mean this may sound but, you diserve to hear that crap your profession spit out at me and thousands like me.
I make no appologies for letting you know how I feel, you see my life is worth just as muchas yours and I am loosing it more and more each day.
It is harder for me to talk, walk and maintain train of thought in a conversation.
I even forget who the people are around me more now.
Probably by this time next year, if I am still around, my body will be here, but I will not.
Alhziemers is doing its job on me and having a good time at it.I saw a youtube asking fatso Oprah to help.
This woman is only interested in her money and famous friends that may have this disease or know someone that does, than she does a show on it.
It just discusts me to beg such people.
It is us who do these blogs and what HBO did for us that is going to make the difference.
Yeah the baby boomers are getting worried, WHY?, because a whole hell of alot of them are starting and will joine us here in the World of Forgetfullness.
Where we these people when we cried out for help, toooo busy to hear us.Wait till you look at your wife or children and have no idea why these people are in your house and what the hell do they want.
Then the old mind comes back and you know you left, you want terror there it is.
Come walk with me in my World and see how brown the grass is.God Bless You & This Country of Ours!!

I was sittting here reading my last entry, I knew something was wrong with it, but I had to study my own hands to figrue it out.
It should have read starting on the left.
See I do not know my right from my left anymore.
Might be one reason I don't drive anymore and I turn into the wall when walking.
I think I have it right now, if not you figure it out I am done.You know this thing is gettting the better of me, we knew it would happen.
I am having greater difficulty in remebering what day it is and am getting lost in conversations more often now.
I am trying to follow the note that hangs on my computer desk that just says BLOG.
I feel that I will soon not be doing this, having too much trouble with my thoughts, fingers and the friken keybaord.So much for my crab, you all have a great ad wonderful life.God Bless You & This Country of Ours!Joe

I sure many thougt I would not follow up on my distain with Google, but I have a very angry side to me, especially when being called a thief.
Years ago maybe, now no way.
So here is to google, using spell & grammar checker so they could understand.
Also, no answer from them yet.
No balls I guess.April 28, 2009Mr.
Eric SchmidtChairman of the Board & Chief Executive OfficerGoogle1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy.Mountain View, CA  94043Dear Mr. Schmidt:I am sure that you maybe wondering why there is a check for $0.81 attached to this letter.Well there is a good reason for that, I do not appreciate being basically called a thief and a purveyor of illegal intent of taking funds from anyone.
This blood money is repayment for what I was paid by Google Ad sense, because someone unknown to me was clicking on the ads on my blog.
I presume from the insulting email I received from your outfit, they were not justified.
I appealed, since I did not even know that I was to get paid, and basically as far as I am concerned was called a liar and complicter by your staff.You see I suffer from Alzheimer's and Frontal Temporal Lobe Dementia.
I have a blog located at http://living-with-alzheimers.blogspot.com/.
On this site I tell of how the disease affects me and how I cope with it.
I started it to help caregivers, physicians and those whose loved ones suffer from the disease, what it is like in Our World.
Maybe in a small way giving them some comfort as to how it is not their fault and that they could do very little.I thought Adsense would be good, because it listed sites and places for people to go on my blog as well as in the posting.
The ads were pertinent to the blog and entries.
This was my whole thrust.
But YOUR PEOPLE, I guess felt I was just trying to steal from you.
So hence I return the $0.81 to you, I would not want your firm to suffer any financial hardship over this, or your dog not be able to eat because of it.As a point of interest, The Wall Street Journal thought enough of me and my integrity to feature my blog in the paper.
HBO Media also has honored me by including me in their The Alzheimer's Project, which airs in May 2009.
By the way you can find the information on Google.I remain,Joseph Potocny

For some reason many of you have called me hero, courgeous, generous spirt, wonderful person and all type of kind things.
Truly I am none of these, just another one among millions with this fricken disease.
No cure, no real meds, no real scientific finds, just one end.
At firstm many thought I was bitter orver it, I never have been.
Pissed at a medical profession that would not get its head out of its ass and listen yes.
You see it is just my turn, I was called and well I answered, oh well.
Often wanted to write my life story, maybe that is teh real reason behind this blog, I do not know.
Now I have difficulty putting it into a time frame since time does not exist for me the same as it does for you.
I was going to callthe booke THROUGH THE LAUGHTER, HE HEARD MY TEARS!
So much for that.If you want to know who and what I really am, there is a post 08/0/2008 called A Warrior's Lament, an attempt at a poem by me saying where I have been and am and a post 09/29/2007 Farwell To My Old Friend Pain, to post is self explaining I thing.Well Lakes to HBO this blog has been buzing.
They are the Heroes for doing the series that needed to be done.
Five hours cannot cover it all, but they did a one heck of a knock up job.
Shit the brought back long lost friends to me because of it, I sure benefited by it.
Well tooo much rambling.God Bless You & This Country of Ours!joe

I hav been deeply moved an honored by the number of people that have wirttin me and sent me emails over the last few days.
The words used pay me an honor that I do not deserve.
I am but one of many on the journey, I jus am able still to let you know hte rotten side of it here.
In watching the HBO special, the real heros were the kids, I cried over their pain and frustration and the absolute resolve they had to love their grandparents and want ing to understand.
See you have the tuff part, we just keep forgetting and reach a point that nothing matters as it once did.
Someday, they may really know what causes this and may even find a way to stop it, reverse it I do not think so.
But wha the hell we are talking about me thinking.
I have one brain cell and more than one thought causes a traffic jam and I get totally messed up and confused.
It is harder for me to talk these days, words come out kind of liek my typeing.
If I get to it today or the nxet couple of days I will be adding some links to other blogs for you to read.Till next we meet.God Bless You and This Country of Ours!joe

Last night and I need to do this while it is still fresh or atleast somewhat fresh in my brain, my Wife & I had the privilege of seeing the premier screeening in LA of the first part of the HBO series The Alzhiemers Project.
What a job they did.
I am humbled that I was a part of this movie.
It truly shows a side that few people know about for thoose that live in this World of Mine, with me.
It was done with style, grace, compassion and an understanding of what we go through.AGAIN WOW!!!!
Thank You for asking me to be a part of it.God Bless You & This Country of Ours!

The littttle one is my one granddaughter Lillian.
You know I am finding it more and more diffficult to maintain images in my mind of those I once knew and loved and even those that I care about and love now.
A feeling of urgency is starting to take hold in my life.
What it means I do not know.
All final arragnements have been made and paid for, so that is not a concern any longer.
I do not want to be around people much anymore, it is gettinng harder to tolerate them, I am sure I am no prize either now, probably neverr was.
At first I told this disease of mine, that you may win, but you will know you have been in one hell of a fricken fight.
Seems I am the one with the wounds and they don't heal or go away.
Well soo much for my rambling.God Bless You & This Country of Ours!joe

On this date HBO will start the firsst in a 4 part series on Alzhiemers.
As you know I prefer to call it dementia.
As the council on aging testified in March to Congress, THEY DO NOT KNOW WHAT EVEN CAUSES IT.
Yet they feel thaat with the right structure and funds there could be the possibility of delaying its onset.
It is finnally being recognized and called a disease and not just of the aged.
Maria Schiver gave a moving talk, but the gentleman from Florida much more touch me with the story of his wife diagnosed at 55, about 65 now I am guessing no longer remembers him and the pain of it.
He also talked about those who are not wealthy like Maria, face challenges of care that she can afford.
I am not taking things from her, the devestation of her father is real and painful for the family.
But I still do not believe the caregivers truly understand the pain and frustration and anger of it in this World.
You go along ok for awhile.
Then you fall down a part of the stairs.
You go to get back up the stairs, but no way, they are gone lost forever and so has part of yourlife and who you are disappeared.
Epedemic they call it, try PANDEMIC, with more than 10 million in this country alone suffering.
These people did state a real truth, when you have seen one case of AD, you have seen just one case.
We all progress differently.
And as they said 'YOU WILL NOT SEE ANY SURVIVORS OF AD WALKING AROUND".
THERE ARE NONE!!!!!!!
Welcom eo My WorldI have got nasty lately on my blog and truly do not care, it is part of wo and what I amm becoming.
BUT I AM PROUD TO SAY THAT I AM PART OF THE DOCUMENTARY THAT WILL BE SHOWN ON HBO IN MAY.
I thank them for having the balls to truly attack this head on.
KUDOS HBO.If science has or ever gets the courage to take live brain cels so they can truly start to find out how this plague works, I AM READY AND WILLING TO LET THEM GO AT MY BRAIN, it is becoming of smaller and smaller value to me.God Bless You & This Country of Ours!joe

These are additional resources for you to click and go to.
I do not select them, GOOGLE does, so that they fit the blogs content.
It has been difficult for me of late.
I am trying to make my blog more informtavie for all.
The reason for the adds.
Actually they are sites for you to visit and garner what info you can from them.
It is my way of saying thank you for visiting me here.The image is about Our Country.

Beeen somewhere for ahwile but not exactlly sure where.
Have been attempting to build sume businesses on-line for the family for xtra income, once I cross that line.
I feel it coming closer each day.
I am really getting to be a pain.
I have been arguing Politics whith a friend and have not been exactly kind in what I have said.
He supports the Pres.
and I do not trust him as far as I can throw an Elephant.OOh well so much for that.
The Joe that started this blog cple of years ago is not here anymore.
Infact the one that wrote her last year is gone.
This is the part of the loss of me (dying) that bohters me, who will I become and what.
Death of my body does not bother me, in fact it will be a blessing.
I know my family is making memmories with me for when I am not here and that makes me happy.
My youngest daughter, cut my hair.
She called it a caldusec look, because we buzzzes the topand just trimed the sides.
The name is because we live on a caldusac.
When the sides stand up, because combing is not in my world, my wife calls me Albert, because I remind her of Albert Einstein, not bad company.
Well you all have fun.God Bless You & This Country of Ours!

No wonder it took so long to get to the truth, I went to the wrong medical practioners.
I received the following from a friend.TWO DIFFERENT DOCTORS' OFFICESBoy, if this doesn't hit the nail on the head,I don't know what does!Two patients limp into two different medical clinics with the same complaint..
Both have trouble walking and appear to require a hip replacement.The FIRST patient is examined within the hour, Is x-rayed the same day and has a time booked for Surgery the following week.The SECOND sees his family doctor after waiting 3 weeks for an appointment, then waits 8 weeks to see a specialist, then gets an x-ray, which isn't reviewed for another weekand finally has his surgery scheduled for a month from then.Why the different treatment for the two patients?The FIRST is a Golden Retriever.The SECOND is a Senior Citizen.Next time take me to a vet!

A new president willl take office in ten days I think it is.
When I first got the wonderful news of this new paradise that I am to lvie in, it did not bother me too much.
I felt that as with ofther things it was just my turn, deal with it.
It was not bad at first I had many good days with small moments in them and then days that just who the hell knows where I was.
But they have seemed to merge together.
Truly I have a proble with what day it is, even though I keep a calendar by my computer and mark the days off.
I have gone back to sticky notes, but the real kick is remembering to use this stuff.
I am not angry with the condition, but it really plays hell with you.
I do not venture out alone, who knows where I will be.
I find spending lengths of time with outrthers becoming quite uncomfortable and extremely distracting.
My patients, which I never had, just does not handle it well.
I am loosing my train here, so I guess I will go wait for a bus.

The folowing is form some friends of mine, slightly more mature than I and walk in my World.
Though I forget many of a friend until I get an email, it still amazesss me that you can grow to love and care about those you have never seen or shared a spoekn word with.HOW TRUE IT ISAnother year has passedAnd we're all a little older.Last summer felt hotterAnd winter seems much colder.I rack my brain for happy thoughts,To put down on my pad,But lots of things, That come to mindJust make me kind of sad.There was a time not long agoWhen life was quite a blast.Now I fully understandAbout 'Living in the Past'..We used to go to friends homes,Baseball games and lunches.Now we go to therapy, to hospitals,And after-funeral brunches.We used to have hangovers,From parties that were gay.Now we suffer body achesAnd sleep the night away.We used to go out dining,And couldn't get our fill.Now we ask for doggie bags,Come home and take a pill.We used to travel oftenTo places near and far.Now we get backachesFrom riding in the car.We used to go out shoppingFor new clothing at the MallBut, now we never bother...All the sizes are too small.That, my friend is how life is,And now my tale is told.So, enjoy each day and live it up...Before you're too darn old!!
HAPPY NEW YEAR& thanks for making my days enjoyable by your Blog and e-mails funny or sad .

I use to get many more emails and comments on my postings, with over 12,000 visitors I brain thinks I would hear more.
I guess maybe of late I have tried to show too much humor and people want the gore.
Well the humor is howw I keepp my self together.
Without it thiss life would be darn near unbearabel.
I is no fun trust me sitting here tryiing to write to you and tell you that the wolrd really sucks.I does not get out of my head to the keyboard when I want it to.
Tihngs do not get better here, they just slowly go down hill.
I read all the new studiies and new stuff to try and I really laugh at this so calllled professionals.
They all contradict each other, I wonder if they are not suffers as well.
March to stamp out Alhzeimers, RIGHT!
Asses don't even know what really causes it to start wity, great progress in over 100 years.
I am not thrilled with having AD & FTD, but that is the way it is period.
You should try it some day, look at people you have been with for 30+ years and not even know who they are, let alone what the hell they are talking about.

Yes it is that time of year again.
For me Thanksgiving seems years ago.
Time no longer has a start and finish for me.
Well it will be here soon, probably sooner than I think and be gone before I know it was here.
This year has been fillled with manny things for me.
Or I think it was, I am no longger sure of it.
But I still awake each day and breathe, I might looose most of the day but I am still there somewhere for it.
Funny somedays I feel in total control and then for days I have no idea what is going on.
I try to get to this each day, but at last it does not work that way.
Early or not at all for the most part.

This is how I feel in the World of mine, like a droppped call or just the buzzing on the line.
The thoughts are there but the connection to the jaw finds a dead zone.
No messeages come or go out.
It gets frustrating as you talk and sudddenly the line goes dead and your jaw stops and you look at the person and you choke up trying to get the words out and suddenly even the thought is gone.
Emptiness in the brain cell.
It happens when trying to write on this blog, I sit and have things to say and then the brain, fingers and keys on the keyboard become strangers.
I go nowhere without someone with me, not good idea.
Now the family worries because of the heart problems, I just look at it as one moore thing to add to the list, someday I will get through the list and have to start over, why, because i won't remember the beginning of it, so I will not know if I got to the end.
This all makes perfect sense to me.
But then so does waxy ear build up, whatever the hell that means.
I know I do like hearing from folks who stop by and take the time to read my babble, strange humor and other things.If you want to know about me truly, read my post, A Warriors Lament, it tells about me from beginning to where I am at now.You may not understand it, but I do and that is what matters to me.
Well for now have fun and be kind to yourself.God Bless You & This Country of Ours!JoePS:  VOTE TOMORROW - I HAVE ALREADY.

an email that was forwarded to me.
my life in a nutshell.
AAADD        KNOW THE SYMPTOMS.....
PLEASE READ        Thank goodness there's a name for this disorder.
Somehow I feel better even though I have it.
Recently, I was diagnosed with A.A.A.D.D.
-        Age Activated Attention Deficit Disorder.
This is how it manifests:        I decide to water my garden.
As I turn on the hose in the driveway,        I l ook over at my car and decide it needs washing.
As I start toward the garage,        I notice mail on the porch table that        I brought up from the mail box earlier.
I decide to go through the mail before I wash the car.
I lay my car keys on the table,        put the junk mail in the garbage can under the table,        and notice that the can is full.
So, I decide to put the bills back        on the table and take out the garbage first.
But then I think,        since I'm going to be near the mailbox        when I take out the garbage anyway,        I may as well pay the bills first.
I take my check book off the table,        and see that there is only one check left.
My extra checks are in my desk in the study,        so I go inside the house to my desk where        I find the can of Pepsi I'd been drinking.
I'm going to look for my checks,        but first I need to push the Pepsi aside        so that I don't accidentally knock it over.
The Pepsi is getting warm,        and I decide to put it in the refrigerator to keep it cold.
As I head toward the kitchen with the Pepsi,        a vase of flowers on the counter        catches my eye--they nee d water.
I put the Pepsi on the counter and        discover my reading glasses that        I've been searching for all morning.
I decide I better put them back on my desk,        but first I'm going to water the flowers.
I set the glasses back down on the counter,        fill a container with water and suddenly spot the TV remote.
Someone left it on the kitchen table.
I realize that tonight when we go to watch TV,        I'll be looking for the remote,        but I won't remember that it's on the kitchen table,        so I decide to put it back in the den where it belongs,        but first I'll water the flowers.
I pour some water in the flowers,        but quite a bit of it spills on the floor.
So, I set the remote back on the table,        get some towels and wipe up the spill.
Then, I head down the hall trying to        remember what I was planning to do.
At the end of the day:        the car isn't washed        the bills aren't paid        there is a warm can of Pepsi sitting on the counter        the flowers don't have enough water,        there is still only 1 check in my check book,        I can't f ind the remote,        I can't find my glasses,        and I don't remember what I did with the car keys.
Then, when I try to figure out why nothing got done today,        I'm really baffled because I know I was busy all day,        and I'm really tired.
I realize this is a serious problem,        and I'll try to get some help for it,        but first I'll check my e-mail....        Do me a favor.
Forward this message to everyone you know,        because I don't remember who the hell I've sent it to.
Don't laugh -- if this isn't you yet, your day is coming By the way don't forget to VOTE!God Bless You & This Country of Ours!joe

It is beocming harder each day to remember yesterday, let alone try today, even this monring.
Here we are mid October per the calendar and I am somewere in September.
I feel like I am altogether but I am totallly confused as to what to do next.
This is not fun.
But it is the hand I was dealt so I play the cards and see what they do and try to understand them.
The new meds seem to help the pains in the chest and the sweating whrn walking or doing some work.
So I gues complaining is just whimpy on my part.
I wish I had the words to discribe what it is like to be in this World that I and others like me live in.
It reallly sucks.
First you know then you forget and then you do not remember forgetting what it was that you knew.
If tha makes no sense to you ok, but it does to me.
My frustration with others is growing and I go off more quickly then usual.
I started this today with my thoughts all together and now they are some where in space and time.
Did use postit notes but I found I did not read them or kept doing them over and over, now who knows what works.
My brain sure does not know and many times I just don't give a damn, it is to hard to put the thoughts together.
It is easier to just leave the old grey matter alone.
Till next time.God Bless You and This County Of Ours!joe

I thought that with all the humor of the elections that we, even us with this damn disease could use a laugh.
The following is from a friend of mine in Britian, I hope you find the humor as I did.
Bus Ride >      >>      >>     A little something for you to get your mind off your troubles for a minute!>>     ACTUAL AUSTRALIAN COURT DOCKET 12659 ---CASE OF THE PREGNANT LADY  >>>      >>     A lady about 8 months pregnant got on a bus.
She noticed the man opposite her was smiling at her.
She immediately moved to another seat.
This time the smile turned into a grin, so she moved again.
The man seemed more amused.
When on the fourth move, the man burst out laughing, she complained to the driver and he had the man arrested.>>     The case came up in court.
The judge asked the man (about 20 years old) what he had to say for himself.
>>     The man replied, 'Well your Honor, it was like this, when the lady got on the bus, I couldn't help but notice her condition.
She sat down under a sign that said, 'The Double Mint Twins are coming' and I grinned.
Then she moved and sat under a sign that said,' Logan 's Liniment will reduce the swelling,' and I had to smile.
Then she placed herself under a deodorant sign that said, 'William's Big Stick Did the Trick,' and I could hardly contain myself.
But, Your Honor, when she moved the fourth time and sat under a sign that said, 'Goodyear Rubber could have prevented this accident'...
I just lost it.

Golden Years, right fillled with AD, FTD, BiPolar, Sinus Problems, cannn't see worth a damn and no left ear drum.
I forget it means gold crowns not porcelian or metal, gold hip joints, gold nee joints and oh yes golden colored build up in your arteries, aren't the Golden Years fantastic.
Up my patooty.
I found out today that the bottom portion, the tip area of my heart does not get any blood, so I could have a heart attack, not onew that would kill me, but probably wished it would.
So we go on a medical regement and change of eating habits to help correcvt it and if that does not work we become invasive and go in and look.
This is why I have DDS most people call it ED, erctile dysfunction, I call it dead dick sysdrome.
It stands up and salutes then dies.
Well I guess soon I won't remember what it is for anyhow, I am starting to have vague memories of what it was used for.
Well I am still breathing so it is ok. Just had to expound on this crap for a minute.
I thank you all for listening and being out there for all of us in my World.God Bless You and This Country of Ours!Joe

Since I have been so blessedd with these wonderful diseasess it is strange to me how I have been changing and changing towards others.
I am not to concerned with what they think or have to say.
I am getting more self absorbed you could say.
I am not sure if this is part of the way this thing goes, but it is how I am starting to feel, it is as if others do not exist in my World, hard to describe this feeling as my commmand of the language is going to hell in a hand basket.
I more and more do not enjoy going out and having people around me.
The noisse and all the hurry scurryy around me tendsl to set me off and I have to get away from it.
I know because of the hlep that my famliy has given me, I have fallen in love with my wife and the rest of my family all over again.
I find when I am extreemly focused on something that I can talk and wright quiet well.
But that amount of concentraation is greatly tiring and causes me to become unsteady for awhile.
My mind is starting to ramble to I will say good bye for now.God Bless You and This Country of Ours!joe

Wow here it is amlost the midlddle of September, where have I been.
It seems like as each day passes I become less and less aware of the day, date, week, month or the time.
It is all seemilgy running together.
It is like today is almost a repeat of yesterday.
I now have problems with some of my conversations, my tongue seems to get in the way and I get all screwed up in what I am saying, so I gust wave my hands and say latter.
Which of course latter does not come because I for get what I was saying in the first place.
It seems to be this whole time affect first forward then backwards, drives me nuts (that is a short drive).
I find that i get more irritable as time goes on, I try to handle it but well sometimes that is just the way things happen.
I did not even realise that we were this far into this mont.
Halloween will be here and I will not know it, except for the candy and the tricker treators.
Well I guess I will go do something, probably something of no importance, but it will be something I think.God Bless You and This Country of Ours!Joe

Message = Joe,First I would like to say that I am sorry for the crappy deck of carded dealt to you.
It seems as if we are looking forward to working ourselves to death to enjoy our older years.
And then this.
It is not very fair at all.I came across your blog while researching Dementia.
My mother-in-law was diagnosed 3 years ago at the age of 51.
She progressed quickly and has now lost the ability to talk and lost her ability to control her bowel movements.
She is trapped in a world all alone.
Do you have any advice on ways to comfort her?
I would like for her to know that no matter if she knows us or not that we still love and care about her.Thank you for your time and I hope for the best for you.
(we will call her)PamSubject: Your MomDear Pamela,Sorry it has taken me so long to get back to you.
I keep trying and keep forgetting or start and go off and start something else.
The nature of this Disease.
Being that your mother and I live in the same World which is different from yours.
I can just imagine your feelings as a caregiver, that is why I started my Blog, so the outside world could get at least to know how it is for one person and help some to understand those they are caring for.
The best you can do for your mom is what you are doing.
Being there for her, talking to her, telling you love her, sitting with her and not speaking, hold her hand, smile at her, keep your tears to yourself, she has too many in her heart to bear yours.
Trust me she know deep inside you are there and helping.
This disease just stops us from responding well and takes our lives away from us.
I know my family gets nuts over me, because I cannot always hold a conversation with them or follow theirs and I forget who the hell they are.
I am pretty outspoken and direct if you really read my blog.
I am offensive at times and I do not care, because I am discussing My World the hell of it.
Be glad on this email I used spell checker, because generally do not I want folks to know how this crap really is.
Any further emails I will not use it, so I hope you are good a picking something apart to understand it.Being there for your Mom is the single best thing you can do for her.
I have told my family and it is in my blog, when I get to close to crossing the line of this disease as your mom has, I will say good bye to all and be gone.
I will not put myself or family or friends through the last stages.
See I worked for a number of nursing homes that had those that could manage on their own and those that needed assisted living care and those who needed accute care, as I was developing this disease.
I still remember going through the lunch room at one of the homes (I took care of three homes computer systems) and watched the attended lift this ladies face out of her food and clean her, never I said at that point would I allow my life to become such a burden and worthless being.
My heart broke that day and I finally noticed the real death of these folks that were around me.
They were gone and someone else was living in them and I cried and said never would I put anyone through that.
But remember that is me and my feelings.I may post this reply on my blog, if you do not mind.
I sometimes use the email people send me and my answers back to them.God Bless and Hold You Tight in His Arms!JoeJoe,Thank you for your response.
You are more than welcome to post this on your blog.
Reading through your eyes has given me perspective.
I hope a lot of other people, especially caregivers, can see this too.
Maybe it will take some of the frustration away.
Maybe it will help people be a little more compassionate and forgiving and a little less annoyed and frustrated.Thank you for your insight.Pamela God Bless You and God Bless This Country of Ours!

Lately i have not told how I feel and what is happening.
So, I feel like shit, the affects of this disease are catching up.
I cannot be out walking and such for more than 1/2 hour or I feel like I am about to leave this pldace.
I find converstions more and more difficult, unless I am truly angry or extremely focused on one point.
Any distratction and I am lost.It is difclut I know for others to understand how hard it can be to hold a conversation, they are draining and hurt.
My trembling is worse, my head spins when I turn in, hitting the ground is quiet annoying and becoming uncofortbale.
Forgetting in the midle of something I am doing really ticks me off to know end, because I cannot get back to where I was, it is just plain gone.
I just hope this blog helps someone.God Bless You and This Country of Ours!joe

I kneel before theeUpon bended kneeMy battle axe rusts upon a treeThe Steed that served me wellNow runs free and frailHe served us both with grace and mightLet him rest well each nightThere is no deadly maceThat you can see before my faceGone is my shield which I cannot holdAll that is before you is my sword and faceI have stood tall in all battlesWith You I have won and battles song sungMany with scars some with noneSince a child I have fought the fightNow I wish for it to end this nightMy strength is dried up and goneNo longer does exist that fierce warrior in meI long to face only TheeThis battle I am in is lost and so am ISo before You I am on bended kneeProstrate would I layBut this body is to broken and brittle this daySo I lay before you all I have leftWorn, beaten, yearning, to you I give my soulNo longer in the dust of battle let me roamI await You and Your Hand to take me in your timeI pray Thee take ME HOMEIn Your Name Amen.Joe

It has been awhile since I posted, I sit down in fromt of this thing to do it and that is wehere it ends.I have been in sort of a place that I am not famliar with, don't ask where because I do not know.
Physically I am starting to suffer more of the progress of this wonderfulo disease.
It is begning to scare me more now.
I stand in the house, and wonder where the hell I am.
After awhile I lie down on the couch or whatever and go to sleep and the hours go away.
So does the confusion and mystery fo what things are.
I feel more lonely in theis World of Mine now even when people are areound me.
Sometimes waking up and seeing my wife next to me scares the living (&(&^^ out of me because I am not sure who she is.
Then the brain kicks in a all is well.
I tire quickly and fall alot now, I guess that old Ford has caught up to me and passed me by.I used to wonder what tomorrow would bring, now I am not sure about the rest of today.
I do this for you who care for those like me so you know why we act the way we do and it has nothing to do with you, it is us.God Bless You and this Country of Ours!Joe

THE POEM    I knelt to pray but not for long,    I had too much to do.
I had to hurry and get to work    For bills would soon be due.
So I knelt and said a hurried prayer,    And jumped up off my knees.
My Christian duty was now done    My soul could rest at ease.....    All day long I had no time    To spread a word of cheer    No time to speak of Christ to friends,    They'd laugh at me I'd fear.
No time, no time, too much to do,    That was my constant cry,    No time to give to souls in need    But at last the time, the time to die.
I went before the Lord,    I came, I stood with downcast eyes.
For in his hands God!
held a book;    It was the book of life.
God looked into his book and said    'Your name I cannot find    I once was going to write it down...
But never found the time'God Bless Your and This Country of Ours!Joe

You know I have asked the above question all of my life.
Not just since I have gotten AD & FTD, to be sure they have not helped the situation.
The question is not what you think, GOD WHY ME?
No not at all.
Most of my life has been screwed up, probably mostly my own fault, except my early childhood, did I have one, no I live in a house of hell part of Satans spawn.
At least with the dementia some of it is leaving me now.
You should see my wife as she tries to stop me from falling off the courch or the bed.
It is hard to stop a rolling whale.
I ask mostly, GOD WHY AM I ALIVE & WHY WAS I BORN?
Looking over me and my life there is nothing special about me nor do I seem to have contributed much to this life, taken oh yes.Now my thoughts get mixed between yesterday, today and whatever comes into this brain of mush that I have.
It is starting to get a bit touchier, I look at those I should know and wonder who the f&*^ is that, and it is my wife or one of the kids.
I have moments that I feel perfectly "normal" (do not think I ever was that), and all of a sudden everything goes to helll in a hand basket and I have no idea what I am doing, why I am doing it or where.
I spend little time doing things I used to.
I start, forget and then wind up somewhere else doing something different or just sitting wondering WHY?
Well enough out of me.God Bless You & This Country of Ours!Joe

I have beeen one of those do it yourselfers, but those days are ending.
Power tools and I are starting to have a new understanding.
You don't pick me up, I will not hurt you.
Helped the Mrs. put up new blinds in my sons room over the weekend.
Those of you that live in earthquaaaake land will understand.
There was a 7.2 quake going on inside me as I shook, rattled and tried to fall out the window.
All this for standing up to put in a total of 10 screws.
Getting to hard to handle that many even one doesnot work.
I think I lost 30 pounds in sweat in the process.
The time was I could paint a straight line with no guide between walls and cieling.
Now we have highways with bends in them.
Forget trying to mortar cracks they stick out like mountains, the crack is better.I guess this all goes with the AD and FTD.
Once had pride in my handy work, now 5 year olds can do just as well.
But I can still vaccuum so there.
The towels get done as long as I remember to turn them on and change from washer to dryer and take them out, now that can take as long as 12 hours..
I go visiting a lot and I am not sure where it is that I go.
I try to keep this light, but it is not any fun.
If I get too awraped up in it I am to much to handle even for myself.
But I knew that this road was to get tougher and rockier and it has not wasted much time.
Well till next time.God Bless You and This Country of Ours!Joe

Some of you may recall me talking about my friend Dirty Butter, real name Rosemary.
A link to her page is on the side of my blog.
This daer lady was given a diagnosis of Parkinsons and some other neuro disease back 2006 or so.
See they, the doctors heard houff beats and immediately saw horses and not the zebra that was in the heard.
Well things progress and finally someone really takes a look at this strange looking horse and after testing and thinking and checking finds that DB does not have Parkinson's afret all but:Essential myoclonus occurs in the absence of epilepsy or other apparent abnormalities in the brain or nerves.
It can occur randomly in people with no family history, but it also can appear among members of the same family, indicating that it sometimes may be an inherited disorder.
Essential myoclonus tends to be stable without increasing in severity over time.
Some scientists speculate that some forms of essential myoclonus may be a type of epilepsy with no known cause.
(this was cut and pasted from dictionary).This is treatable with med, probably will not be cured but her life is becoming beter each day and will continue to.
The jerks, twitches, spasms and the like are supsiding.
I cannot tell you how much joy my heart is filled with for her.
God loves her and so do I.
God Bless You and This Country of Ours!

To all my friends, readers and distractors from whatever Country you live in, I send you belated greetings for the freedom that this Country has always fought for qne hope you enjoyed the day.
To all of you that live in this foggy World of Mine, with AD, FTD, Picks, Lewy Bodies, Parkinsons and just plain old dementia (whatevwer that is) A special hello and thanks to you.
I just was not able yesterday to put it together to write you all.
As things grow tighter in my mind and ability to express them I get more and more frustrqted.
But the good side is that in a short time I forget the frustration.
I feel like I live in 3 Worlds, Yesterday, Something Called Today, and What is To Come (tomorrow).My temperment is slowly becoming unpleasant, I am even more straight forward then I ever was.
I try to say thank you Lord for putting this asshole in my life, but I to offten find myself telling them to eat shit and bark at the moon.
It is difficult to watach what I say around my grandkids, so I try to just sew my lips shut.
Does it work?
EEEEH It is getting harder each day to get my backside in gear to do something.
The Warrior that once existed in me and fought every battle thattt came our way, has finally laid down his lance, his battle axe is rusting, but he is still moving, but I need jiff lube for the armor to stop its fricken squeaking.
I do not want people to feel sorry for me because I don't, my life has been filled with battles and challenges and have risen to them all, I guess it is now my turn to rest and sort of pass the sword on to others.
But I am a stuborn SOB.
To all I say thank you for stopping by to visit with me.
I hope your lives are filled with what the Lord wants for you.God Bless You and This Country of Ours!Joe

Recently I was told this about me telling you about my life with this disease.
The individual even found it funny and without purpose.
Wel that is ok, because I am here for me and for those who care for people like me and are like me.
This is not fun and games this is real life.
It iss difficult to lay out your life and how you feel.
I once started sometime ago I cannot remember when posting my life story on a site, I am but one person in over 6 billion on this earth, who would care.
I started getting so many emails I could not go through one days worth in a day.
I was blunt and just as forthwritht in the story as I try to be here.
You know when you just roll out of bed and land on the floor and are not sure why you are there I try to laugh, yes I do that.
I walk into wals, sit on the floor and just fall over.I hate going past my mailbox alone, it scares me, I am leaving my security place and I actually run back, because I am afraid I will forget where it is.
Sometimes you can talk like the wind with folks other times you just stare and wonder who they hell is this person and what are they doing here.
The problem is you have no control over it.wrighting tihis takes all my ability to consentrate and generally I go to sleep afterwards, my brain fills like it has been crushed, I like some that live in this World of Mine do not want to be here anymore, it hurts to look at those you know, but you cannot talk to them, because the brain and mouth cannot find each other.Emotions are a real mountain, boy when they start to flow, their is no stopping them until you are tottally wiped out.
The pains of the past that you thought were dealt with and now at rest, rear their ugly heads with a vengance.
That is while early on in this ordearl I tried to contact old friends and put things to rest, without telling them what was happening, I got yeah I kind of remember but forget it doesn't matter, thanks but don't call again and out right anger, well that is the way it goes.
If I have the time and my brain stays with me or me with it I think I shall post in segements my life story, for me.
I getting lost now so good bye my friends till next time.God Bless You and This Country of Ours!Joe

Lately I haave found the past getting tangled in my mind, such things as when who why and the like.
My days are becoming shorter as time seems to pass and I am totally unawaree of it.
I have been experiencing great difficulties in keeping old times and folks out of my relationship with my wife, needless to say this is becoming quiet a pain in the ass.
I know it hurts her and it fricken is driving me nuts, to the point I am having a hard time relating to her, especially in a man and woman sense, you know husband and wife tings, the pills do not help, I think my drive and wants are getting screwed up with everything else.
New or what should be new memories do not even stay with me anymore.
I lock my way in sleeping at the drop of a hat, I am beginning not to care anymore, which is part of the FTD and the AD time marches on and I seeem to stand still.
At times things are fine and then I have no idea of what is taking place.
My tempor is growing shorter, patience is very little.God Bless You & This Country of Ours!Joe

I am not sure if on my blog I ever mentiioned my son that I had long before I got married and he and his mother disappeared.
I found them two or so years ago I think, well me and my family have tried to bring him into the other side of his world, today he made it clear that was not going to happen.
So my heart is heavy and sad, but I lost him once not by my choice, now by his.
I truly hope this fuckin disease takes a greater hold soon.
Sounds selfish butt I want to mobve faster and get rid of the memmories and pain.
Sometimes it is too much trying to live between these two worlds, I feel trapped and torn, not knowing exactly where I am or why I am.
Good days and bad ones, where is the balance not with me that is for sure.I used to take Aricept and Namenda and both did nothing for me.
They are hopefully supposedly to aid in slowing down the memory loss, right.
Even the manufacturers do not know if they will work for sure, some good stuff.
I have heard from folks who have taken these drugs and their stories range from miraculous results (i thik they were on something else) to folks that got violently ill from themm and everything in between.
Me nothing just a waiste on money, so much for today,hope to meet you on the other side.I still have demented humor, and love it.God Bless You and This Country of Ours!Joe

I received this for a friend in Britian that suffers the pains of this disease of ours, if you read and follow the the link, you will see that we still can feel and cry for others and not just ourselves.
Subject: : remembering  Suzette     May 1965 - July 2006----- Original Message -----From:006This is very touching, especially for those of us who have lost someone specialbut for all of us and how we live our lives.
Hope you enjoy.
You may need atissue.
It takes about 3 mins.
ML   The Dash       In July 2006, shortly after Suzette left us, a  3-minute movie was launchedon the Internet called The Dash.
Since then, over 40 million people fromaround the world have watched it; and over 20,000 a day continue to watch it asa result of people passing it along.
;  The movie has been more successful than we could have ever imagined.
Moreimportantly, however, it has inspired many, many people to reflect on theirlives and ask THE  all important question, 'Are my priorities where they shouldbe?'
I hope you enjoy this movie and share it with those who are close to you.

I do not know who did this sketch but it stirs my insides greatly.This day or at least my brain and emotions ar on the rampage.
Everything in pissing me off even this blog.
Nobody has don anthing to me, I just am not in any type of control of myself this day.I kind of remember reding that these things would become paart of my life, and they suck.
I was vacuuming the rugs downstatirs this morning and attacking them as if they were my enemies, my mind is filled with mud I think, no control .
Good thing I am alone right now I think I would hit someone if the said the wrong thing, maybe this post will help who knows.
All I know is I want to go home and be in green pastures with my Lords' creatures to romp and play.
My mind, heart and soul are heavy this day and they should not be.
I nolonger take Aricept or Namenda at doctors orders, because they did nothing for me and people I talk to with this disease seem to vary from them miraculously being sharp as ever to having such reaactions they almost died, great shit isn't it.
Maybe it will or won't help and it just might kill you, great choice.
I am even angry at my family, wife and all, and they have done nothing.
I don't feel that they really understand the hell in my head and insides, I try to control it but of late the amountt of time I can seeems to be growing shorter maybe some so9da will help.God Bless You and This Country of Ours!Joe

Those are my five pride and joys, my grandchildren.
Number six is on the way.
Wanted to share them with you.
They are Lillian, Chase, Emma, Kobe and Malek.Ayou know from time to time I share comments and emails I get with you.
That is part of what this blog is about.
My telling of my World and your response from within it or the otherside.
Such is the following comment I received:"You are very brave Joe.
As a volunteer at the Alzheimer's Services of the East Bay day care center in Berkeley I have made many wonderful friends.
I will always remember the lady of few words who, one day, as we were holding hands, said "I am free now"I wonder if, I think so, this caretaker realizes the blessing God bestowed that day on the two of them.
First The lady realized that the journey into darkness, frustration, aggrevation, not knowing and the fog finally for her was over and a new lite was in her life.
Second he got to be there for the granting of Gods' blessing to this lady.
To say I am nott jealous of them would be an outright lie.
MY wife has gotten to witness things since she was off work for six weeks, with me.I think she and others of you outhere can understand how this lady finally felt and the day I look forward to.
Till theen I will stumble along talk to you and respond when I remember to.
Brave my friend I do not think so, scared and bewilder yes.
I just feel others need to here this side of the story direct.
It is different for each of us that is why it is so difficult to pin point.
Thier are some things I still can do and others that baffle the crap out of me.
I do not walk well, I hear different words in conversations, I don't even know when I am being talked to at times.
I built a small paver patio out front, of course my hands and fingers hurt because they were to stupid to get out of the way of the mallet I was using to tapp the brikcs down with into place.
My darling wife has informed med that more and more of my comments in public are not in good taste and I do not use my quiet voice when saying them.
Well that is just the way it is for now, exciting times to come.God Bless You and This Country of Ours!Joe

Yes i took that from an old song, but that is what my life has become, just time trapped in a bottle.
It has taken me several days to get to this, just keep forgetting and doing who knows what.
My wife was home for 6 weeks had an operation, at our age it is called a procedure, shee had to manny kids never could say no.
Had to fix stuff up.
She finallly got to see ME as i really am now, not just late evenings or on weekends, but the whole day of confusssion that I go through.
I accutually do get some things done, what you say?
good question.
I find even old memmmories are getting mixed up in their time span and order, forget the last couple of years.
This life really fuckin sucks at times, but at least I still am breathing and can have solme assembalance of converstation with folks.
I loose more and more of each day, I fall a lot easier, just fall get up and fall again, nothing to it.Climbing stairs is getting nearly like mountain climbing, as if I would know, never climbed mountains.
MY daughter and her family came down on a surprise visit for mothhers day, I love my family to death, but tolerating them all here with the kids and the noise level is geting very difficult for me, I feel like I am on the freeway with all the cars honking, the pain in my brain, a little poetry, I still have it, becomes overwhelming and my so called social skills go out the window fast.
I go hide in the bedroom or just go to sleep to escape.
I can only imagine how they must feel with this behavior, I know it bothers the crap out of me.I am true royalty, as you know that we are all blue bloods, are blood is blue until it hits the air, well I have a lot of blue in my brain (dead stuff) so remember when you read this blog you are in the presence of TRUE ROYALTYGOD BLESS YOU AND GOD BLESS OUR COUNTY!

This morning has beeeen one of those moments as I call them when old things pop up that create heart ache.
I was recalling when my frien Jimmie, friends since we wer 5 and lived accross the street from each other, at the age of 16 was found hung one afternoon, the loss is still with me and I cry for him and cannot wait until this fricken disease erases that memory, for he was one of two of my close friends that died that way at the same age.
I talked to an old school mate this morning informing him I would not be at our class reunion from Austin High in Chicago from 1962, good thing the invitation is in front of me.
We spoke briefly and asked him to say high and wish them all Gods' blessings for me.
My social graces then were not very good and now I go off in a momemnt and and would be3  more of a disruption then a pleasantness to the festivities.
This is my link to all of you that visit me, in My World that is occupied with outhers in the same sinking ship.
I do my best to enjoy what I have, but I am noticing that I am increasingly forgetting yesterday and last year and some years before more often.
I get lost in conversations, God only knows where I go because I sure the f&*k don't.
Enough of the pitty potty, I am still here and able to speak to you.
I truly enjoy hearing from YOU out there, so for now take care of yourselves.God Bless You and This Country of Ours!Joe

Some of you are aware that I am forard about my dealing with dementia.
But many I hear from, caregivers, talk about the charges are in denial and non acceptance of what is.
To this I say BS, I know you are true and giving people and really feal that way.
But I have talked with over 1500 people that live in this World of MIne and they all knew from the start and still do.
What follows is a typical e-mail I receive, filled with love, compassion and not knowing how to really help.
I have left off the peoples names for their own privacy.
After you read the email I hop to explain why i feel that DENIAL is not a real part of dementia.
"Hi Joe and Lynn.
Unfortunately I don't think that Mom is ready to BELEIVE that she has Alzheimer's.
She is the daughter of a German farming family and is very stoic.
She has never been known to share her emotions openly, and now the disease has exaberated the issue.
Don't get me wrong, she is very sweet, we are so lucky that way.
My sister and I both beleive that she sees herself quite differently than we do.
She is 84 and was one of the "June Cleaver" type wives.
We remember the frequency of the phrase "what will the neighbors think?"
She retreats to what we call "the bubble" on a daily basis.
The length of these visits to the unknown vary day depending on  the good days/bad day thing.
It is on these bad days that Mom will hardly speak at all.
She goes far away and has a distant look in her eye.
We occasionally have opportunity to gently remind Mom that she has "Alzheimer's".
She says she knows.
She has a very poor short term memory, and we see shades of the future now because there are times when my sister and I feel that Mom does not know who we are.
We have a loose diagnosis of AD, but Mom has other stuff going on too.
But, dementia is dementia.
She has big-time vascular issues, and an aortic aneurysm growing in a spot that is inoperable due to its proximity to a previous stent.
She has trouble breathing after just a short walk, and some vertebral fracturing too.
The diagnosis of AD helps us clarify to agencies the urgency for financial aide and assistance.
We just now after nearly a year have received the "Aid and Attendance" benefit from the Veteran's Administration.
The money will help us to pay our hired caregivers and not have to worry as much about spending money that we don't have.
We have been spending some money taken from a reverse mortgage and we're almost out after property taxes and a few other medical things, a tooth extraction, and a rebuilt crown, and then new eye glasses.
She had macular degeneration and cataracts too.
Mom will still do embroidery work, and she loves looking outside from her lift chair at her garden...and the bird feeders and bird bath...going full swing now.She really enjoys going outside on the sneak, if you will to water the yard.
I don't know why but it seems as soon as we leave for an errand or whatnot, Mom will have been outside watering.
Bully for her I say.Still has some spunk when it comes to her flowers...!
Well Joe, I think thats enough for now...gotta go and take core of some stuff...
Thank you again,"First I say encourage here flower watering and watching.
She is still in there and finds this is what she can do.
Try to imagine if you can knowing that each day a little more of YOU slips away, a tiny amount of what you could due goes away.
Then the process speeds up.
HOW WOULD YOU FEEL?
I think pretty damned pissed off and would try to hide things, not because of denial, but your own sorrow at the lost, regretting what you did to cause this (which is most likely nothing) and there is some shame with it.
You are no longer the person you were, but try to be, I see that in many I talk with.
I am mentally and cognitively less then I was a year aga, I even here different words in the conversations I have.
I even lose who I am talking to and come back later in the conversation.
I have maybe 7 years left, believe me like those that walk with me, I plan on fighting toooth and nail till it comes time to leave.
Many mistake the sense of loss that we have for Denial, it isn't we weep for ourselves, because we know better than you what is happening, I may sound quite with it, trust me it is difficult to write this without crying and focusing on what I say.
The email above fills my heart with gratitude that these folks are keeping the family together and working through it, They are Heros to me, because we are a handfull.
Sixtuplets don't compare to us as time goes on.
We will wear you down, but we still love in our hearts and souls.
Remember we still have our own brand of pride in ourselves.
When I started this blog I made a promise to me to tell it as it is in me and as I see it, no matter the pain caussed me or the people I piss off.If you see our side and there are others like myself who have websites and journals maybe not as cantancerus as me and myore polite and gentle, but I find not a fricken thing gentle, fun, loving, polite in this disease at all.Thanks for your ear and being out their for me.God Bless You and This Country of Ours!Joe

Some of you may have read in other entries of mine of that line that those thaat live is this World of Mine cross.
Itt is that point where you cease to be who and what you are and become another entity, if you do not physicallly pass on.
Yes they say this is gradual and can take many years, true but sure, it can happen in a day.
Here today gone tomorrow.
I have over the years since joining this ever growing community of those with dementia have seen it take place just that way.
One instance my wife told me of a fellow at one of the sites she works at who has been reading my blog and hopefully gainnned some insight and comfort that he was faultless.
HIs mother was fine the one day and the very next (24 hours later), knew crap, nota and required suddenly 24 hour care.
So many I have communicated with that suffer have had this take place with them, because I speak (this form) with their loved ones and caregiverss and they tell me of this suddeness.
What say you perverers of great wisdom and knowledge, what is that "Duh".
MY own life is growing shadowier, forgetting we said grace at dinner, turning on this beast, conversations in the middle of them, physically becoming a poster child for damage of the year or how to screw up your body in one simple lesson.
My time is coming when ??????
but it is on its' way.
I have told my family the day will come as long as I have any ability to think as who I am, that I will kiss them all and say goodbye and be gone.
I believe I have the right to passon with some of me in tact and with some dignity.
I refuse to have my family see me lying with my face in my food, as I have seen from working in Assisted living homes when doing computers.
Looking into the trap souls of those folks through their eyes made my decision along time ago shoulod I ever be blessed with this disease.
There is no cure and most likely will not be one, until they whoever they are talk to US and really learn.
For their knowledge of the brain fits in the head of a pin.
Bye for now until next time be good to yourselves.God Bless You and This Country!Joe

Do you suffer from myopia (near-sightedness), hyperopia (long-sightedness), presbyopia, astigmatism, computer vision syndrome or cataracts?
Well now that is quite a question isn't it?
I am using spell checker (as you know it is something I do not do).
I was approached by a site http://www.pinhole-glasess-direct.com/ to view their site and give my opinion of the site and I would presume the product.
They think I have a unique writting style, poor souls.
Well what follows is my view only and not an endorsement of the product, remember that.Pinhole-glasses are glasses that have laser (precised) cut holes in them on what appears to be a non clear plastic.
Could be wrong there.
You need to know that these glasses are for stationary use only.
Bull riding, cow punching, climbing Mt.
Everest or driving the Indy 500 are out.
They are made for those folks who suffer from the question I started with, which is directly from their web site.
The site makes a valiant attempt at describing the conditions and how their product works.
It is pretty simple and straight forward.
Even I understood most of it, of course it took me a number of hours reading it to get through it.
But that was so I could write this and be fair to them.
On awhole I think the product sounds good and probably, if the claims are accurate, benefit people like me who have 2000 pairs of classes because their eyes are worth not a heck of alot.
See I am far, near, close and every which way sighted.
Blind in one eye and cannot see out of the other.
So how can I type this if I cannot see, blessed with powers beyond your belief, I look at the keys while I type.The site is easy to manuever through and not trying to sell SNAKE OIL for 19.95 + if you order right now you get twice the amount, but wait I am not through, you order in the next 10 minutes we will add these special 10 scrubbing pads, breathing mask and Dr. Watchmacall its' famous toe remedy.
I would preferr the site to be more colorfull, but you see I live in a world of color, no white walls in my house buddy (they would blend in and I would walk into them).Check the site out let them know what you think.
In fact let me know.
You can leave comments right on this post (the best way) or use the email form on the side, which I never publish what is said in it.
I have not bought a pair, not sure I will, and if I should, I would tell you exactly what I think of them.
Good, bad or otherwise.Well my brain hurts and I have had a few bad days so I will say goodbye for the day and when I remember I will return.God Bless You and Our Country!Joe

As I live in this World of Mine that many others waander through with me, I come more convinced theat God has a circle of life.
One dies so that another may come into being to learn of his wonders here for us.
That circle got played out yesterday one passed on so that my fifth grandchild could join his family.
Kobe William Abdalmelek (some name), burst upon the scene voicing his opion and ready to take on all life has to offer at 9 pounds and 191/2 inches, I would say he is ready.
Even in this misty world of forget fullness, God brings gladness and joy to my life.
I wish to share that with you all.

I have been asked whaat did I notice in the beginning that made me think something was wrong.
On the side of my blog are places to go for the medical signs.
However no two persons are alike.
My Physciatrist and I talked ablut this he his opion, which to me makes sense, it takes so long to determine because it depends where you start.
In other words how much grey matter do you have to statr with and have deminish.
I noticed around 50, that multi tasking for me was starting to be confusing.
I was able, to handle 10 projects at a time without notes and jump from one to the other and back again and never miss a beat.
I was in the computer field (the beast of humanity).
I started to have to pause to remember and even take notes, something I did not do, I would forget my pen, my glasses, what day it was, peoples names, stand up to do sommething and sit down again because I forgot.
Eeach of these things in and of themselves is no big deal.
But once I started to connect the dots, you know that old kids game where you go from one dot to another and a pickure forms, these things were happening daily and more and more often, I still functioned and got my job done, but I knew something was happening.
Doctors or you are depressed, absent minded, forgetful, to much anxiety, all of a Sudden, no trauma had taken place.
Things progressed slowly, but I could feel that my once active mind was slowing down and not because I was growing older.
Talking to the text book guys was not helping.
Finally after several years of pushing and refusing the bs answers my physcologist started to believe as I did that some form of dementia was occuring, because of my memory losses, inability to do things in minutes that now took me hours to days to do, because I forgot how.
His dad had Alhziemers and he started and was the first to believe this was taking place with me.
My Physc was not sure but felt that some form of dementia was occuring.
My physician just plain ass was not sure, because I could still hold a conversation.
Finally one day talking to him with my wife, the lights went on in his head there was something wrong because he was finally paying attention to the trouble I was having talking with him.
We had done MRIs and EECs and Cat Scans, with no result, so he ordered a Pet Scan.
Low and behold, his words get to a neurologist I can not help you, well none of them had been able to either.
Armed with history at the PS, the new neurologist confirmed that I had Frontal Temporal Lobe Dementia along with inconsistent consistencies of Alzheimers (good one).
so here I site be inconsistent and whatever else I am.
All I know is that you need to look at the whole picture and stand firm and make your physicians or whatever explain why not and why something else and if their treatmenst do not work move on and kick down as many doors as needed until someone listens and starts to did.
NOtes help and having someone with you that has known you for a time that can see the differences and help explaim them will help.
Thankfully I have a wife that is stuborn as I am and keeps going until the truth is found.
You may not like what you find but you have the right to know.
I am not only having greater trouble with the grey matter but the physical affects are starting to settle in.
Well you all behave and God watch over you.God BlessJoe

As many of you that read my blog know how I feeel about leaving my grandchildren with found memories and not those to come.
Welll my eldest and her two kids have ben with us during moving, unfotunately my other two in WA have not been  My grandson likes to hide behiind the couch and table and rub my hair while I try to grab his hand he is 2 and it is a game.
Both him and my granddaughter help me get off the couch and want to play.
This old guy doesn't last long at though, but it is form them and the joy I do get.
My granddaughter is starting I feel to understand that somethiing is wrong with grandpa, but she isn't sure what it is.
Even with the bad days and not remembering, I am doing my best to be happy and enjoy what time I have left.
What the hell that was the Drs.
prescription.
I am happy most of the time and I think it is because I have accepted what awaits me and I know longer fear it or care when the line is crossed, my granddaughter is sitting with me while I write this old motor mouth.
WE that suffer from various forms of dementia can live and enjoy the time we have, crap why not, we are going to forget the pain and sorrow of before so go out dancing.
I weap more for those around me, because they have to watch from the otherside, see I soon forget and get lost in the conversssations and what is happening quiet often.
So my sorrow is momentary.
My wife shakes her head at me as we walk through the grocery store and I sing songs I make up so everone can hear, some are very colorful and I talk to everyone.
Till nex time:God Bless,Joe

When you reach your 40's you no loger have operations, you have a procedure.
So my prime caregive had a procedure, yesterday.
That would be my wife of 30 years, I slept little Sunday and Monday nights, Tuesday I was up I think aroun 4 AM waiting for my love to wake so we could start this day.
I spent the day at the hospital, my daughter got me home areound 7pm.
Needless to say I had a hard time tolleerating my grandchildren although they we just being kids.
I was alone, my wife was not with me and that meant a night without her by my side.
I am still up waiting to hear when she is coming home.
The procd.
went a ok.
But that is not the issue she helps keep me balanaced and keeps me calmed down.
Right now I am lost in my World wilhout her I fricken hate this crap.
When I am babbling she understands me somehow, because I sure don't.
These days do not help this wonder piece of a brain that I have nor my emotions or tolerancee.
I almost wish I would cross the line and no longer feel this way or my Lord would just take me home.
I have almost died several times in my life because I am so mentally solid, but neither he or the devil have wanted me, that makes a person feel pretty unloved and unwanted, when neitherr of them think your good enough to go live with them.
I am just babbling and have lost where I am at so to all:God BlessJoe

Ms.
Bright appparently writes a coloum called Blog Watch for the Wall Street Journal.
How and why she featured mine escapes me.
I say thank you to Beckey.
I am overwhelmed by the number of people that contacted me since yesterday.
In fact it humbles me and that takes a great deaaal to do.
Hopefully I made some new friends as I walk the road.
There are so many out there that suffer as I do and evven worse, that I write this blog so that our side gets tolkd at least ass how it affects me and those around me.
The last several weeks have been tough for me.
I think my wife is getting use to me standing in the issles in the store kind of looking at her and pointing and saying I know you, then things register.
My kids even ask me on the phone if I know who iam taking with.
Sometimes I know right away others it takes a few minutes of talking, but I still have a 1/2 brain cell left so I function.
To all of you that write me and tell me that you have gotten even a little comfort from this blog or undersstanding, my heart goes out to you with my own tears as I sit here and write, this has taken meee most of the morning til now to get this together.
Thank You.God Bless you all.Joe

The following is an email sent to me by a friend, who undersstandds my sense of humor and since I suffer from both thing in this, I find it funny.
Enjoy or don't your chouiceIn Pharmacology, all drugs have two names, a trade name and generic name.
For example, the trade name of Tylenol also has a generic name of Acetaminophen.
Aleve is also called Naproxen.
Amoxil is also called Amoxicillin and Advil is also called Ibuprofen.The FDA has been looking for a generic name for Viagra.
After careful consideration by a team ofgovernment experts, it recently announced that it has settled on the generic name of Mycoxafloppin.
Also considered were Mycoxafailin, Mydixadrupin, Mydixarizin, Dixafix, and of course, Ibepokin.Pfizer Corp announced today that Viagra will soon be available in liquid form, and will be marketed by Pepsi Cola as a power beverage suitable for use as a mixer.
It will now be possible for a man to literally pour himself a stiff one.
Obviously we can no longer call this a soft drink, and it gives new meaning to the names of "cocktails", "highballs" and just a good old-fashioned "stiff drink".
Pepsi will market the new concoction by the name of:MOUNT & DO.Thought for the day: There is more money being spent on breast implants and Viagra today than on Alzheimer's research.
This means that by 2040, there should be a large elderly population with perky boobs and huge erections and absolutely no recollection of what to do with them.Welcome to my World.God BlessJoe

"They" say whoever they maybe that thossse of us that suffer from the diffferent forms of dementia do not know that it is happening.
Surprise your are full of dog dodo.
I look at each day as things very slowly slip away and I see that cloud on the horizzon.
I have always had a thirst for knowledge and doing things (when I was not being lazy).
That once mighty river and fire that burned insside of me has slowly turned to a brook and a candle and it makes me sad.
As I get lost in conversationnns and it takes me longer sometimes to recognize those I knoww, I feel the battle ground beneath my feet shake a little harder.
I fought threw the cruelty of a bruttle father and naive mother, an addicted teen life and young adult drunk.
I finally learned to love without strings and taking only to have it yankked from my very arms.
But I had learned to finally lovve and give freely and became clean and sober in the process.
Now I enjoy when I am able to my family, even with the cancers and brain injuries that occured to my children and wife the fucked up relations they had, I still was able to move forward and win the battles.
Now my time has slowly come, I haaave great trouble in expressing myself anylonger, conversations and even this take a great deal of concentration and energy that I am left exhausted.
I stand with open arms to welcome to my world that which is coming, for I believe that peace will be with it and this confusion, frustration and physical pain will be forgotten, at least one can only hope.
Many I talk to with dementia, get angry with me when I talk of the death of me, who I am, I think it is because they know that it is true for them also.
God Bless you all and one day we shall alll meet.Joe

Well the last coupleki days have ben interestingl have been working with some very peststy people from HBO in the process of making a documentary on folks like us with dementia.
I imagine that they willl call ita show on Alszheimers, I hope the y call a documentery on dementia, since there are two many forms and they are different and people think AD is transmittable.It hwas been a strain to say the least, buth they are actually very nice folks, but we cannot let themmm no that.
It is hard to tell folks what it  is like, little easier to write it, because you cannot seem me or me se you.
I do not know what will happen with it if anything but it has been an experiencer, they could have at least left their one crew member here.
We hared some real tense moments and some very enjoyable ones.
They honored our table by having a turkey dinnner with us, which makes us feel good inside.
But they did not eat any of the fat raid we wnt on.
Theat means goodies..  WEllso mouch for now may be back soon.God Bless You and the Country of OursJoe

I have been abit taken back by those that have been reading tis blog since my last post and have beeen asked not to stop.
I have tried over this time to Welcome you to My World and that of others like me.
Expressing my own feelings and the loss of ones own self as it happens has not been easy, but necessary for mye.
You see I have used the time to put my house in order, sort of clean my side of the street which has met with both favor and well shell we say down right not giving a damn.
But that is ok.
I have tried to share my humor with you, my politics, love of this country and family with you and how I feel about loosing that daily bit by bit.
I have been working on this message since before eight this morning, erased it twice and it is not wha I earased at the moment that is gone.
I had wanted to write my life story and started it, THROUGH THE LAUGHTER HE HEARD MY TEARS!
Well I got so far and it like me are both disappearing.
I do not know when I will cross that line to where what makes me whatever I am me and that new being appears, but I leave you with my love, God's Blessings and the good fortune to live in what I think  is sthe greatest country on the face of this earth.I received an email from a friend and I hope you follow the link and read the email, maybe just maybe you might wake up.

Listen to the end of this.
It is something he said 38 years ago.

I have attempted tho keep up this blog and it has becomme increasilngly more difficuly.
I hope that I have at least showed some what My World and those like is like.
Comforted some because they could not understand.
Brought you some humor and education.
But my AD and now Frontal Lobe Dementia my brain and atttention is not there it is on vacation I think.
I sit down to post and forget and walk away and just turn off this beast.
I want to THANK ALL WHO HAVE WRITTEN ME AND MADE COMMENTS.
I only hope that you received in return what I had to give and you have my thanks.
I am marking my calendar, this blog will be deleted on the 15th of this month.
If it dosent happen you know I forgot to look at my calendar or just checked and got lost in my world.God Bless You and this Country of Ours!Joe

I thiink but don't remember if I have told you whoo should happen to read or check this blog at times that I have been diagnosed with Frontal Temporal Lobe Dementia, which works much faster than my old fried AD.
I get lost in my own yard, I forget what I am doing how to get back intool the house and stand their wondering whatever i wonder and thus far have found my way back.
I have grwon afraid to leave my own house because I am not shure that even going to the mailbox I will stop and remember to come back.
I wake up generally around 6 am ad the next thing I am really aware of it is 4 or 5 in the afternoon.
What scares me is not the not knowing, but when will that line come where I step over and don't come back.
Of death I have no fear physical death that is, the death of me scares me for I will cease to exist and do not want to be remembered that way, if I am even remembered.
Till and if I remember take care.God Bless You and This Country of Ours!Joe

The letter that follows has never been sent this is all done in spell check so that it makes some sense.
At long last I need to close what is the next to final chapter of my life.
I know the individual will never see this but it serves to finish my part and clean my side of the street.
It has been awhile since I have posted or written anything, that is because things are well taking their toll or scheckles if you will.August 24, 2007Dear Phyllis,I am not quiet sure how to start this letter or if it will even be sent to you.
See I have never broken my word or lied to you.
When we last talked, I promised you I would not bother you again and that was truly my intent.
But I cannot get over the way you talked to me, when I called as a friend nor the way you ran from me claiming you loved me so much it hurt that August night in 1978.
Should I send this, due me at least one final courtesy read it before you rip it up and throw it in the trash.Yes when I called it was done in friendship and with the hope you would tell me the truth as to why you left me standing like a piece of trash in the middle of the street.
I did not deserve that.
I did nothing but love you, stand by your side and support you in what you wanted to do.
I never lied to you nor even bothered with any other females, you were everything to me and I thought I was to you.I can only believe that one of two things had happened, age was not one and we both know that, I  do not believe you were seeing anyone else either; I think either your parents finally gave you an ultimatum regarding me or you were pregnant and going to get an abortion.
I found the second more likely, and would have stood by your side and decision and still cared and loved you, because we were together too long knowing your parents hated me and wished I would vanish into thin air.
I tried to show them I would not hurt you, nor was I going to let their dislike for me push me away from you.
Kids were something you did not want and if you remember correctly I told you we would marry when you decided and if we were to have children it would be your call.
All I really wanted were for us to be together in life forever.You see I feel my Lord gave me a gift the night you kissed me on the cheek and began our relationship.
To that point in my life I had never felt that anyone loved or cared for me.
Not even my parents, my father used to beat me till I bled and my mother always told me I should not make him so mad.
My friends were non existent, I learned to cheat, lie and steal at my parent's side and how to take and not give back.
Of being loved or loving I knew nothing at all.
Then you were put in my life and I learned to trust another person, except their caring and their love and I learned to give back without asking or expecting anything for the first time in my life.
You were a true gift from God, because of you I have been able to love, give and care for someone other than myself.
You taught me that and I am forever grateful, for that gift, which will never be taken away from me.This is my way of bringing closure to us and saying goodbye finally.
You see I never morn a loss, I always have rejoiced in having known the person, and I did not do that with you.
I have never allowed the kindness, love, caring and giving you showed me to overshadow the way you left my life as if there was some big dark secret.
You see I cannot perceive running from someone you love so much without telling them why they cannot be a part of your life any more unless something so bad in you mind existed that you thought I would do something crazy over.
I tell you this in all honesty I would never have hurt you, I would have rather died then cause you any pain, which apparently existed.So to you my Love and friend, I bid you a found farewell.
I hope the Lord continues to bless your life and bring you the happiness that you deserve.
Remember we lose loved ones, but rejoicing and celebrating their lives is the greatest compliment that we can pay them.
I rejoice in knowing you and am happy for the time you were part of my life.With Gods' Love,JoeGod Bless You All and This Country of Ours!

Had annual physical two weeeks ago, funny thing they say my lungs are ok, but two years ago x-rays said had emphazema, I questioned how that could be, I am not the brightest light bulb in the pack, but I do know that shit does not go away it works till it kills you.
So it appears after I had the doc (himself) look at the xrays and not take the radiologists word for things, the original x-rays were so bad he could not make any kind of a diagnosis, but the current ones are good.
Two years on meds that I did not need because some idiot cannot do their job right.
So to help with the old brain, we had a PET Scan and it shows that half of my frontal lobes are, well in Peru.
That means the rest will follow.
Have read some recent studies that AD is thought to start as other dementias in the frontal lobes.
WEll we are off to see one of the two best neurologists in the state on 9/4, that ought to be fun.
Can hardly wait for this diagnosis.
All I know for sure is my life is slowly disapating and I get lost in a world I do not know where and my youngest now tells me I am mixing of the sexes when I talk hes are shes and so on.
Life is still ok I am breathing, I can still do that right at least.God Bless You and this Country of Ours!Joe

The staart of another week at home with most everyone gone.
My brain must be cleuless at 62 and a half I am digging out juniper bushes and leveling the ground to build a wall.
Most I can handle is an hour or so.
Body stops and brains quits.
Not to smart theses days.
I get a PET scan sometime this week I think.
Had lungs and coratic ateries checked, called me today and said everything is ok there.
Sounds other then normal aging aches and pains, physically I am ok.  Upstaitts is a difereent story.It is peaceful and quite in the house right now and I am alone and really like it.
My brain isn't really doing anything either.
Been closing up my on line businesses, one left to go, in fight with credit chard companies and FTC over all of this but what the heck.
It helps my my mind hold on to somethinging rather then going off to whereeever it goes.
Half my doctors believe it is Alzheimers especially the one who lost his father to it, the others say maybe but you do not fit in theis fricken box.
Askw what the heck is wrong and well you might as well look a a wall for nothing comes back nor is ist said.
Well heaven doesn't want me, the devil could care less and death turns a cold shoulder, what is a guy to do.
so much for the pitty me side to day.
May your life be filled with love, happiness, health and peace.God Bless,Joe

The one thing I have tried to say to those I love and care about, my frineds, family, whoever they maybe, I no longer know for sure is not to cry for me when I am gone, both mentally and physically.
Hopefully my ashes will be spread in Gods' Country, YellowStone National Park, where I want to be.
Whether this blog remains or not only time will tell.
You can see I do not post as often, things are begining to mean less to me than they did befor.
So while I can say it and have the will to, I bid all those I have known a found farwell and hope I have left something good in your lives.
I am not going today, but I need this to get out of me before I forget and do not have the time to do so.
Some of my family will read this others won't the same as friends and so on, because they are just caught up in their own lives and mine is not that important in the Grand Scheme of things.
Only to me and my Lord.God Bless You and This Country of Ours!Joe

About a week ago, I think, I goined a group of peopp;e on the internest, to talk with otheer normal mental people.
I was never welcomed openly by the other dementia groups I joined and really got tired of their living ing the problem, of course we do not have much of a solution except meds and that crap for us.
But I know each day I loose a very small slice of who and what I once was.
I starrred out at things and donot even know where the hell I am or have been, until something or someone brings me back to this shitty reality I call life.
But this group has welccomed me with such open arms and encouragement that my heart, soul and eyes remain filled with tears.
I have even met people with the disease and have gotten comments from others who have had parents, friends and others with it, and they say my writting has given them a neweer understanding of our side and helped them to cope with the frustration and pain theyyy have unfortunately experienced.
I been call courageous, good, outstanding and ben thanked.
I am neither courag.
or outstanding, good ?, I am just trying to let people know what this hell is really like f=rom the inside, watching yourself disappear.
Yes I will die from this, complications they call it, mostly infections.
I forget to eat take meds go to the restroom to the point that this screen inf front of me gets jaundice, then I know your in trouble.
I have promised myself that before I have stepped over the edge into oblivion, unless it happens and I do not know it, but sense it at the tip of my toes, that my agony and that of my family further agony with me as a useless individual will cease.
Do not get all bent out of shape, if you were here, I am sure you would feel the same, on the side of my blog listen to the Alzheimers Prayer, Parents Wish, you will need speakers and power point for( A Parents Wish) and you just may understand.God BlessjoeJoe

A woman came out of her house and saw!
3 old m en with long white beards sitting in her front yard.
She did not recognize them.
She said "I don't think I know you, but you must be hungry.
Please come in and have something to eat.
"Is the man of the house home?
", they asked.
"No", she replied.
"He's out.
""Then we cannot come in", they replied.In the evening when her husband came home, she told him what had happened.
"Go tell them I am home and invite them in!"
The woman went out and invited the men in""We do not go into a House together," they replied.
"Why is that?"
she asked.One of the old men explained: "His name is Wealth," he said pointing to one of his friends, and said pointing to another one, "He is Success, and I am Love."
Then he added, "Now go in and discuss with your husband which one of us you want in your home.
"The woman went in and told her husband what was said.
Her husband was overjoyed.
"How nice!!
", he said.
"Since that is the case, let us invite Wealth.
Let him come and fill our home with wealth!
"His wife disagreed.
"My dear, why don't we invite Success?
"Their daughter-in-law was listening from the other corner of the house.
She jumped in with her own suggestion: "Would it not be better to invite Love?
Our home will then be filled with love!
""Let us heed our daughter-in-law's advice," said the husband to his wife.
"Go out and invite Love to be our guest.
"The woman went out and asked the 3 old men, "Which one of you is Love?
Please come in and be our guest.
"Love got up and started walking toward the house.
The other 2 also got up and followed him.
Surprised, the lady asked Wealth and Success: "I only invited Love, Why are you coming in?
"The old men replied together: "If you had invited Wealth or Success, the other two of us would've stayed out, but since you invited Love, wherever He goes, we go with him.
Wherever there is Love, there is also Wealth and Success!!!!!!"
MY WISH FOR YOU...Where there is pain, I wish you peace and mercy.Where there is self-doubting, I wish you a renewed confidence in your ability to work through it.Where there is tiredness, or exhaustion, I wish you understanding, patience, and renewed strength.Where there is fear, I wish you love, and courage.
You have two choices right now:             1.
Click this off             2.
Invite love by sharing this story with all the people you care about.
I hope you will choose #2.
I did.
A dozen angels r sent 2 u!God Bless,Joe

A DISABLED MANIFESTOWe proclaim that we are born free and equal human beings; that ourdisabilities are limitations only, and that our identity does not derivefrom being disabled.
We proclaim that we have the same value as people whoare not disabled, and we reject any scheme of labeling or classifying usthat encourages people to think of us as having diminished value.
We rejectthe idea that institutions must be created to "care" for us, and proclaimthat these institutions have been used to "manage" us in ways thatnon-disabled people are not expected to accept.
We particularly denounceinstitutions whose purpose is to punish us for being disabled, or to confineus for the convenience of others.We reject the notion that we need "experts," to tell us how to live,especially experts from the able-bodied world.
We are not diagnoses in needof a cure or cases to be closed.
We are human, with human dreams andambitions.
We deny that images of disability are appropriate metaphors forincompetence, stupidity, ugliness or weakness.
We are aware that as peoplewith disabilities, we have been considered objects of charity and we havebeen considered commodities.
We are neither.
We reject charitableenterprises that exploit our lifestyle to titillate others, and whichpropose to establish the rules by which we must live without ourparticipation.We also reject businesses that use us as "warm bodies" to provide a passivemarket for their services, again laying down rules by which we must live fortheir profit.
We recognize that the lines between charities and businessesare blurred in the disability industry, and we do not accept services fromeither if their essential function is to exploit us.
We assert our rights ofself-determination in the face of rules, eligibility criteria, regulations,customs, laws or other barriers, and we pledge not to allow any authority orinstitution to deprive us of our freedom of choice.Finally, we assert that any service we need, from specialized teaching topersonal care, can be provided to us in the community among our non-disabledpeers.
Segregated institutions are not necessary to serve us, and they havebeen the greatest source of our oppression, especially when they have beenrun by able-bodied people without our participation.
All human beings aremore alike than we are different.We recognize that when we assert this belief we will find ourselves inconflict with regressive institutions and their supporters, some of whom maybe disabled themselves.
We do not expect thousands of years of stereotypingto dissipate quickly.
We commit ourselves and those who come after us tochallenge our oppression on every level until we are allowed to be fullyhuman and assert our individuality ahead of our disability.By John R. Woodward, M.S.W.

Yes today is mine, tomorrow may not be.
This road that i now travel has exit rammps, but who knowws where they lead so I stay on it.
One may be the one I take that ends in a few steps and I am gone, not in a physical sense, but me who I am will be gone.
That is the nature of this fricken disease, you never know when that moment is going to arrive.
I belong to a 12 step program for 34 years that hass done its best to teach me to live one day at a time, that now has an entire different meaning to me today, for now it is hour to hour.
Went shopping with the Mrs. last night, got some soda, candy (i am a push over for that), paper towels and a bunch of toliet paper.
You see we keep the sanitaaation departmentt working.
Probably took all of 45 minutes, I was totally exhausted from it.
So there you have it, a day with Alzheimers you never know when you are going to disappear into the realm of whatever, not knowing anyone or anything, pretty damn scarry isn't it.

This is a question that I was always asking myself and slooowly seem not to anymore.
I does not seem to matter.
I fall and stumble more and it bothers others, but it is like I almost don't notice it or it is gone from my mind in seconds.
I sit and stare at this beast of humanity and family think I am dooing somthing, but reallly I do not have the faintist idea what is going on.
It is becoming more difficult for me tho pull my mental tissue together to focus on what I am doing or talking about.
Blankness is becoming more normal to me.
Dr. has increased meds to help, I take more vitamins.
Physically Ifeel fine, but the head and body seem to not like each other anymore, go in different directions.
Look at new reasearch and they say it is promising, but dig furher and find reasearch that says the opposite.
It seems no one is talking with those of us with AD on a daily basis to really see what happens.
There are 100s like me that have blogs and websites, that try to tell the world what we are like and the tortures that take place in our brains.
But unless you are drulling at the mouth, pissing in your closthes, not eating at all, wearing the saame clothers for months and need nearly 24 hour care, you cannot possibly have this disease and should not beaware of what is happening to you.
News People, we know.
Ask Nancy Regan about our President Ronald and listen to her and what she and him together went throug.
Some of us hang on, because of physical condition others go quickly, we don't know where our own step over the edge point is.
Try living that way and see how you feeeel.God Bless You and This Country of Ours!Joe

Dear Daughter,I can only imagine your fear and how scarred you must be.
You see, the brother you lost 5 years ago was my son and I lost him to.
I have had to learn to accept and love the new person he is because of the acccident.
But I can still remember having to teach him to wipe his ass all over again at 17, how to walk, to talk, to spelll (me of all people), you were not there the first day they sat him up in bed and he just ddroped over and drulled and I had to leave the room because I could not stand it and had to go back in and help, that is what parents do.
I lost your sister twice when she got married both times also, I was sad but was filled with hope and joy for her future, which seems to be coming together.
Your other sister, yes you guys never really had her, but neither did mom and I, she put us through hell, such as I wanted to beat her sense, but that would not have helped becauuuse she already was senseless.
I remember carring her in my arms bleeding to death because of her canceer and now she has given us two really beutiful grandchildren, your niece and nephew.
You I will be loosing soon to someone you love dearly and I will be hurt but happy for the adventure that awaits you and the wonder that can be yours.
I climb a mountain from time to time to survey as far back as I can see to the present to look for the rays of hope for each of you and I have seen them.
Maybe you need to due the same with your older sister and get awaaay from the trees so you can see the ever so small changes and the attempts she is making and open your heart.
I have learned not to morn over losses of those we love, but to cherrish the time that we have had with them.
Scarry step into my brain where the storm continually rages and I cannot find my way.
Shit I can not even hold your mother anymore and love her as I did once, becuase I forget how to.
Don't cry for me or pitty me, this is the way it is period.
Don't have to like it, but loved one we cannot change it.
The doctors are changing my meds the time I take them and the doses to try and slow things down.
Will it help, who knows?
But I do what I have to.
I have always loved you guys and will even when I no longer can remember who you are.
I have tried and probably failed miserabllly at times to be the best I could for you guys and do the best and right thing.
But I am only a person with faults and now a failing brain.
It may scar you, but try to listen to the Alzheimers Prayer on my site.
Plays best unfortunately in IE and maybe it may help.
But remember you I love and am proud of as I am all of my family.With Gods Love,Your Dad

I am sitting heree this morning trying to think of how I feel and really am not sure.
I am slowly starting to feel that neither me, my friends, loved onees ore even those who do not care one way or the other give much of a damn anymore.
The confusion creaps in a little deeper each day, the harder I try the worssse it seems to get.. Interest in things is leaving me, I am looking through different eyes then what I used to have and they don't see much light anymore, and I accept that as ok.
I guess it is what it is whatever that means.
Why I do this makes no sense in my 1/2 brain cell, then much of how I feel or thinkkk anymore does not seen to make any sense.
I keep trying to help and control myself but I know ai I am doing is slowly loosing it and probably making people not so comfortable in my presence.
All I know is that my so called friends and good part of my family no longer communicate with me.
Maybe they are afraid, well fuck welcome to the crowd.
So much for my ramblings, but this is my only outlet, words do not come out of my protective shell to others very easily at all.
Beaten to many times as a kid and left unloved to give up of me very much.
Now when I want to my wonderful brain (the pink matter) doesn't graps the concept very welll.
anymore.God BessJoe

Today is one of those daaays that my head is filled with thunder and grey clouds.
I am having a hard time conccentrating and paying atttention to what it is that I am doing.
My head is filled with pain that asprin and such will not relieve.
It is the total frustration of what is happending and I have no fricken control over it.
It makes sit and cry whrn I am alone and even others are around.
My only ansswer is that everything is ok, when it is not.
It is becoming more difficult to express my self and feelings.
All I know is that my house is in order and I await.
So each day I slowly slip off to some unknown adventure and listen to all those whoo think that they know what is best and have no idea.
There will come a time that this is nolonger holding me.God BlesJoe

What follows is a post written by a friend on a different board, I think that I have never heard this disease more eliquently stated than this and how to handle us.
The wisdom that follows is not mine, I entirely give Tracey full credit and hope she does not mind my usage of it.This has been my mission of education and very well may be my last post.
Read, learn and listen to her, she suffers from this rotten mind robbing disease herself.On 5/1/07, YoungHope  wrote:>> There are ALL kinds of books that have been written clinically and> scientifically from professionals of all walks of life about> Alzheimer's Disease.

Those of you thatt visit my blog will start to notice changes on the side as I atttempt to clean it up.
I have been tryingg al morning to get through my emails to no avail.
More immportatly I have spent time reading Bible Stories to my Granddaughter, this is an exxperience believe me, trying to explain what things are to a four year old is not exactly my mental forteee.
But these are the times she will remember and I will forget, in the not to distant future.
But that is ok, I can enjoy the moment, even though my nose runs, my voice quivers and my eyes run.
This will pass and soon won't even be a memory to me as my mind goes else where.
So much for today.
Catch Ya on the other side.God Bless You and This Country of Ours!Joe

Well here I am today, thought I would post early before I once again forget and the day is gone and so are the next couple of days.
Tried removing my self from meds again but at a slower pace this time, that did not work either.
With a 1/2 brain cell left not real brilliant anymore.
Juts dont like living this way anymore.
Tireed of all the crap goinginto my body, but it keeps me going, for what I dont know.
I have been slowlly deleting my email add book and removing myself from things on the web, no time to respondd or get no will or energy.
It is exttremely frustrating in the mind of mine and world.
Never quite sure what is oing on in it, just waiting to go home and hope it is soon.
Well enough of my rattling.God Bless You and This Country of Ours.Joe

I have not posted is ome time now.
I keep forgetting two.
One of my dearest friends recently losst her farther and I forgot to send her my sympathies.
I stop one of my meds and that was a big mistake, thoought I was dying, but apparently God nor the Devil want me at this time.
Life is geetting a little more confusing and frustrating for me, I don't even answer my emails the way I used to.
I feel like a captive in my own mind, body and home.
The need to lash out grows stonger each day and is becoming a little harder to manage day by day.
Part of this is the disease part of it is myoun defects of my character.
Do not know which is becomeing the more dominate part.
I have been alone in life, but never felt lonelly, I now do.
There is sadness in my sould and being and the tears and emotions come more easily.
It seems being loved and cared for does not matter all thaaat muc anymore, because I am solwy starting not to care for me or this life anylonger.
Well enough of my pitty party, life goes on, until.God Bless You and This Country of Ours

I started this blog for those with theis disease (A) and other forms of demeeentia.
My goal was to keep up daily, but that does not seem tooo work to wel anymore.
I have received over 1100 emails in the last , I donot no several weeks and am at a lost to get to mem all.
It took me over 3 hours to put a new facet in the kitchen yesterday, had to rest betwwen steps and went off and did other things and forgot what I was doing, but alll ened well, no leaks, what a suprise.
I find walking for any length of time with my grandddaughter and playing at the park is causing me great tiredness and loss of where I am at.
Good she knows the way home.
For some unknown reaason I have even opened an online business, like I have hte time and energy anymore.
Oh well, was never considerrred the brightest light bulb in the lamp.
Thought before the day disappears I would make this post.
Welcom to my world.God Bless,Joe

as you know I suffer for AD and very seldom use spell checker, I lack the wisdom to have made this up.
I do not know who did, but they are held close in my prayers.Lord, hold our troops in your loving hands.
Protect them as they protect us.
Bless them and their families for the selfless acts they perform for us in our time of need.
Amen.When you view this, please stop for a moment and say a prayer for our ground troops in Afghanistan, saliors on ships, and airmen in the sky, and for those in Iraq.Of all the gifts you could give a US Soldier, Sailor, Marine, Coastguardsman or Airman, prayer is the very best one.
Our  Military  Personnel Described:The average age of the U.S. military man is 19 years of age.
He is a short haired, tight-muscled kid who, under normal circumstances is considered by society as half man, half boy.
Not yet dry behind the ears, not old enough to buy a beer, but old enough to die for HIS COUNTRY.He never really cared much for work and he would rathe wax his own car than wash his father's; but he has never collected unemployment either.He is a recent High School graduate, he was probably an average student, pursued some form of sport; activites, dives a ten year old jalopy, and has a steady girlfriend that either broke up with him when he left, or swears to be waitng when he returns fro half a world away.He listens to rock and roll or hip-hop or rap or jazz or swing and 155mm holwitzers.He is 10 to 15 pounds lighter now than when hew was at home because he is working or fighting from before dawn to well after dusk.He has trouble spellin, thus letter writing is a pain for him, but he can field strip a rile  in 30 seoconds and reassemble it in less time in the dark.He can recite to you the nomenclature of a machine gun or grenade launcher and use either one effectively if he must.He digs foxholes and latrines and can apply first aid like a professional.He can march until he is told to stop or stop until he is told to march.He obeys orders instantly and without hesitation, but he is not without spirit or individual dignity.
He is self sufficient.
He has two sets of fatiques: he washes one and wears the other.
He keeps his canteens full and his feet dry.He sometimes forgets to brush his teeth, but never to clean his rifle.He can cook his own meals, mend his own clothes, and fix his own hurts.If you're thirst, he'll share his water with you; if you are hungry his food.He'll even split his ammunition with you in the midst of battle when you run low.He has learned to use his hands like weapons and weapons like they were his hands.He can save your life or take it, because that is his job.He will often do twice the work of a civillian, draw half the pay and still find ironic humor in it all.He has seen more suffering and death then he should have in his short lifetime.Hes has stood atop mountains of dead bodies, and helped to create them.
He has wept in public and private, for friends who have fallen in combat an is UNASHAMED.He feels every note of the Nathional Anthem vibrate through his body while at rigid attention, while tempering the burning desire to 'square away' those around him who haven't bothered to stand, remove their hat, or even stop talking.In an odd twist, day in and day out, far from home, he defends their right to be disrespectul.Just as did his Father, Grandfather, and Great Grandfather, he is paying the price for our freedom.
Beardless or not, he is not a boy.He is the American Fighting Man that has kept this Country Free for over 200 years.He has asked nothing in return, except our friendship and understanding.
Remember him, always, for he has earned our respect and admiration with his blood.And now we even have women over there in danger, doing their part in this tradition of going to War when our nation calls us to to so.As you go to bed tonignt, remember this shot.
A short lull, a little shade and a picture of loved ones in their helmets.SAY A PRAYER FOR THEM TONIGHT.If only I could have truly written these words.God Bless You and This Country of Ours!Joe

(From a Dear Friend - God Bless Her)Test for DementiaBelow are four (4) questions and a bonus question.
You have to answer them instantly.
You can't take your time, answer all of them immediately.
OK?Let's find out just how clever you really are....Ready?
GO!!
!First Question:You are participating in a race.
You overtake the second person.
What position are you in?Answer: If you answered that you are first, then you are absolutely wrong!
If you overtake the second person and you take his place, you are second!Try not to screw up next time.Now answer the second question, but don't take as much time as you took for the first question, OK?Second Question:IF you overtake the last person, then you are...?Answer: If you answered that you are second to last, then you are wrong again.
Tell me, how can you overtake the LAST Person?You're not very good at this, are you?Third Question:Very tricky arithmetic!
Note: This must be done in your head only.Do NOT use paper and pencil or a calculator.
Try it.Take 1000 and add 40 to it.
Now add another 1000.
Now add 30.
Add another 1000.
Now add 20.
Now add another 1000.
Now add 10.
What is the total?Did you get 5000?The correct answer is actually 4100.If you don't believe it, check it with a calculator!
Today is definitely not your day, is it?
Maybe you'll get the last question right.........Maybe.Fourth Question:Mary's father has five daughters: 1 Nana, 2.
Nene, 3.
Nini,4.
Nono.
What is the name of the fifth daughter?Did you Answer Nunu?NO!
Of course it isn't.
Her name is Mary.
Read the question again!Okay, now the bonus round:A mute person goes into a shop and wants to buy a toothbrush.
By imitating the action of brushing his teeth he successfully expresses himself to the shopkeeper and the purchase is done.
Next, a blind man comes into the shop who wants to buy a pair of sunglasses; how does HE indicate what he wants?He just has to open his mouth and ask...It's really very simple.... Like you!PASS THIS ON TO FRUSTRATE THE SMART PEOPLE IN YOUR LIFE!God Bless You and This Country of Ours!

As is set here having my grandddauhters bird on my shoulder eating what is leftt of my ears, I was going thtoouh some old emails and came accross this and thought you migh find the humor buth the real thruth in it.
Gates vs. GMFor all of us who feel only the deepest love and affection for the way computers have enhanced our lives, read on.At a recent computer expo (COMDEX), Bill Gates reportedly compared the computer industry with the auto industry and stated,"If GM had kept up with technology like the computer industry has, we would all be driving $25.00 cars that got 1,000 miles to the gallon.
"In response to Bill's comments, General Motors issued a press release stating:If GM had developed technology like Microsoft, we would all be driving cars with the following characteristics (and I just love this part):1.
For no reason whatsoever, your car would crash........Twice a day.2.
Every time they repainted the lines in the road, you would have to buy a new car.3.
Occasionally your car would die on the freeway for no reason.
You would have to pull to the side of the road, close all of the windows, shut off the car, restart it, and reopen the windows before you could continue.
For some reason you would simply accept this.4.
Occasionally, executing a maneuver such as a left turn would cause your car to shut down and refuse to restart, in which case you would have to reinstall the engine.5.
Macintosh would make a car that was powered by the sun, was reliable, five times as fast and twice as easy to drive - but would run on only five percent of the roads.6.
The oil, water temperature, and alternator warning lights would all be replaced by a single "This Car Has Performed An Illegal Operation" warning light.I love the next one!!!7.
The airbag system would ask "Are you sure?"
before deploying.8.
Occasionally, for no reason whatsoever, your car would lock you out and refuse to let you in until you simultaneously lifted the door handle, turned the key and grabbed hold of the radio antenna.9.
Every time a new car was introduced car buyers would have to learn how to drive all over again because none of the controls would operate in the same manner as the old car.10.
You'd have to press the "Start" button to turn the engine off.Please share this with your friends who love - but sometimes hate - their computer!

Today has knowt been wone of mey better days.
Have been angry and frustratied.
Some have felt that today, even my granddaughter.
Soon my optometrist will feeel it, taking over 5 week for lenses.
I have no patient left with waht if feel in incompentency or out right stupidness.
I should talk, cant even spel right or thing straing anymore.
But take your meds you will be okd BS.
These tiny slices are killing me, mly emotions, I have no controolll over anymore, no matter how hard I try.
This disease sucks big time.
The hell of it is our people in congress and the white house give a shit.
It isn't a minority issue.
WElll soon it will be a vast majority issue as they and theirs begein to suffer the ravages.
As nasty as this sounds, I can hardly wait for them to join me.
When it is to late to do anything, and alll they can do is say "If only I had listened".

Well we are back from Washingto and things are getting to normal.
Still forgetting who the heck I am talking to and not able to remembeer conversations.
But life goes on each day a little less than the last one, but I can still commmmmunicate to some degree with others.
Seem to P$#@ off alot of people more than usual.
But that is their problem.
They do not know what the corrrridors of my mind are like.
I really cannot explain it to them.
I know it is hard for them, but it sure is not easy on this side of the fence.
Thre grass is not green it is getting brown.
I have becomee somewhat disencahanted with those taughting how wonderful they are with this disease.
And they can write books and their blogs are art this point or another.
I sometimes think the have there heads ups their ass.
I had to have mine surgicallly removed, to see the light of day.
They write so eloquantly and do not show others how this disease and other forms of dementia really are.
It is know wonder peopel and practioners just do not get it.
I am real, I profess no secret knowledge of this disease, all I know is i suffer its relentless ravages.
Imagine sitting accross from your family as they talke to you and you have no idea who the hell the are or what they are saying.
That is the reality of it.
Yes I can recall days gone by, but yesterday or this morning forget it.
Enough from me this day.God Bless You All and This Great Country of Ours!Joe

Will be glad to get to my safe place.
But am enjoying myself.
Still cannt talk right or get thinks to come out the way I want them, but what the heck.

Yesterday I received an Email from an individual who will remain anonymous, since they sent it through the email form on the side of my page.
I responded to this individual, but I think her statement needs to be shown and addressed publicly.
I truly thank this person for contacting me.
Content of message:Message = why does everyone try to make it sound so loving and cozy.It is a horrible horrible disease.
I'm here to help but not afamilymember and not a professional.Is there a way to do this perfectly?
NO!
The stress is unbearable some days, called disgusting names by a woman who doesn't even know i feed her every single day.
There is nothing loving or sweet about this situation.
And to top it all off, having thesefeelings makes me feel like a bad person.So cut the crap about.
we're going through this with loving kindness.You must still be in stage 1.First I say to you, that you are not a BAD PERSON, you are a loving and caringindividual, who is seeing the ravages of this disease.
The person you love and care for is not capable of controlling their words, thoughts, deeds and actions.
Trust me they know you are there.
On my site isthe Alzheimer's prayer, watch it, maybe it may help you.
You see my family goes through this daily with me.
I am not in stage one, not by along shot.
I cannot even remember who they are at times when talking and looking at them.
I have days that go by that I cannot remember anything of.
My site is to tell of my life, but also to bring some humor to the world as much as I can, because it helps ME.
If you read all of my entries, you will see that I have ran stuff ofLew Body's and the Seven Stages of Alzheimer's and plan to run a series on Parkinson's for a dear friend of mind.
DEMENTIA kills plain and simple, but firstit robs you of yourself and physical functions before it lets you go.
That is not any fun from THIS side or yours.
I truly feel for you, but understand your friend issick and not responsible for their actions.
I hope you do not feel betrayed by me, but continue to contact me.
I will do the best I can to help you understand our side of this disease and maybe in doing so show you the great worth and service you are giving.
I will go back to not using spell checker, so you know who I am.
If you should write me again, you will see me as I am.
Till Then, God Bless You and This Great Country of Ours!Joe

Yesterday we who suffer from Alzheimers and other forms of dementia, lost the world most foremost aat=utority and leader in the field for fighting and working on Alzheimers, unfortunately I cannot reamber his name and the news i have looked at has not mentitoned.
Only shows how they care about us.
Hopefully they will be one of us soon and suffer the ravages that it brings and then will know.
The following link shows how much our govenment gives a damn about us.
Let them remember 2008 is coming and we are millions strong and vote.
If you think there was a change in 2006, just wait, hopefully the millions like me and the tens of millions of seniors who vote, will toss this govenment on its head and vote out eveyone possibleand showwwww them we are no longer going to take there BS.http://www.alz.org/news_and_events_5220.aspGod Bless You All and Keep This Coutry of Ours The Greatest!Joe

Because my site is jsut not for sufers of dementia, but humor and famliy values, here is something my seconded eldest daughter sent me.Mean MomsSomeday when my children are old enough to understand the logic that motivates a parent, I will tell them, as my Mean Mom told me: I loved you enough .
.
.
to ask where you were going, with whom, and what time you would be home.I loved you enough to be silent and let you discover that your new best friend was a creep.I loved you enough to stand over you for two hours while you cleaned your room, a job that should have taken 15 minutes.I loved you enough to let you see anger, disappointment, and tears in my eyes.
Children must learn that their parents aren't perfect.I loved you enough to let you assume the responsibility for your actions even when the penalties were so harsh they almost broke my heart.But most of all, I loved you enough .
.
.
to say NO when I knew you would hate me for it.Those were the most difficult battles of all.
I'm glad I won them, because in the end you won, too.And someday when your children are old enough to understand the logic that motivates parents, you will tell them.Was your Mom mean?
I know mine was.
We had the meanest mother in the whole world!
While other kids ate candy for breakfast, we had to have cereal, eggs, and toast.When others had a Pepsi and a Twinkie for lunch, we had to eat sandwiches.And you can guess our mother fixed us a dinner that was different from what other kids had, too.Mother insisted on knowing where we were at all times.
You'd think we were convicts in a prison.
She had to know who our friends were, and what we weredoing with them.
She insisted that if we said we would be gone for an hour, we would be gone for an hour or less.We were ashamed to admit it, but she had the nerve to break the Child Labor Laws by making us work.
We had to wash the dishes, make the beds, learn to cook, vacuum the floor, do laundry, empty the trash and all sorts of cruel jobs.
I think she would lieawake at night thinking of more things for us to do.
She always insisted on us telling the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.
By the time we were teenagers, she could read our minds and had eyes in the back of her head.
Then, life was really tough!Mother wouldn't let our friends just honk the horn when they drove up.
They had to come up to the door so she could meet them.
While everyone else coulddate when they were 12 or 13, we had to wait until we were 16.Because of our mother we missed out on lots of things other kids experienced.
None of us have ever been caught shoplifting, vandalizing other's property or ever arrested for any crime.
It was all her fault.Now that we have left home, we are all educated, honest adults.
We are doing our best to be mean parents just like Mom was.I think that is what's wrong with the world today.It just doesn't have enough mean moms!PASS THIS ON TO ALL THE MEAN MOTHERS YOU KNOW.
And Their Kids!!!

Have been in a days and hve been answering email comming out the old, well you know.
Life is getting a little hareder each day.
Spelling stinks, but this is how the disease affects me at least.
If you see wohm I really am, you may begain to understand how my life, what I use to know of it, slips away litlle by little each day.
I see the frustration and confusiooon and pain in my falyms eyse and how they trey ther best to bollster me up.
It is difficult to relate to someone without this damn disease what it is really lkie as it progresses.
A big word.
One time a knew a great deal of them and even new how to spel and what they meant.
I am looking forward to running a series on Parkinsons for my very dear friedn Dirty Butter, don't you just love the name, she has Parkinsons.
Also am considering getting an ebook site and try and I mean try to write my story from the start, not in a chatper way, but as a conversation between me and the person who reads it, if anyone.
Well the day is getting harder and less clear so time to go.God Bless You and This County of Ours!Joe

I find my self wandering in the house and the corrridors of mly mind wich are all messed up.
Days go bye and I do not remember them.

This information came from: www.mydr.com.au FRONTAL LOBE DEMENTIA AND PICK'S DISEASELike Alzheimer's disease, Pick's disease and frontal lobe dementias cause a progressive and irreversible decline in a person's abilities over a number of years.
Frontal lobe dementia and Pick's disease are the cause of less than 10 per cent of all dementias and may usually be distinguished from Alzheimer's disease early in the course of the illness.Arnold Pick first described Pick's disease in a 71-year-old man in 1892.
Pick's disease affects the temporal lobes of the brain in 25 per cent of cases, frontal lobes in 25 per cent and both frontal and temporal lobes in 50 per cent.
Frontal lobe dementia affects the frontal lobes initially.
Damage to the frontal lobes leads to alterations in personality and behaviour, changes in the way a person feels and expresses emotion, and loss of judgement.The following information about Pick's disease is also appropriate for other frontal lobe dementias.Common symptoms of Pick's disease     Personality and behavioural problemsThe first symptoms of Pick's disease are typically psychological and behavioural problems.
Initially, the diagnosis may be suspected to be a mental illness.
People may show symptoms of a change in their character and in their social behaviour.
They may have a diminished drive and often their expression is vacant.A person with Pick's disease may show insensitivity, which is especially noticeable in a person who previously showed consideration to others.
There may be a lack of restraint and the person may be caught up in the criminal justice system because of stealing or behaviour which lands him/her in trouble.Another sign of Pick's disease is that the person often becomes quite obsessional during the early stages, insisting that everything is absolutely neat and in order, or repeatedly washing his hands or observing little rituals each time a certain task is carried out.There may be sexual misadventures, social graces may deteriorate, the person may talk to strangers, make inappropriate comments in public and indulge in practical jokes.
Unfortunately, people with Pick's disease often suffer from significant absence of insight into the effects of their behaviour.
Language problemsLanguage problems also occur early in the disease: limited speech output, lack of speech spontaneity, stereotyping of phrases (e.g.
use of pat phrases repeatedly and excessively), perseveration (a meaningless persistence of verbal activity), a decreased vocabulary, and a considerable amount of repetition, especially of brief words and phrases.Often there is jargon and instead of being able to find the word to describe an object, the person with this disease will give a description of it instead (e.g a watch referred to as 'something you tell the time with').
This means that the person may not be able to name objects early in the disease.
Eventually the person becomes mute for periods and then completely mute by the end of the disease.
Kluver-Bucy syndromeThis refers to a group of problems which are relatively common in Pick's disease.
These are hypersexuality, gluttony, and an obsession to touch and seize any objects in the person's field of vision.
Overeating may lead to considerable weight gain.Who can get the disease?Anybody can get the disease, although there may be geographical differences in the incidence of Pick's disease.
Some studies suggest the disease to be more common in women while others suggest a greater risk in men.
The most severe cases of Pick's disease occur before the age of 60 years.
The highest incidence is between 50 and 60, but people may develop the disease earlier or up to 80 years.What is the cause?As with Alzheimer's disease, in most cases, the cause cannot yet be determined.
However, there are strong genetic components in certain families.
When there is a genetic element, it is autosomal dominant, (on average, half of the children of an affected parent will develop the disease, but half will not) but is clearly modified by a number of environmental factors as yet to be discovered.
The genetic component has been variously described as affecting 20 to 50 per cent of people with Pick's disease.DiagnosisAlthough Pick's disease can only be conclusively diagnosed after a person's death by a post mortem examination of the brain, there are several techniques, such as brain scans and EEGs, which can be used during the person's lifetime to give a probable diagnosis.
These techniques can help in determining whether the dementia is likely to be Pick's disease or a closely related disorder, for example, Alzheimer's disease.Prognosis and treatmentAs yet, there is no cure for Pick's disease and neither can the progression be slowed down with any medication treatment.
Probably because Pick's disease is much less common than Alzheimer's disease, there is less research into Pick's, and there are currently no drug trials taking place in relation to treating Pick's disease.The course of Pick's disease is an inevitable progressive deterioration.
From the onset of the disease, life expectancy is 2-15 years, with an average of 6-12 years.
Death is usually caused by infection.Some of the symptoms of the disease can be treated effectively.
For example, certain medications can reduce some of the behavioural problems.
Also knowing more about the disease and why the person is behaving as they are can in itself be an effective means of helping people to cope with the disease.
(The Alzheimer's Association NSW has an extensive dementia library, education and counselling services).What are the differences between Pick's disease and Alzheimer's disease?The main difference between Pick's disease and Alzheimer's disease is that the damage occurs in different areas of the brain, at least in the early stages.
In most cases of Pick's disease, the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain are the areas affected and with Alzheimer's disease, the temporal and parietal lobes are affected.Mendez and co-workers (1993) found, even in the absence of temporal or frontal lobe atrophy on CT brain scans, that Pick's disease can be distinguished from Alzheimer's disease if 3 of the following 5 characteristics are present early in the disease:   * presenile onset (under 65 years old);   * initial personality change;   * hyperorality (loss of normal controls, e.g.
excessive eating, indiscriminate putting things in one's mouth);   * disinhibition; and   * roaming behaviour.Compared with Alzheimer's disease, impairment of intellect and memory occur later.
As well, epilepsy is uncommon, delusions and hallucinations are rare, and apraxia (inability to perform, command, or imitate a familiar action) and agnosia (inability to recognise objects) are less common.
Gait and muscle tone are less affected.
In the late stages, Parkinsonism symptoms, immobility, incontinence and mutism occur.
In the terminal stage, the different dementias are clinically indistinguishable.CarersBeing a family carer of a person with dementia, regardless of whether it's Alzheimer's disease, Pick's disease or another type, can be physically and emotionally exhausting.
However, Pick's disease can often be even harder on families because:   * of the personality changes and behavioural quirks which are very distressing;   * often there is a delay in diagnosis of the disease;   * it receives less publicity than Alzheimer's disease and therefore, is even less understood by the public, friends, etc;   * often, persons affected with Pick's disease are younger; and   * language problems develop earlier.Families of people with Pick's disease and other frontal lobe dementias need support in their caring role.myDr, 2001.

CONGRATULATIONS TO ALL THE KIDS WHO WERE BORN IN THE1930's 40's, 50's, 60's and 70's !
!First, we survived being born to mothers who smoked and/or drank while they carried us.They took aspirin, ate blue cheese dressing, tuna from a can, and didn't get tested for diabetes.Then after that trauma, our baby cribs were covered with bright colored lead-based paints.We had no childproof lids on medicine bottles, doors or cabinets and when we rode our bikes, we had no helmets, not to mention, the risks we took hitchhiking .As children, we would ride in cars with no seat belts or air bags.Riding in the back of a pick up on a warm day was always a special treat.We drank water from the garden hose and NOT from a bottle.We shared one soft drink with four friends, from one bottle and NO ONE actually died from this.We ate cupcakes, white bread and real butter and drank soda pop with sugar in it, but we weren't overweight because......WE WERE ALWAYS OUTSIDE PLAYING!
!We would leave home in the morning and play all day, as long as we were back when the streetlights came on.No one was able to reach us all day.
And we were O.K.We would spend hours building our go-carts out of scraps and then ride down the hill, only to find out we forgot the brakes.
After running into the bushes a few times, we learned to solve the problem .We did not have Playstations, Nintendo's, X-boxes, no video games at all, no 99 channels on cable, no video tape movies, no surround sound, no cell phones, no text messaging, no personal computers, no Internet or Internet chat rooms..........WE HAD FRIENDS and we went outside and found them!We fell out of trees, got cut, broke bones and teeth and there were no lawsuits from these accidents .We played with worms and mud pies made from dirt, and the worms did not live in us forever.We were given BB guns for our 10th birthdays,made up games with sticks and tennis balls and although we were told it would happen, we did not put out very many eyes.We rode bikes or walked to a friend's house and knocked on the door or rang the bell, or just yelled for them!Little League had tryouts and not everyone made the team.
Those who didn't had to learn to deal with disappointment.
Imagine that!
!The idea of a parent bailing us out if we broke the law was unheard of.
They actually sided with the law!This generation has produced some of the best risk-takers, problem solvers and inventors ever!The past 50 years have been an explosion of innovation and new ideas.We had freedom, failure, success and responsibility, and we learnedHOW TO DEAL WITH IT ALL!And YOU are one of them!CONGRATULATIONS!You might want to share this with others who have had the luck to grow up as kids, before the lawyers and the government regulated our lives for our own good.and while you are at it, forward it to your kids so they will know how brave their parents were.Kind of makes you want to run through the house with scissors, doesn't it?

I am no longer proud enough toto try to sound intelligent when it is fading this is me now.
Hope you can us this:     Serenity Prayer    God grant me the serenity    to accept the things I cannot change;    courage to change the things I can;    and wisdom to know the difference.
Living one day at a time;    Enjoying one moment at a time;    Accepting hardships as the    pathway to peace;    Taking, as He did, this sinful world    as it is, not as I would have it;    Trusting that He will make all things    right if I surrender to His Will;    That I may be reasonably happy in    this life and supremely happy with Him    Forever in the next.

I know my last positing was rather harsh.
But it is how I feel.
I know others care and have a hard time with this damn Disease.
But they need to know, how much hell it is for me inside.
To look ant their faces and not know who they are and not know what I am doing.
They need to know a word a smile from them means more to me then anything else in this world.
Got somle new meds and they knocked me on my, well you get the picture and I had no idea where I was nothing new, little humor there.
I have joined a number of advocay groups for those who suffer, but more importantly to help those who are to follow soon after me.
Maybe they will not have to go through this, I thought living as an alcoholic 331/2 years ago was bad, but this beats it hands down, because I have no defense or tools to use to fight it.
Just the support of family friends and professionals, who really do not know what to do.
I do feel sorry for them.
But their words of encoouragement are needed.
No spell check anymore the real me will be here from now on.
Once a brillliannt person now being humbled.God Bless You and This Great Countyr of Ours!Joe

Today is filled with happiness and sadness.
This morning our newest Grandchild burst upon the scene MS. Lillian Patterson standing 21" Tall and weighing 8lbs 2oz, brown with some blond full head of hair.
The joy is because she is here.
The sadness is that I was unable to be in Port Angeles, WA to greet her.
You see I missed the birth of my first son, was at my mothers' funeral sitting and my son was born that night.
I knew I belong with him at his birth today, my priorities were wrong.
So since then I have been in the labor and delivery for my next four children and my first three grandchildren.
You see family comes first and foremost with me, that is mine, other relatives, friends and siblings may not like that, but they have to deal with it not me.
Strong statement I know but with this disease my family is even more importantto me, while I still remember at times who they are.
So share in my happiness this day, because at 12 Am and some seconds 1/05/2007 Lillian let the world know that God placed her upon his earth to be loved.God Bless You and This Great Country of Ours!Joe

I wanted to start the New Year off with a little levity, whatfollows is a message I got from a dear friend, how true and enjoy.
Ourdisease needs humor in it.
Subject: Seniors, you can't replace experience with anything.A 98 year old woman wrote this to her bank.
The bank manager thought itamusing enough to have it published in the New York Times.
Dear Sir:    I am writing to thank you for bouncing my check with which I endeavored to pay my plumber last month.By my calculations, three 'nanoseconds' must have elapsed between hispresenting the check and the arrival in my account of the funds neededto honor it.
I refer, of course, to the automatic monthly deposit of mySocial Security check, an arrangement which, I admit, has been in placefor only eight years.
You are to be commended for seizing thatbrief window of opportunity, and also for debiting my account $30 byway of penalty for the inconvenience caused to your bank.
Mythankfulness springs from the manner in which this incident has causedme to rethink my errant financial ways.
I noticed that whereasI personally attend to your telephone calls and letters, but when I tryto contact you, I am confronted by the impersonal, overcharging,pre-recorded, faceless entity which your bank has become.
From now on, I, like you, choose only to deal with a flesh-and-bloodperson.
My mortgage and loan payments will therefore and hereafter nolonger be automatic, but will arrive at your bank by check, addressedpersonally and confidentially to an employee at your bank whom you mustnominate.
Be aware that it is an offense under the Postal Actfor any other person to open such an envelope.
Please find attached anApplication Contact Status which I require your chosen employee tocomplete.
I am sorry it runs to eight pages, but in order that I knowas much about him or her as your bank knows about me, there is noalternative.
Please note that all copies of his or her medicalhistory must be countersigned by a Notary Public, and the mandatorydetails of his/her financial situation (income, debts, assets andliabilities) must be accompanied by documented proof.
In due course, I will issue to your employee a PIN number which he/she must quote in dealings with me.I regret that it cannot be shorter than 28 digits but, again, I havemodeled it on the number of button presses required of me to access myaccount balance on your phone bank service.
As they say, imitation isthe sincerest form of flattery.
Let me level the playing field even further.
When you call me, press buttons as follows:    1-- To make an appointment to see me.
2-- To query a missing payment.
3-- To transfer the call to my living room in case I am there.
4-- To transfer the call to my bedroom in case I am sleeping.
5-- To transfer the call to my toilet in case I am attending to nature.
6-- To transfer the call to my mobile phone if I am not at home.7-- To leave a message on my computer (a password to access my computeris required.
A password will be communicated to you at a later date tothe Authorized Contact.)
8-- To return to the main menu and to listen to options 1 through 7.9-- To make a general complaint or inquiry, the contact will then beput on hold, pending the attention of my automated answering service.While this may, on occasion, involve a lengthy wait, uplifting musicwill play for the duration of the call.
Regrettably, but againfollowing your example, I must also levy an establishment fee to coverthe setting up of this new arrangement.
May I wish you a happy, if ever so slightly less prosperous, New Year.
Your Humble Client    (Remember: This was written by a 98 year old woman)    JUST GOTTA LOVE SENIORS!
God Bless You All and This Great County of Ours!

Happy New Year and Remember this is directly from: http:\www.lewybodydementia.orgWhat is LBD?
Symptoms Diagnosis GlossaryEducational Publications Events Helpline Support Groups NewsletterOther LBD Resources Articles Related Organizations Scientific Advisory CouncilDiagnosing LBDDiagnosisAn experienced clinician within the medical community should perform a diagnostic evaluation.
If one is not available, the neurology department of the nearest medical university should be able to recommend appropriate resources or may even provide an experienced diagnostic team skilled in Lewy body dementia.A thorough dementia diagnostic evaluation includes physical and neurological examinations, patient and family interviews (including a detailed lifestyle and medical history), and neuro-psychological and mental status tests.
The patient's functional ability, attention, language, visuospatial skills, memory and executive functioning are assessed.
In addition, brain imaging (CT or MRI scans), blood tests and other laboratory studies may be performed.
The evaluation will provide a clinical diagnosis.
Currently, a conclusive diagnosis of LBD can be obtained only from a postmortem autopsy for which arrangements should be made in advance.
Some research studies may offer brain autopsies as part of their protocols.
Participating in research studies is a good way to benefit others with Lewy body dementia.MedicationsMedications are one of the most controversial subjects in dealing with LBD.
A medication that doesn't work for one person may work for another person.Prescribing should only be done by a physician who is thoroughly knowledgeable about LBD.
With new medications and even "over-the-counter," the patient should be closely monitored.
At the first sign of an adverse reaction, consult with the patient's physician.
Consider joining the online caregiver support groups to see what others have observed with prescription and over-the-counter medicines.Risk FactorsAdvanced age is considered to be the greatest risk factor for Lewy body dementia, with onset typically, but not always, between the ages of 50 and 85.
Some cases have been reported much earlier.
It appears to affect slightly more men than women.
Having a family member with Lewy body dementia may increase a person's risk.
Observational studies suggest that adopting a healthy lifestyle (exercise, mental stimulation, nutrition) might delay age-associated dementias.Clinical TrialsThe recruitment of LBD patients for participation in clinical trials for studies on LBD, other dementias and Parkinsonian studies is now steadily increasing.
For those interested in participating in LBD research, consider enrolling in a medical school clinical patient program, and review ongoing clinical trials here (search on 'Lewy')The Treatment of Agitation/Psychosis in Dementia/Parkinsonism (TAP/DAP) clinical trial is currently accepting LBD participants.Prognosis and StagesNo cure or definitive treatment for Lewy body dementia has been discovered as yet.
The disease has an average duration of 5 to 7 years.
It is possible, though, for the time span to be anywhere from 2 to 20 years, depending on several factors, including the person's overall health, age and severity of symptoms.Defining the stages of disease progression for LBD is difficult.
The symptoms, medicine management and duration of LBD vary greatly from person to person.
To further complicate the stages assessment, LBD has a progressive but vacillating clinical course.
It is typical to observe a significance progression, followed by regression back to a higher functioning level.
Downward fluctuations are often caused by medications, infections or other compromises to the immune system, but may also be due to the natural course of the disease.Home | What is LBD?

Entry for December 31, 2006 - Lewy Body SymptonsPlease remember this comes from link below and visit them as well as the other links.http://www.lewybodydementia.orghttp://www.alz.orghttp://www.dansinternational.orgTomorrow Diagnosing LBDSymptoms ExplainedIn this section we'll discuss each of the symptoms, starting with the key word: dementia.
Dementia is a process whereby the person becomes progressively confused.
The earliest signs are usually memory problems, changes in their way of speaking, such as forgetting words, and personality problems.
Cognitive symptoms of dementia include poor problem solving, difficulty with learning new skills and impaired decision making.Other causes of dementia should be ruled out first, such as alcoholism, overuse of medication, thyroid or metabolic problems.
Strokes can also cause dementia.
If these reasons are ruled out then the person is said to have a degenerative dementia.
Lewy Body Dementia is second only to Alzheimer's disease as the most common form of dementia.Fluctuations in cognition will be noticeable to those who are close to the person with LBD, such as their partner.
At times the person will be alert and then suddenly have acute episodes of confusion.
These may last hours or days.
Because of these fluctuations, it is not uncommon for it to be thought that the person is "faking".
This fluctuation is not related to the well-known "sundowning" of Alzheimer's.
In other words, there is no specific time of day when confusion can be seen to occur.Hallucinations are usually, but not always, visual and often are more pronounced when the person is most confused.
They are not necessarily frightening to the person.
Other modalities of hallucinations include sound, taste, smell, and touch.Parkinsonism or Parkinson's Disease symptoms, take the form of changes in gait; the person may shuffle or walk stiffly.
There may also be frequent falls.
Body stiffness in the arms or legs, or tremors may also occur.
Parkinson's mask (blank stare, emotionless look on face), stooped posture, drooling and runny nose may be present.REM Sleep Behavior Disorder (RBD) is often noted in persons with Lewy Body Dementia.
During periods of REM sleep, the person wi

Some will show no signs of certain features, especially in the early stages of the disease.
Symptoms may fluctuate as often as moment-to-moment, hour-to-hour or day-to-day.
NOTE: Some patients meet the criteria for LBD yet score in the normal range of some cognitive assessment tools.
The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), for example, cannot be relied upon to distinguish LBD from other common syndromes.The latest clinical diagnostic criteria for LBD groups symptoms into three types:Central featureProgressive dementiaDeficits in attention and executive function are typical.
Prominent memory impairment may not be evident in the early stages.Core features:    * Fluctuating cognition with pronounced variations in attention and alertness.
* Recurrent complex visual hallucinations, typically well formed and detailed.
* Spontaneous features of parkinsonism.Suggestive features:    * REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD), which can appear years before the onset of dementia and parkinsonism.
* Severe sensitivity to neuroleptics occurs in up to 50% of LBD patients who take them.
* Low dopamine transporter uptake in the brain's basal ganglia as seen on SPECT and PET imaging scans.
(These scans are not yet available outside of research settings.
)Supportive features:    * Repeated falls and syncope (fainting).
* Transient, unexplained loss of consciousness.
* Autonomic dysfunction.
* Hallucinations of other modalities.
* Visuospatial abnormalities.
* Other psychiatric disturbances.A clinical diagnosis of LBD can be probable or possible based on different symptom combinations.A probable LBD diagnosis requires either:    * Dementia plus two or more core features, or    * Dementia plus one core feature and one or more suggestive features.A possible LBD diagnosis requires:    * Dementia plus one core feature, or    * Dementia plus one or more suggestive features.

As Promised First in a series on Lewy Body DementiaBefore I begin I would like you to visit the following site:http://www.inspiringthots.net/movie/alzheimer-prayer.phpThe following comes from Lewy Body site.
Thank goodness for cut and paste it sure helps someone like me.http://www.lewybodydementia.orgWhat is Lewy Body Dementia?FactsLewy body dementia (LBD) is a progressive brain disease and the second leading cause of degenerative dementia in the elderly.
The clinical name, "dementia with Lewy bodies" (DLB), accounts for up to 20% of all dementia cases, or 800,000 patients in the US.
Over 50% of Parkinson's disease patients develop "Parkinson's disease dementia" (PDD), which accounts for at least 750,000 patients.
(PDD is also a Lewy body dementia.
)Other names for the Lewy body dementias are:* Lewy body disease (LBD)* Diffuse lewy body disease (DLBD)* Cortical Lewy body disease (CLBD)* Lewy body Variant of Alzheimer's (LBV)(LBVA)* Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD)In the early 1900's, while researching Parkinson's disease, the scientist Friederich H. Lewy discovered abnormal protein deposits that disrupt the brain's normal functioning.
These Lewy body proteins are found in an area of the brain stem where they deplete the neurotransmitter dopamine, causing Parkinsonian symptoms.
In Lewy body dementia, these abnormal proteins are diffuse throughout other areas of the brain, including the cerebral cortex.
The brain chemical acetylcholine is depleted, causing disruption of perception, thinking, and behavior.
Lewy body dementia exists either in pure form, or in conjunction with other brain changes, including those typically seen in Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.(c) 2006 Lewy Body Dementia Association, Inc.

Before I begin I want to wish you all the Happiest of Holiday Season and a Great New Year.Stage 6:Severe Cognitive Decline(Moderately severe or mid-stage Alzheimer's disease)Memory difficulties continue to worsen, significant personality changes may emerge and affected individuals need extensive help with customary daily activities.
With this stage, individuals may:1: Lose most awareness of recent experiences and events as well as of their surroundings.2: Recollect their personal history imperfectly, although they generally recall their own name.3: Occasionally forget the name of their spouse or primary caregiver but generally can distinguish familiar from unfamiliar faces.4: Need help getting dressed properly; without supervision, may make such errors as putting pajamas over daytime clothes or shoes on wrong feet.5: Experience disruption of their normal sleep and waking cycle.6: Need help with handling details of toileting (flushing toilet, wiping and disposing of tissue properly).7: Have increasing episodes of urinary or fecal incontinence.8: Experience significant personality changes and behavioral symptoms, including suspiciousness and delusions ( for example, believing that their caregiver or spouse or family are impostors); hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that are not really there); or compulsive, repetitive behaviors such as hand-wringing or tissue shredding.9: Tender to wander and become lost.Stage 7:Very Severe Cognitive Decline(Severe or late-stage Alzheimer's Disease)This is the final stage of the disease when individuals lose the ability to respond to their environment, the ability to speak and, ultimately, the ability to control movement.1: Frequently individuals lose their capacity for recognizable speech, although words or phrases may occasionally be uttered.2: Individuals need help with eating and toileting and there is general incontinence of urine ( most health care issues are problematic).3: Individuals lose the ability to walk without assistance, then the ability to sit without support, the ability to smile, and the ability to hold their head up.
Reflexes become abnormal and muscles grow rigid.
Swallowing is impaired.Generally by this time many are put in nursing homes and the like because family's cannot deal with or want to deal with the person.
Many people with Alzheimer's die from infection, this disease kills.
One of the problems is it can take fro2-3 years to 20 years for all of this to happen.
How would you like to live like this it is estimated that over 4.5 million Americans do, I believe that number is higher because we are often diagnosed as just being depressed and cannot get through to others what is really happening to us inside.
Many times until meds won't help us at all.
Watch those you love, even people as young as 20, 30, 40 more now in the 50's not only 65 and older are being diagnosed.
There is no cure at this time.
Researchers are working, but looking at so many things, I personally wonder if they are on the right track.
As much as is known about the brain, they know more about the moon than the brain.
Right now the only confirmation is opening the BRAIN after death.So be patient with us and try to understand, I hope these blogs and articles have brought you some in site into our world, remember we once lived in yours.watch this:    http://parentswish.com/site01/big.htmlGod Bless You and  This Great Country of Ours

But First my horoscope for the day how fitting:You feel like Alice, tumbling down the rabbit hole.
Unlike her, you land in your own wonderland that makes perfect sense.
After all, isn't your reality what you wished and hoped for so long ago?Stage 4:Moderate cognitive decline (what really does moderate mean to you?
)(Mild or early-stage Alzheimer's disease)At this stage, a CAREFUL MEDICAL REVIEW (Doc pay attention please) detects clear-cut deficiencies in the following areas:1: Decreased knowledge of recent occasions or current events.2: Impaired ability to perform challenging mental arithmetic-for example, to count backward from 100 by 7s (I know eight year old who can do this, so I guess I can I am eight)3: Decreased capacity to perform complex tasks, such as marketing, planning dinner for guests or paying bills and managing finances.
( I screw up the check book, did computers for a living and now have trouble doing email, although allot of people will say no he doesn't.
)4: Reduced memory of personal history.5: The affected individual may seem subdued and withdrawn, especially in socially or mentally challenging situations.
(too many people over two cause me confusion)  ( had to stop and spell check I sound smarter)Stage 5:Moderately severe cognitive decline(Moderate or mild-stage Alzheimer's disease)Major gaps in memory and deficits in cognitive function emerge.
Some assistance with day-to-day activities becomes essential.
At this stage, individuals may:1: Be unable during a medical interview to recall such import details as their current address, their telephone number or the name of the college or high school from which they graduated.2: Become confused about where they are or about the date, Day of the week, or season.
( I do that all the time now, good thing for calenders and my family to keep me on course).3: Have trouble with less challenging mental arithmetic: for example counting backward fro 40 by 4s or from 20 by 2s.4: Need help choosing proper clothing for the season or occasion.
( my work around wear the same thing, until told different.
)5: Usually retain substantial knowledge about themselves and know their own name and the names of their spouse or children.
( I guess that is why I have to point to their rooms so my wife knows who I am talking about or play 20 questions, but we get there.
)6: Usually require no assistance with eating or using the toilet.
(Yeah I can still do that all by myself, I am a big boy now).Well tomorrow six and seven.
Till then:God Bless You and this Great Country of  OursJoe

Today I am going to start to help you understand the disease simply as possible and will start with the first through third stages and continue next time with 4 and so on.
Remember this is not my list, but I agree I got from others.First Stage:No cognitive impairment*Unimpaired individuals experience no memory problems and none are evident to a health care professional during a medical interview.Second Stage:Very mild cognitive decline*Individuals at this stage feel as if they have memory lapses,especially in forgetting familiar words or names or the location of keys, eyeglasses or other everyday objects.
But these problems are not evident during a medical examination or apparent to Friends, family's (at times) or coworkers.Third Stage:Mild cognitive decline (Early stage Alzheimer's can be diagnosed in some, but not all, individuals with these symptoms)*Friends, family or co-workers begin to notice deficiencies.
Problems with memory or concentration may be measurable in clinical testing or discernible during a detailed medical interview.
Common difficulties include:1: Word or name finding problems noticeable to family or close associates.2: Decreased ability to remember names when introduced to new people.3: Performance issues in social or work settings noticeable to family, friends or co-workers.4: Reading a passage and retaining little material.5: Losing or misplacing a valuable object.6: Decline in ability to plan or organize.Great spell checker.
More to follow tomorrow.
Now maybe my world and others is starting to sink in and you know how we feel.
I can imagine how you must feel.God Bless You and This Great Country of OursJoe

Sometimes I feel like, I am lost and do not know what I am doing.
Maybe that is normal for the condition, but it sure frustrates me.
As some of you have read I am on a mission and have posted a news article at:http://www.younewz.com/article/health-news-20Maybe waisting my time, but that is all I have now.
I read others blogs and pages, some of which I have on my blog.
But I want to leave something other than just an old person with Alzheimer's that was nut to you.
I want you to know that we care and we want you to know that this affects, yes affects people in their 20's, 30's, 40's, 50's and older, it is not just an old folks disease.
Finally research and professionals are waking up to the fact and leaving their little boxes that they diagnose in and coming to grips with reality.
Thank God this has spell checker.
Well leave a comment.
At the little box on the bottom of this message.
It would be nice, say I nuts, you agree, go  away at least acknowledge I exist.God Bless You  All and this Great Country of OursJoe

Dear Mr. Vice President, I am writing to you rather than the President as I know I will ge the usually    THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUGGESTION BS AS I HAVE FROM ALL 100 SENATORS OVER THE LAST DAY.
I will include the message I sent each of them, except the President.
I intend if able to, to contact all 435  Representatives as well.
You all speak of helping to fix America, Family Values, Faith Based Programs, what about our PARENTS, GRANDPARENTS and a lesson to our Children of respect for them.
I take no credit for the link that will be in the email I am 62 with Alzheimer's so maybe you all think I am crazy.
But I CHALLENGE YOU all to put this in front of America and see how they feel.
Thank goodness for spell check so I do not sound like a complete idiot, still getting the hang of grammar checker.
I am a member of DANSI and AARP and have voted in every election State, Local and Federal since I was eighteen and proud of that right and fact.
I am a 62 year old American and a member of DANSI and I am writing individually this message to each and every Senator and hopefully all 435 Reps and the President.
To see who has the tenacity to visit the the included web site.
I suffer from Alzheimer's but that is not why I am writing I hope you and others visit the site with your speakers on and pass it on to others, maybe one person at a time will help bring back the respect among ourselves there once was.

Today I have read the seven stages of Alzheimer's and other dementia's and truly feel for the first time for those who try to diagnose and care for us.
You just plain do not know for the most part.
I have met a few who do.
Imagine a test count back from 100 by 7s, what day is it, what is the date, who is the President, draw these boxes, write a sentence.
Hells bells, I know eight year old that can do that, so I progress from 62 years to 8 years, not a thing wrong.
You do not see beyond your books, nor listen with your hearts to our tears and words.
We feel the slow loss inside of us, we are aware more then you think.
All we ask is talk to us, offer your hand and understanding when we need it, don't cast us off as we are creatures of the night.
If I offend I intend tooooooo, I want others to join in the fight and try to understand us, just as those with AIDS have tried to do, but the ignorance of those out there is sometimes overwhelming.
Great for spell check  although sometimes words are mispelled for a reason.I was going to stop this blog, but not now, maybe one person will read and respond and start to understand and help pick up the torch.God Bless You and This Great Country of Ours

Last night this disease taught me how it works on you.
You think you have it all together and oops up pops the Devil.
The wife asked me about several things from the week, that I had completely forgotten about doing that I did as I had been asked to do and about phone calls.
This really gets to be worrisome.
Still have to check my email today.
Since I joined DANSI, the box is to full, takes forever to answer and read.Bye for now.God Bless You and This Great Country of OursJoe

I joined the DASN society yesterday and was greeted with such an overwhelming response that I am still responding to emails.
Getting to slow.
I am posting a new link today, that I think that if you are a child, parent, grandparent or just a person it will touch you.
It was provided by a DASN user YoungHope.
http://parentswish.com/site01/big.html Check it out it is awesome.
It will be a permanent link on my blog until it is removed from the Internet which I hope is never.
Today so far I feel rather connected, it is a good day, which I intend to enjoy while it lasts.
Not all days are bad, but some a quite different.
Searching and not knowing what you are searching for, or why you are searching.
Thank God for my family and friends and newly found ones.
It is nice not being alone.

Today has been a good day for me thus far.
A far cry from the last couple of days filled with, frustration, confussion, anger and just not knowing what I was doing.
But I guess that is to be expected with the damn disease.
It is quiet in the house right now and that is wonderful, no noise, nothing , just peace and quiet.
Truly wish I would hear from more of you out there without having to go to chat rooms, they type to fast at times for me, but what a great bunch of people.
Well bye for now.God Bless You and This Great Country of Ours!Joe

The test indicated Alzheimer's in nineof the 10 patients suspected of having the disease,and incorrectly fingered three people.Dr.
Norman Relkin, lead researcher in theproject, has begun talks about testing his results,and preparing for larger studies to see if this is apotential "biomarker" of Alzheimer's.Go to full story: lycos.com (http://rs6.net/tn.jsp?t=yrmhx9bab.0.o4bfy9bab.oyfjcabab.10043&ts=S0218&p;=http%3A%2F%2Fnews.lycos.com%2Fdynamic%2Fstories%2FA%2FALZHEIMERS_SPINAL_FLUID%3FSITE%3DLYCOS%26SECTION%3DHEALTH%26TEMPLATE%3DDEFAULT%26CTIME%3D2006-12-12-07-04-36)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Pharmaceuticals Companies Enter Drug Alliance(Source: Business Wire) - GlaxoSmithKline and EPIXPharmaceuticals announced a strategic collaborationto discover, develop and market novel medicines forthe treatment of a number of diseases, includingAlzheimer's.EPIX will be responsible for the discovery anddevelopment of PRX-03140 for the treatment ofAlzheimer's disease.Go to full story: businesswire.com (http://rs6.net/tn.jsp?t=yrmhx9bab.0.p4bfy9bab.oyfjcabab.10043&ts=S0218&p;=http%3A%2F%2Fhome.businesswire.com%2Fportal%2Fsite%2Fgoogle%2Findex.jsp%3FndmViewId%3Dnews_view%26newsId%3D20061212005330%26newsLang%3Den)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Early Diagnosis of Alzheimer's on the Rise(Source: MSNBC) - James Smith remembers the shock ofhearing his diagnosis.

The Alzheimer's Association says as manyas 650,000 Americans under age 65 have beendiagnosed with the disease.
Experts say theincidence of Alzheimer's is not increasing inyounger people.
Rather, doctors are better atdiagnosing it and there is less of a stigma attachedto the disease.
"Once I get to the point to where I've lostawareness and I can't recognize Juanita, I don'tknow who my children are, to me, that's a scaryworld because I don't know what that feels like," hesays.Researchers hope by studying young people withthe disease they will find far better treatments.Go to full story: msnbc.com (http://rs6.net/tn.jsp?t=yrmhx9bab.0.q4bfy9bab.oyfjcabab.10043&ts=S0218&p;=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.msnbc.msn.com%2Fid%2F16158987%2F)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~More"Creative and Responsible' Senior Care(Source: LA Jewish Home for the Aging) - "Theconfluence of people living longer plus more peopleentering the senior age group sadly means that therewill be a growing number of people afflicted withAlzheimer's disease," said Molly Forrest, presidentand chief executive officer at the Los AngelesJewish Home for the Aging.

Just out of mycurrent set of beliefs about myself.
I thought Icould do this, it turns out I can't.
I thought Icould figure that out, it turns out I can't.
I don'tknow if I've moved on, or over, or up, or down; butI know for sure I'm not the same person thisafternoon that I thought I was when I woke up thismorning.We are in the midst of a major re-do of ourhouse.
It started out with Granite Counter tops (Iknow, don't ask me either why we need them, we justdo).
It has grown into wood floors, new drapes, acomplete house-wide paint job (Taupe for those ofyou who just had to know), new granite back splashfor the kitchen, new plumbing, new this and newthat.
Everything will be new, except me!I still am living with dementia, probably of theAlzheimer's type.Well, who is going to install the under cabinetlighting?
Not me.What about steaming the old wallpaper off in thedining room?
Not me.
Surely, someone will ask me topaint.
No one else in the family likes to do it,except me.
No one has asked!
How about pulling upthe rug, rolling it up and throwing it out?
Youguessed it, not me.Thus far, my job seems to be opening and closingthe front door for the soon-to-be hired workers whoare giving estimates to do MY work!This situation called for a family meeting.
"Did you all forget I have, can and even like towork on home projects?
Did you forget all the moneyI have saved us by figuring things out by trial anderror, and if and when that doesn't work, consultingthe directions for a number of highly complicatedin-home projects?"
I proudly asked.Silence from all others; stares at the table andout of the corners of their eyes at each other.
Icouldn't tell if they were mad or sad.
I did knowthere was a common feeling holding back all theirtongues from speaking.
Then it hit me: "I haveAlzheimer's disease!
They don't trust me.
They don'twant me to do the work.
Either they believe I can'tdo what needs to be done, or I will try and mess itup.Wow!
"I confronted them directly and they offeredhalf-assed excuses as to why I shouldn't do this orthat.
"Remember (15 years ago!)
when you tried tofix the ceiling fans and when you turned them onthey blew every fuse in the house?"
"We thought youwere too busy with your other projects and didn'twant to take up your time" "How did we know you wereinterested when you didn't speak up?"
And so thedebate began.
I won ALL the arguments, yet here Istand at the door waiting for the "floater" to walkin.I suspect this experience is not unique to peoplewho have a cognitive disease.
Many families don'ttrust each other when it comes to doing thingsaround the house because we are allegedly "sloppy,don't clean up after ourselves, do a half assedjob," and so on.
What turns this situation into amajor downer for yours truly is the fact that Ithought part of who I was, was being able to dothese things.
I thought other people loved andrespected me because I could do all things, had doneall these things, mostly successfully.Now the two key questions for me are: Do theystill love me?
and Why?
Despite my claims to the contrary, I do definemyself more or less by what I can do, not who I am.I'm no longer sure of who I am.
I'm sometimesagitated, aggravating, insensitive (more that in thepast), frustrated (much more than in the past),insecure (a great deal more than in the past), andsimply unaware of what other people tell me.
I havelost the definition of myself that I spent sixtyplus years putting together.
I don't trust my ownself anymore!How many more times will I put my family throughthis personal rediscovery of the changes in myabilities to meet life's every day challenges?
Theother day I couldn't find the place to put gas in mylawn mower.
I searched for more than half an hourbefore I asked a neighbor to come over and show me.I have started to use more and more pronouns becauseI can't recall people's names, even my owngrandchildren!
I know these things are true becauseothers have told me I do this!
I've been discovered.I've been exposed.Yet I still woke up this morning in my old self.Sometime, perhaps last night, I moved and didn'tknow it.

Yesterday was just terrible for me.
Trying to change things here, I not only lost the blog, but my profile for my browser, addresses book, bookmarks and the rest.
Slowly getting back to normal now, whatever that is, meeting new friends in other Alzheimer chat rooms.
Will be adding links to my blog for them.
Hope the day gets better, if not right now is OK. God Bless You and This Great Country of OursJoe

I just feel plain confussed and not connected today.
I guess that is how this works.
I am irritable and somewhat frustrated.
They tell me this can go on for years.
I sure hope not, this way of living with a mind that once was like a sponge, now drying up, just is not for me.
I am sure those who suffer out there with Alzheimers must feel the same way and just want it to be over with.
I am ready to move on now, I do not like this feeling.
Yes I am on a pitty party right now.
But I cannot change what is happening to me and that really ((***&&^&^%%%$ me off.
I have been a fighter all my life and am so loosing this battle and really do not like it.Well you all have a Great Holiday Season.God Bless You and This Great Country of OursJoe

I just read a new post by Don Hayden on his site and I feel very much for him as he progresses along this path we are on.
I understand his frustration and looking at who he is, but I say to him you are still there with us to talk so things are ok, we need you out here.I am also thinking about my wife today who was bidding for an item for me on ebay and lost.
I know how disappointed she will be, but I still love her for it.
I have tears in my eyes as I am writing this and I think of what she still has to go through with me and it bothers me greatly.
My family will feel the strain as well as will my friends.
I can only hope that they find the strenghth inside themselves to know that they are loved by me and I care about their concerns.
Someday this disease will be able to be fought and halted in its, tracks.
Thanks to those who are working and giving of themselves to find the way.God Bless You and This Great Country of OursJoe

Visit Don's site and read his blogs he also is on the journey with AD and has alot of good postings.
Great words of advice out Mayo Clinic.
I'm going to paraphrase from an article I read today out of the Mayo Clinic.
Dr. Eric Tangalos, an Alzheimer's specialist was interviewed.
When I tell people I have Alzheimer's but still drive and write and function normally, they tell me they didn't think AD could be diagnosed until autopsy.
Dr. Tangalos affirms my belief that diagnosis can and should be made in early stages with examinations and other test.
Despite the time and effort, there is no better investment in order to make an early diagnosis.
Brief test in your primary care doctors can screen for the need for more thorough testing.
Early signs to lead you to the doctor to start with can be summed up simply: Change in behavior!
Apply that to the following list:  MemoryDifficulty performing familiar tasksProblems with languageDisorientation to time and placePoor or decreased judgmentProblems with abstract thinkingMisplacing thingsChanges in mood or behaviorChanges in personalityLoss of initiative    There are three stages in AD; cognitive decline, functional decline and behavioral decline.
Most people are diagnosed in the second stage because they do not want to anticipate being told they have AD.
Worst yet, doctors avoid the word as well.
But that is going to change.
Early diagnosis allows the drugs now available to be most effective and gives time for the patient to prepare, socially and economically for what is to come.
Dr. Tangalos points out the value of improving the home environment, perhaps downsizing to make the space more manageable or installing inexpensive devices like motion detector lights and big-button phones.
Maintaining a routine is essential.
If you are going to move or make a major change in your environment, do it in the early stage when the patient can adjust or in the late stage their function is already extremely impaired.
Dr. Tangalos ended the interview with this: "(People are coming in for diagnosis) much too late.
That's easy to understand because Alzheimer's is such a devastating disease.
But we'd like patients and families to run toward the diagnosis, rather than away from it."
From one who is living that reality, I say Amen!

Spent the last few days with decorating the house for the holidays.
Been chatting at alz.org with other folks suffering and caring for those with Alzheimers and have enjoyed the time.
But the mind gets fuzzy after awhile and have to leave.
It is nice to have a place to go and talk with others having and knowing others that have this disease.
You do feel isolated and never know how it is going to progress, today your ok, tonight you have no idea what is going on.
Well I am still breathing.
Would like to hear from someone.God Bless You and This Great Country of OursJoe

Howdy to you all today is not a good day for me.
Been having problems forgetting what I am doing and where I am putting things.
Getting to distracted today.
Did have fun with grand daughter yesterday taking her for walks, good thing she remembered the way back, because I got confused.
She wanted to go for a ride and I said ok I will drive.
No Grandpa you cannot drive she said, you are not supposed to.
Little bugger, God has Blessed me.
Well that is all my brain can handle today.God Bless You and This Great Country of OursJoe

Last night the Wife, two daughters and my granddaughter (3yrs) started decorating the house for Christmas.
My granddaughter was so proud that she got to put ornaments on the tree and point out with great pleasure each one to me.
These are the moments I want her to remember, not the time that is coming when grandpa will not be very well shall we say with it.
I cried most of the night in silence as I felt sorry for what my family is going through.
I know my time will end of knowning anything, but they will be left with the wreckage.
I have battled alcoholism, smoking, parkinson, my homosexuality and have stayed the course in these battles, but this is one that I am slowly loosing, Alzheimer's does not care who or what you are it just keeps eating away at your mind taking its' share each day.
I know it sounds like I am very coherent, but it takes a great deal of concentration on each word and rechecking spelling.
It hurts when my wife has to call me several times to acknowledge her, because I am somewhere else, God only knows where, because I sure the hell don't.
But I am still here and still breathing.God Bless You All and This Great Country of Ours!

This was taken on a recent trip to Illinois to visit my family.
Our grandson Ian and his Mom and Dad (Alan and Jen) went with us.
Some of my family members had not met Ian yet, so it was nice that we finally made that happen.
Family vacations are rare -- we also got to visit with some long time friends.
My brother retired the day before we arrived so we had a special celebration for him.
He has gotten himself involved in some Alzheimer's research in which he has had to undergo a lot of tests.
He hasn't show any signs of Alzheimer's but they want to watch him over a period of time.
I really appreciate that he has done this and I know that in the long run all research is good for the cause.
Our Walk to End Alzheimer's is coming up in October and I have been working to get all m donations in.
I am hoping that my team can raise $20,000.
Last year we ended up with $17,000+ donated.
If you would like to donate you can click here and it will take you to our site.... Athens Walk to End Alzheimer's.
I would certainly appreciate anything you could donate.

Can you believe that I am posting within a month of my last post?
I can't.
I have tried to get on several times but the thoughts just weren't coming together.
In the past week three more people I know have been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease.
It is just everywhere.
I am glad they are getting diagnosed and the help they need, but I wish it wasn't happening so frequently.
Next month is Brain Awareness month so you will probably be seeing more things about Brain diseases in the news.
I decided to go off one of my medicines.
It was to help me with my concentration.
It was working, but it was a hassle to get and the stress of getting it was too much for me to take anymore so I decided to go off of it.
Now I find myself being more exhausted because it takes so much more of my mind to focus and concentrate.
One trade off for another I guess.
Healthline.com has added my blog to their list of "Best Alzheimer's Blog for 2018".
They sent a badge for me to insert into this blog, but I haven't been able to make it work.
I'll keep trying.
On another note, my dear friend, Lisa Genova, who wrote Still Alice, has a new book out about ALS.
The book is "With Every Note Played".
I urge you to read it -- you won't be sorry.

Imagine that -- another post and it hasn't been three or four months -- or longer!
I have had quite a few doctor's appointments this week -- mostly pertaining to my cancer.
Everything is good, just follow ups.
I am also seeing my neurologist tomorrow.
My appointments there are a little depressing because there isn't anything he can do for me other than refill my prescriptions.
So, we keep moving on -- maybe not the way we want to go but the way we are destined to go.
Other friends are dealing with life threatening diseases as well and that can be a real downer.
We all have our battles to fight -- some being harder to win than others.
One way or another we all get through it -- but family, friends and faith play a major role in that.
I am thankful for all three.

It isn't a joke -- one year ago today I had that fateful mammogram that showed my stage 2 cancer.
It has been a long year -- one I hope to not repeat.
I go this week for my six month mammogram from surgery.
We are hoping all looks good.
I have seen more doctors, labs, hospitals than I ever wanted to.
I know lots of people coping with much worse than I went through and I salute them.
Praying for everyone's recovery and better days.
On another front, the new 2018 Facts and Figures about Alzheimer's Disease is out.
You can view them here : https://www.alz.org/georgia/.
Our Walk To End Alzheimer's is in October so I will be reaching out to many to help us fight the cause.
I am getting more time to visit with my little grandson.
He is 16 months old already -- and has the best giggle in the world!

Yes, that's me now -- grey hair and all!
I've been coloring my hair for over 30 years and I told my husband that after the cancer, that however my hair came back it was going to stay that way.
So now it is grey and curly.
This photo is about a month old and it has grown longer, but this is the new me.
Take it or leave it.
My grandson Ian is now 13 months old and always brings a smile to my face.
For the love of children.
He is a pretty huggable guy but he stays "busy" as I like to say.
I am hoping that 2018 will be a healthier new year for me.
I certainly wasn't expecting the cancer diagnosis last year and I am hoping there are no surprises for me this year.
I'm heading off to New Orleans this week to an Alzheimer's Association Leadership Summit.
Hope to learn some new things and be able to post when I return.
Thanks for bearing with me last year......here is to a healthier, happier 2018!

Yes, it has been many long months since I have added anything to this blog.
The last few chemo treatments I had this summer did a number on me.
I was sailing along pretty well and then a big old truck seemed to come smashing into me.
After my chemo finally ended, I went in for surgery.
Luckily, the chemo had done its job (it should have for what I went through!)
and the tumor was pretty insignificant at the time of surgery.
A few weeks later I started radiation treatments.
On November 13th I will be finished with everything.......or that is the plan anyway.
I went for my original mammogram on April 1 (no joke) and 7 months later -- I am on the verge of finishing treatment.
Of course, follow up exams will be made and I will continue to meet with my oncologist but hopefully all the nasty stuff is behind me.
This is definitely not how I wanted my year to go.
Through all this my Alzheimer's has "flared up" with my chemo brain and my Alzheimer's brain combined I had some days where it was just easier to stay in bed -- and that I did.
But, the farther and farther away I get from my original chemo treatments the better that is.
And, we just finished our Walk To End Alzheimer's last week and our team raised over $15,000.
I am so proud of everyone and so very thankful for all of my friends and family for getting me through all my health battles this year.
I can never thank them enough.
And of course, there is this guy -- turning 11 months old.
Every time I was feeling really down or really sick I got a little dose of Ian and I started smiling.
I know that is what grandchildren are all about.

Monday, I head back to the chemo chair.
At least I know what to expect now!
But, my doctor was kind enough to delay my next treatment one week so I could visit family last week.
My husband, brother and I went to the US Open Golf tournament for one day at Erin Hills in Wisconsin.
It is an amazing course -- one I would never want to play.
We were also able to visit with some cousins that live in Wisconsin that I have not seen in about 8 or 9 years.
I needed that visit.

A few months ago I came across an old friend on Facebook and re-connected.
We had just lost track of each other and it was so nice to hear from her again.
One of the first questions she asked me was "Did your son ever open up his letters you wrote him on his birthdays".
I had forgotten that I shared that with her.
If you have followed my blog you know that I the day my son was born, I wrote him a letter.
I put it in the safety deposit box and every year after that I wrote a letter on his birthday and put it in the safety deposit box.
I think at some point he knew what I was doing but we didn't talk about it.
I really enjoyed writing that letter and added photos and different things.
I would collect thoughts and stories all year and save them for that day I wanted to write "the letter".
As the years went by I wasn't sure when I wanted to give them to him......on his 18th birthday, 21st birthday, graduation.....?????
When I was diagnosed with Alzheimer's these letters took on a different meaning.
I wanted to share everything with him before I forgot everything.
Some years the letters were very hard to write.
I finally decided that the night before Alan got married I would give him the letters.
I purchased a brown leather case.
We shared time that night and it was really hard for me to give him these letters.
And, he didn't want to take them from me.
We shared a few tears and I finally convinced him that it was the right time.
I think maybe he thought I would never write him another letter, or that I had given up on life or something.
My only condition to him was that -- he could read them when he wanted but that when he did read them I wanted to know that he had.
That was almost nine years ago.
On Mother's Day this year, Alan gave me a letter.
The letter said he had read my letters the week before.
I didn't ask why now but I would suspect that my cancer scare brought him to it -- not knowing what my long term prognosis is going to be.
That was a hard day.
So, Jan......the answer to your question is "Yes, Alan has read his letters."

Last Monday, May 22nd, I have had my first chemo treatment.
In an update to my last post, the other tumors that were located in my body were benign and I was doing the "happy dance".
I told friends later that I was so relieved to "just have breast cancer", that I never thought I would hear myself even mutter those words.
So, Chemo started last Monday.
Monday wasn't too bad but the ensuing days have added lots of new side effects, lots of sensations, lots of highs and lots of lows.
But, this too will pass.
There are many many people much worse off than I am so I am thankful for everything that comes my way.
I went to purchase a wig.
Not sure how much I am going to wear it, but by this time next week, I shouldn't have any hair.
Right now it doesn't seem to bother me, but it probably will when I see it dropping to the ground in clumps.
The good thing is that I don't have another chemo appointment until June 19th.
It was suppose to be earlier but we had planned a trip to visit family in Illinois and the doctor thought it would be good for me to go, so we will delay chemo for one week during that cycle.
After getting back on track I will have chemo through the first part of August, followed by surgery and then 5-7 weeks of radiation every day.
This guy makes me smile -- he turned six months old this week.

Last week I was welcomed in Warner Robins by the NARFE state convention.
(National Active and Retired Federal Employees) -- I was one of their keynote speakers and they were great.
Thanks to all of you for having me there -- I enjoyed my time and getting to know some of your members.
This organization gives very very generously to the Alzheimer's Association not only on a state level but on a national one as well.
We are very grateful for all they do.
As I mentioned in my previous posts, I'm dealing with this breast cancer thing.
Since then, a few things have changed.
My chemotherapy treatments that were suppose to start this week didn't.
Last week I had a CT scan of my torso and a tumor was found in my liver.
In addition, a bone scan indicated there was a "suspicious" spot on my spine.
Needless to say, these are not things we were prepared to hear.
Every time I go to the doctor I find more things I didn't want to hear and certainly weren't expecting to hear.
So, tomorrow I sill have another CT scan of my abdomen and my pelvic are so they can get a better look at the liver tumor.
A few days after that (we hope) there will be a biopsy done on that tumor to see if it is malignant.
I will also have an MRI on my spine to look closer at the spot there to determine what it is.
We are in that "hurry up and wait" mode which is always pretty agonizing.
Our next doctor's appointment is next Thursday and we are hoping that by then the results of all of these tests are in and we can again get a course of treatment.
I hate to take more tests because they keep finding new things.
All of this has been weighing heavily on my mind and my focus isn't clear.
My friends and family have been there when I need them and I know they will continue to be.
Please keep us in your prayers as we continue on this journey.

Since I lasted posted I have visited an oncologist regarding the breast cancer diagnosis.
Not a fun few hours for sure, but we have a plan now and if all stays true to that I will start chemotherapy on May 10th.
One thing we are concerned about is "chemo brain" -- a side effect from the chemotherapy.
Short term memory can be hampered as well as other things such as lack of concentration and that 'foggy" feeling.
I know those things all too well now, I am hoping they don't get much worse.
But there isn't anything we can do about it so we are hoping for the best.
After 4 cycles of chemo (one week on, two weeks off - for a total of 12 weeks) then it is on to surgery.
After I recover from surgery we will be looking at radiation for 5-7 weeks (five days a week).
It is going to be a long summer.
This week I still have a few tests to take to prepare for the start of chemo.
I also have an Alzheimer's speech I am giving in Warner Robins Georgia which is a couple of hours away.
It has been on the schedule for a long time and it is important that I do it.
Then, I have family coming in for my great niece's graduation from Emory University.
So, all the things going on this week will help with me trying to keep my  mind off things -- if you can really do that.
Last night my husband and I attended a Billy Joel Concert in Atlanta.
I have never seen him in concert and it was a great show.
He sang for three hours straight and all great songs.
The show was held at the Suntrust Bank Baseball Field -- the new home of the Atlanta Braves.
We decided to stay the night in a hotel which was walking distance to the stadium so we didn't have to hassle with the parking and the commute at night.
That was perfect.
When we arrived at the hotel my daughter-in-law had brought by a little "goody bag" for us and in it my son left this note: So cute and clever.
Made me feel good after a long morning with the oncologist.

<doc date=Saturday, April 15, 2017>
First of All --  Isn't he cute?
Ian's first baseball game in Atlanta.
I know I'm prejudiced -- but he is a bundle of joy.
It's spring and the weather is beautiful in the south.
Lots of things are going on with festivals, graduations and outdoor sports.
This post is going to be long and probably ramble a bit, but as I titled this, indulge me.
I have a few speaking engagements coming up for the Alzheimer's Association and I have been trying to make some changes in some of my presentations.
One of the things I talk a lot about is the difference in funding research for Alzheimer's disease and other diseases like heart disease, cancer, and diabetes.
Alzheimer's is the only disease in the top ten diseases that cause death, that has no cure.
Yet, funding is proportionally lower for Alzheimer's disease that the rest.
I literally preach that we need to make Alzheimer's a CAUSE and perhaps people would look at it differently.
I know I am probably preaching to the choir here as most of you are my dear friends and give generously of your time and give financially to my "cause".
So, this week happened.
I was diagnosed with breast cancer.
Perhaps it hasn't sunk in yet, but my reaction to it hasn't been as devastating as I thought it would be.
We are in the initial phases or meeting with surgeons and doctors, etc.
But, with breast cancer I know there is a chance for survival.
Unlike with Alzheimer's.
And, it is because of all the research, all the dollars that have been given and people speaking out about breast cancer that has made this happen.
I know many people that have had breast cancer and survived -- the treatment might not be great but the end result is.
Those that have gone before me are my inspiration.
Several years ago when I was speaking to a class at UGA I mentioned that at one point a doctor at Emory told me that he would hope that I would die from something other than Alzheimer's.
I have thought about that a lot.
When I said this to the students one student asked if I was faced with another devastating illness would I seek treatment.
I told her I didn't know the answer to that and would have to wait until that situation ever presented itself (if it did).
Well, now here I am and yes, we will seek treatment because our chances are good and I can see a positive outcome.
I'm hoping that in time our Alzheimer's cause will have the same outcome.
Please continue to speak up, give and encourage people to look at Alzheimer's as the DISEASE that it is and help us fight this dreaded disease.

I had the pleasure of speaking to an OLLI group in Washington Georgia this week.
They were a very attentive group and I enjoyed sharing my story and information about Alzheimer's with them.
Thanks for the invite.
My week has been an emotional one and one that hasn't gone too well.
I cannot even begin to explain what has been going on right now so I won't.
but, tomorrow I get to see Ian and I know that will brighten my week.

It's the day after Christmas and I survived another one!
It wasn't so bad considering we had Ian to make us smile!
He was one month old on Christmas and a delight -- although his mom and dad probably don't think that when he is crying.
One nice thing about my son being on paternity leave is that he is a little more accessible to us and was able to go with me and my husband to my neurologist appointment on Friday.
I was really hesitant about getting a new doctor, but being stressed out with my other doctor took more of a toll on me.
But we loved the new doctor -- he spent a lot of time with us and we talked about a lot of things, some options available to me and it was such a relief.
I'm glad my son had an opportunity to meet him, as he may be dealing with him some day and at least they have met face to face.
Enjoy the rest of the holidays!

Just wanted to be sure to wish all of you a happy holiday season.
And, a new photo of Ian -- wouldn't you like to know what he is thinking?
I'm seeing a new neurologist this week.
Lots of reasons to change right now -- I sure hope we like him!
My best to you for a happy and healthy new year.

Ian Lee Bakowski entered the world last Friday, November 25th.
He was a week early but we are glad he is here.
His mom had a long labor but everyone is doing fine and they are home from the hospital.
I wasn't exactly sure what I was going to think when I saw my son holding his son for the first time, but it pretty much took my breath away.
Thanks to all of you who have sent their well wishes to Ian and his family and to Ralph and I.

Great job everyone!
Team Athens raised over $15,000.00 for the Athens Walk To End Alzheimer's.
Thanks to everyone who came out, donated and supported us in this year's event.
You are great!

I've had a problem in getting logged into this Blog for awhile but now I have been able to get back in, so I hope to be posting more.
Thanks for all your comments lately.
I have heard from so many people that have great questions and need information.
This month is Alzheimer's Awareness Month.
Today was actually World Alzheimer's Day.
I've had lots of requests to speak recently, but all have required some pretty long distance travel.
Usually, that isn't a problem, but one required me going to LA one day and returning the next.
With other things I have going on, there just wasn't anyway I could do that.
Traveling takes a pretty good toll on me and I know that those interviews I had to turn down, were covered by very capable people.
I'm glad that Alzheimer's is getting some news time.
We had our annual Walk To End Alzheimer's.
I was so proud of my team -- we raised close to $15,000.
Our Walk in Athens actually surpassed its goal this year for the first time in many years.
So excite about that and thanks to all of those that donated, walked and gave your support to my team.
In about a month a new Bakowski will be joining the family.
My son Alan and his wife Jennifer Lee are due with a baby boy.
We are looking forward to this joyous occasion.
Communication has become more of a problem for me.
I find it much harder to talk on the telephone, preferring emails or skyping with family.
It helps for me to be able to see the person when they are talking.
I plan in the next week or so to share some new reading material about Alzheimer's so stay tuned!

has been a long time to post.
I have gotten a lot of comments and emails lately about my journey with this disease so I will try to go back a little to give some perspective to it and answer some of the questions people have asked.
Question 1 -- What were your first symptoms?
I began having problems at work -- I was the manager of a 2,000 seat performing arts theatre and found that after 8 years I had problems doing familiar tasks, multi-tasking, trouble with working with numbers and dealing with season ticket holders and staff.
I first thought it was stress and being tired but I finally went to see a doctor when my symptoms got worse and I found myself somewhere and didn't know where I was or how I had gotten there.
Question 2 - What kind of tests did you have to determine your diagnosis?
I had about 8 months of testing which including all the usual lab tests, blood work.
Then I had a spinal tap and that showed a build up of tau in my brain (which cause the tangles in your brain with this disease) and also a gene that carried the Alzheimer's disease.
I also did intense neuropsychological testing.
I was "lucky" from the standpoint that I was diagnosed at an extreme early stage of the disease.
Question 3 - What kind of medicine are you on?
I take Exelon (patch) and Namenda.
I have some other medicines I take that are off label that help with some of the symptoms.
Question 4 - How are you still so functional?
I get this question a lot.
I know many people that have been diagnosed longer than I have and are more functional than I am.
As I said, this was caught early in the disease process and I personally think that makes a difference -- although medical personnel may disagree -- that is only my take on it.
I work at it -- try to stay active both physically and mentally.
There are many many things I cannot do and I won't go into them but I struggle just like everyone else.
It isn't easy -- but I do the best that I can.
It has taken a lot of effort to put down on paper what I have just written.
I used to do this with such ease and now after many hours thinking this through and writing it out several times (with help) I was able to get it this far.
I appreciate everyone's comments and only hope that if you or someone you know is dealing with this disease that you get help somewhere -- there are lots of resources out there.
I work closely with the Alzheimer's Association but there are others as well.
Check them out on the web and get some advice -- it doesn't cost anything to do some research and ask a few questions.
It has helped me and helped my family.
On a lighter note -- we are expecting our first grand child this fall -- and I am hoping that I will be able to enjoy the little one for a long time. 
</doc>
<doc date=Thursday, May 26, 2016>
We were delighted to learn on Mother's Day that our son and his lovely wife are going to be parents in November.
It will be our first grand child and I can't wait to see what is in store for our family.
But this month has also brought deaths.
Just yesterday I attended a funeral for a 32 year old (same age as my son).
And although this beautiful young lady had health issues it is still hard to mourn her loss and that of her parents.
Today, I received word that a friend of many years lost her valiant fight with cancer.
She was so tough and a real trooper through all of it.
My heart is broken about it.
She was brave and posted not long ago on her Facebook page that we must all love while we can, live while we can and stay in the moment.
This is so true -- a devastating illness shouldn't have to teach us this -- but many times it does.
I am finding it harder and harder to do things and it is getting me down.
I know I am to expect this considering how well I am doing, but it is frustrating.
It is hard to admit to friends that many things that are so simple are beyond my reach -- what more can I say?

to the Athens NARFE (National Association of Retired Federal Employees) group that had me speak yesterday.
They were a very gracious group and I appreciated the time they gave me.
My friend Lisa Genova sent me a message telling me that Greg O'Brien (a friend of her that has Alzheimer's and has written a book about it) will be on NOVA on PBS Wednesday night.
He will be with Rudy Tanzi -- an Alzheimer's researcher.
I've got it set to record -- hope you can catch it too.

since I lasted posted.
All my intentions of sitting down at the computer and adding some meaningful things to this blog seem to fade away before I actually sign in to this blog.
Anyway, thanks again to those who do follow this thing.
All the time I swear to do better and then I don't.
Obviously a lot has happened since I last logged in.
I have lost several friends in the last few months to cancer and other things.
As we get older I guess we should expect that but it is still hard.
And, when I go to their funerals or memorials I always think about what people will say when I am gone.
I know what I would want them to say -- but that probably isn't what they will say!
I have had a few more "episodes" as my husband calls them.
I am having some much harder days and have had to ask for a lot more help.
I am finding it more and more difficult to talk on the phone these days -- I think it is easier for me to see the person I am talking to.
Email and text messages work so much better for me because I can go back and re-read them if necessary.
Sometimes the most mundane things are hard -- like sorting things by color or trying to understand something I read.
I had my first real case of "wandering" which took my husband by surprise.
I find it is much harder to control my emotions and I will say things that I have always thought, but not allowed to get from my brain to my mouth!
That gets me into trouble, but trying to filter what I say is much much harder now.
I try to rationalize it that I am getting older and it is hard to be politically correct and to be "nice" but I know that isn't the real reason my outbursts explode!
I am still working through that bucket list of mine.
Tomorrow, one more thing will be crossed off as I have finally gotten my brother to Georgia and we are going to the Masters together.
I have been several times and I was fortunate to have my oldest brother (now deceased) come about 20 years ago and go with me.
So, it has always been my goal to get my brother Tom here for that experience.
We golfed as kids with two brothers and my dad it made for a good foursome.
My oldest brother played golf in college and my other brother and I have played sporadically over the years.
I used to be half way decent but I don't play enough now.
I am just glad that I am able to experience this with my brother after all these years of trying to make it happen.

Happy New Year.
It has been so long since I posted.
Those thoughts don't come as readily as they used to!
Hope everyone had a good holiday.
Our holiday was a little on the quiet side which was good for me.
My son and daughter-in-law spent the Christmas Holiday in Taiwan visiting Jennifer's extended family.
So, we didn't put as many decorations up and that suite me fine.
I don't like everything around the house because "it isn't the same".
Routine is important you know and little things like that can make a difference.
I was reflecting back on the year and realize it has been a quiet year too.
No big trips, no big surprises, no disasters --- which is a good thing.
Sad to say I lost a few friends and several friends are dealing with life threatening illnesses which is hard.
Others have fought their battles with illnesses and came out on top.
As we get older, I guess that is to be expected.
I turned the big 60 this year.
I need to go back and review my bucket list.
My son gave me one of the items on my bucket list " an IOU for a skydiving trip".
Something I have always wanted to do --we were going to try it last year but timing didn't work out for us.
He has promised this will be the year.
I am grateful to be doing as well as I am.
Still trying to stay active, and keep the brain active as well.
I have really had to say "no" a lot this year to give myself some breathing room.
Activities wear me out quickly so I have to cut back on some things -- but I am still plugging along.
I have been reconnected with many old friends this year and that is so nice.
It is hard to believe that I have known these people over 50 years -- that is a long time!
But it has been fun catching up with them and comparing our lives after all these years.
There are lots of things to look back on and wish we had done things a different way.
But, it is the new year and I hope all of you will look forward to a productive year.

I have been trying to get back to this blog for a long time and just keep getting sidetracked.
I am still here!
The last few years the holidays have made me anxious so I guess I am not looking forward to them like I used to.
I guess to many people, too much noise, too much of a lot of things, so I have to keep that in mind while going about my usual routine.
I have heard from many people recently about recent Alzheimer's diagnosis or people just looking for help.
I am glad people are reaching out instead of trying to cope on their own.
I was recently made aware of a new book Not All Who Wander Need Be Lost: Stories of Hope for Families Facing Alzheimer's and Dementia by Lisa Skinner.
It is an easy read and filled with lots of advice and ways of coping with people like me!
Lisa looks at everyday problems families face and offers some great solutions on dealing with certain situations.
It is definitely a book I would recommend to those having to care for someone with Alzheimer's or dementia.
The book can be found on Amazon.
Several friends have been dealing with some different health problems and I guess as we get older that is going to happen.
I don't think we necessarily see ourselves as older so sometimes thinking about my friends and what they are dealing doesn't seem possible.
But then, they probably say that about me too.
I don't know if many of the things I am experiencing now are just due to old age or the disease but many of the things I am experiencing aren't pleasant for me and I am sure they are not pleasant for my friends.
I hate it -- my emotions are all over the place and I never know how I am going to react to things.
Sometimes it just isn't pretty.
I know I am thankful that I still have friends -- despite how awful I must seem to them at times.

<doc date=Thursday, October 08, 2015>
And into the sixties......that will be me tomorrow.....I am finally turning 60.
I will take it -- considering what I thought my lifespan would be after getting my Alzheimer's diagnosis.
I am still around -- for better or worse -- and have the best support group of family and friends I could have.
Thanks to all of you for helping me through the tough times and celebrating the good times.
Someone asks me the other day if I remember thinking 60 was old when I was younger.
I don't think I really did -- but I never really thought about getting old.
It was going to come whether I was ready for it or not.
So, 60 is here tomorrow and hopefully, I will be too!

It always takes me by surprise how long it has been between my posts.
It doesn't seem that long.
Thanks for hanging in there with me, guys.
Not a lot of new things to report.
I have had a lot of comment on the Atlanta Magazine article.
It has certainly reached a lot of people and a lot of good has come from it.
I'm longing for a vacation at the beach -- which probably won't happen.
But I would really enjoy getting away and doing nothing.
I'm seriously thinking of trying to go by myself to the beach just for some alone time.
On another note, health problems hit all of us I guess in some way or another.
I just hate it when a bad diagnosis comes to good people.
Today I learned of such a diagnosis for a close friend.
She will get through it -- I have no doubt.
She has a great support network and loads of friends that she is always helping out when they are in need -- so they will be there for her -- as will I.  Luckily, medicine has come a long way in what she needs and I feel great about a positive outcome.
I wish it were that way for everyone.

<doc date=Monday, July 06, 2015>
The July issue of Atlanta Magazine is all about health this month.
I was fortunate enough to be asked to join a round table discussion about Alzheimer's for this issue.
Thanks to the editors for tackling this subject.
If you are coming to this blog from that article -- thank you.
If you are struggling with this disease -- know you are not alone.
There are many many resources out there to help.
I work with the Alzheimer's Association but there are other groups as well.
This disease isolates not only you but your family so try to reach out for help.
It is hard to ask for help -- believe me -- I know all about it.
But once you get over that hurdle the first time, it gets easier.
I haven't written in awhile.
So many attempts at sitting down at the computer and organizing my thoughts have failed lately that I just gave up.
Today, I guess I am on a roll.
The Longest Day -- a promotion by the Alzheimer's Association -- was held recently on June 21.
Groups are asked to do something for a day -- to help raise awareness and funds for Alzheimer's.
A gentleman in my community, Joe Sinkey, hosted a bridge tournament which he has done for several years.
It is part of a national program through a bridge association but this year Joe's tournament was in the top ten in the nation for funds raised.
So proud of him for doing this every year.
Thanks so much.
I have been experiencing major issues with vertigo lately and have undergone some tests.
My balance has been affected by the Alzheimer's but this is a different.
Am awaiting the results from my doctor.
But, I am still trying to play pickleball when I can to get that exercise in.
Certainly can tell a difference when I do.
Hope all of you are staying active -- remember what is good for the heart is good for the brain.
Thanks for reading my blog -- more soon.

Yesterday was not a good day.
I was playing Pickleball with my husband.
I usually play about three or four times a week, so that wasn't unusual.
But some days it is hard for me because there are too many people and too much noise.
I had played a few games and was doing o.k., but then I was playing with my husband (fortunately he was my partner) and all of a sudden it was like the walls were closing in on me, I got confused, didn't know what I was suppose to do and I had a full blown panic attack.
It has been awhile since I had one and I can usually feel them coming on, but not this one.
I had to get out of the gym as fast as I could.
My husband realized what was going on and helped to get me out.
it was as if the whole world was spinning around me and I could not get off the carousel.
It is hard to explain, but it can be terrifying if you do not know what is happening for you.
I went outside to get away from everything, but I couldn't set foot back in the gym.
My husband took me home and I had another one at home -- which isn't unusual for me -- seems like If I have one, I have another or several.
But I was feeling better because I was in a safe place.
It was a long day.

<doc date=Sunday, April 12, 2015>
I have been doing lots of things, but not found the organizational skills to put it down in writing.
I spoke to a wonderful group out in Crawford Georgia -- the Democratic Party hosted me for a talk.
There were some great questions out of that group and I appreciate the opportunity to talk with them.
The Public Policy Forum for Alzheimer's was held in Washington DC in the last few weeks.
A lot of really good information came out of the sessions.
I wasn't able to attend this year, but if you are interested in some new statistics here is a link to the 2015 Alzheimer's Facts and Figures .
What stuck out to me the most is the diagnostic rate of Alzheimer's.
In a nutshell, it says that only 45% of the patients are actually getting a diagnosis of Alzheimer's from their doctors.
We knew this, but now there is data to back it up.
This is a shame for a lot of reasons -- the biggest one to me is that for those diagnosed early, it hinders their ability to get Social Security Disability and other forms of help they so desperately need.
This, also doesn't help the stigma situation with the disease.
So much needs to be done in this area.
Last week, I met with several other people with a reporter from Atlanta Magazine.
They are doing a Health issue in July and Alzheimer's will be featured in one of the articles.
As part of our panel discussion, we were able to call my friend Lisa Genova - author of Still Alice for her take on what has happened since she first wrote the book and since the movie's release.
By the way, Lisa has a new book out this week about Huntington's Disease.
I haven't read it yet, but if it is as good as the rest of her books I will be recommending it.
I have had lots of comments and emails in the last few weeks from readers of the blog and I have been really slow to respond.
I promise I will try to get to everyone this week.
I appreciate all of your feedback.

It has been awhile since I have posted.
since that last post several things have happened -- I tore my MCL -- I went to Little Rock AR to see the SEC women's basketball tournament -- We had ice and six inches of snow while in Little Rock -- We stopped in Scottsbor, AL on the way home to visit Unclaimed Baggage Center -- you need to check them out!
-- my sister-in-law in Illinois fell and broke her leg at the ankle requiring surgery and a stint in the hospital with blood clots -- she is now rehabbing at home.
-- my son and daughter-in-law brought my great niece to Athens (she lives in Atlanta and attends Emory University) to see a UG gym meet for the first time.
My niece is a member of the Emory gymnastics club team.
since I posted about the SEC tournament, I wanted to mention that the women's basketball coach for the University of Georgia, Andy Landers retired this past week.
he has been the only full time coach UGA has ever had.
I am proud to call Andy a friend and will is seeing him on the sidelines next year.
I intend to write more about Coach Landers in another post I just haven't gotten it all sorted out in my head yet.
I was surprised by how much his retirement has affected me -- he has been the coach for the last 36 seasons -- exactly the number of years we have lived in Athens.
But, Andy has been much more than a coach to not only his players, but his fans as well.
He will be a hard man to replace.

Here is a photo of my lovely friend at the Oscars last night.
Lisa Genova, author of Still Alice.
She is beautiful.
So happy for her and Julianne Moore for winning best actress award last night. 
</doc>
<doc date=Wednesday, February 18, 2015>
Many of you have asked me about Still Alice and I have received numerous emails and messages regarding the movie.
I think I want to see it again -- it takes me awhile to catch on to everything you know.
There were several things in the movie that I think only those with the disease would understand.
For instance, when Alice is out running she gets confused as to where she is -- the movie shows her looking around and everything is a blur to her.
Now I am sure many of you can relate to what this is trying to say, but I think it is also a commentary on what is happening in our brain -- it is out focus as well.
There really isn't anyway to fight it -- you just have to hope that it passes quickly.
Then when Alice returned home her husband asked her about going out that night and she looked afraid and said she wanted to stay at home.
I feel safe at home.
When I am having a bad day I can't get home fast enough.
Home is familiar, home is where you feel comfortable, home is where no one can see you, home is peace.
I remember many times being on the treadmill in the gym and I have this sudden panic attack when I am not sure what is happening and I have had to immediately come home to feel "normal".
I don't go out much at night.
Things look different at night and I get too confused.
I used to be the one in the family that wanted to go out and do everything.
Now I am content staying at home in comfort and contentment.
I urge everyone to see the movie -- I am sure that I will have more to say as the days go on.
I do hope that Julianne Moore wins the Oscar this weekend.
So well deserved.
Thanks for reading.

<doc date=Tuesday, February 10, 2015>
On Sunday, my husband, son, daughter-in-law and I went to see Still Alice.
If you have been following this blog you know that I have told everyone to read the book.
It took me a very long time to read the book, because as I saw myself in the pages, it scared me.
"Alice" was (is) me.
I would read a little, put it down for days, pick it back up only to put it back down immediately.
When I finally finished it I was so glad the book had been written -- it so aptly described my life and those living with Alzheimer's disease.
My family had not read the book before we saw the movie.
I was anxious to see their reaction and to gauge my own.
My reaction -- at first I thought someone "had hit me in the gut".
Watching Alice cope with things, knowing what was going through her mind was wrenching for me.
The words she spoke were the exact same words I have spoken to my family or friends.
It was almost scary to see it -- to have her feel what you have felt and not being able to communicate it to others.
It is very moving -- I didn't cry until close to the end.
It was when Alice's daughter gives birth to twins and Alice goes to visit her in the hospital.
When she asks to hold the baby her son-in-law gives his wife a look as if he is saying "is she capable of holding the baby?".
Alice very quickly says "I know how to hold a baby" and the new father gives her one of the babies to hold.
This got to me because I have had this same scenario in my mind many times.
My son and his wife don't have children yet, but I have silently worried that if and when they do -- they won't feel as if I will be capable of holding the baby or being an appropriate grandmother.
After that scene, the floodgates opened for me.
There were many tears in the theatre that day.
I was emotionally spent after the movie.
At the end the screen goes white and people literally just sat in their seats and stared at the screen.
It was very emotional.
On the way back to my son's house, not much was said in the car.
Everyone was just trying to digest what they had seen.
Since they hadn't read the book, I think the impact of the movie was pretty strong.
Many who read this blog don't actually know me -- but if you see Still Alice -- you will know me.
Thanks to Lisa Genova, the author of Still Alice (and a friend of mine) for writing such an epic novel.
She had no idea when writing this book several years ago what an impact it would have on the Alzheimer's community.
I am so grateful to her and her work.
Still Alice is still in limited release but by the end of February it should be in many more theatres.
Don't miss the opportunity to see Julianne Moore's portrayal of Alice.

<doc date=Friday, January 23, 2015>
I have started this post many times and deleted it.
this time it is going to be published whether it is "polished" or not.
as my Alzheimer's progresses my emotions get out of control.
My feelings get hurt very easily.
I have written before how it has been hard for me to let go of things.
I don't know why I can't keep my emotions in check.
I don't know if I am imagining things, reading into things wrong, or just losing it at times.
But it really affects me when I am left out, forgotten or people just don't care enough, when I have put my heart and soul into a friendship that people do some of the things they do.
If I say something to them, they think I am being petty -- but it isn't petty to me.
We all have our thresholds I guess and mine is pretty low.
a couple of weeks ago I had two funerals in one day.
It brought sorrow and joy into my life -- sorrow for losing two individuals  so young, but joy to know how well they were loved and by getting to see so many people that helped celebrate their life.
Tomorrow brings yet another funeral.
I guess as we get older, funerals become the norm, but it is still hard.
This week I suffered a head injury and the doctor has deemed it a concussion.
Can't say I have ever had one of those, but it isn't pleasant.
Also this week I sat down and wrote several letters -- yes, actual letters.
I like writing letters "the old fashioned way".
One of the letters was to a man that I went to college with that has had a lasting affect on me.
Every time I went back to Illinois I would say I want to go by and see him.
I never got around to it.
so, I finally decided to sit down and tell him what our friendship meant to me and how he showed me a different way of thinking and how grateful I was to have had him as a friend.
I am glad I did that.
I am hoping next week will be better.

<doc date=Saturday, January 03, 2015>
is in the books and we are greeting 2015.
I started reflecting on the last year and was going to write all kinds of things, but realized they are probably only meaningful to me so I am going to spare you from that post right now.
But the past year took many people from my life and probably yours as well.
And, sickness has overcome many and some are not looking at real bright outcomes.
I guess as we age that is to be expected.
I am so thankful I am here so long after my Alzheiemer's diagnosis.
I guess that is why I seem to define my life in "time".
Time matters.
We take it for granted.
I want to spend my time doing things that matter to me not because someone expects it of me.
Everyone defines their life differently and as we mature we change those definitions every now and then.
Although my husband would never admit it, he defines his life by things.....what he has, what he wants, what he doesn't have.
He likes to be able to touch things, covet things and get better things.
I know that probably stems from not having much growing up.
And, I'm sure that my definition comes from never feeling like I had time to be with some members of my family -- like my dad.
My father always worked nights so he was home when we were in school and then he would be off to work when we came home.
I know I worked alot when my son was growing up and wasn't around as much as I wanted to be and I regret that.
I know that he probably does too.
So, it is something I will continue to work on -- to be there for my friends and family as best as I am able to.
For Christmas this year, I asked for nothing other than time.
I asked my son to spend time with me on Mother's Day (the actual day of Mother's Day).
I know that sounds silly but sometimes due to circumstances (or distance) we weren't together and I was bothered by that.
The actual day shouldn't make a difference, but for some reason I can't let that go.
So, for Christmas my son has already made arrangements for us to be together on Mother's Day.
From my husband, I asked for acknowledgement.
I asked that he acknowledge my birthday this year.
That sounds pretty silly too - doesn't it?
But it doesn't cost anything and I will be grateful if he will do this.
Speaking of letting it go -- I have had a hard time with that this year.
I think I have had a drastic shift in my thinking on this.
For so many years, I let things go that bothered me because I didn't want to confront it, didn't want to deal with or just couldn't be bothered.
But then I found it festering in me and getting upset with myself that I didn't deal with certain things and then found myself resenting people because of my inaction.
So now, I'm holding on to things too long and becoming frustrated so I have to find a happy medium.
Hopefully, I can do that soon.
I am so thankful for my friends.
I have made a lot of new friends this year and it has opened up some things for me that I didn't think were possible.
I am truly grateful for that.
I have had to make quite a few changes in my life this year and that hasn't been comfortable for some of those around me.
But, it has freed me up and I guess I am to the point where I am selfish enough now, to do things for me -- not others.
It has taken me almost 60 years to figure that out -- but better late than never -- right?
Happy New Year!

I know it has been awhile since I have written.
I just haven't been able to put my words down.
I think about what I am going to write and then I just can't get the words to go from my head to the page.
Lots of things have been going on -- not bad things -- but just a lot for me to keep track of.
Not doing the "multi-task" things so well anymore so everything just seems to pile up in my brain and I can't sort through anything.
Since I last wrote we have been to my son's in Atlanta for Thanksgiving.
We shared the day with my great niece who goes to Emory in Atlanta, my daughter-in-laws parents and her sister.
It was a great day....quiet and Jen and Alan did the cooking so it was an easy day for me.
Last weekend we spent time in Memphis with my nephew Jonathan and my sister-in-law Fran.
Jonathan ran his first marathon there.
I was so proud of him.
He ran in the St. Jude marathon.
Many years ago my great nephew had leukemia and was treated by St. Jude.
When Jonathan was looking for a marathon he chose the St. Jude charity as they had helped our family so much.
Jonathan came down from Champaign Illinois and brought his mom -- Fran.
I was so glad she could come as she has been pretty much housebound the past six years caring for my oldest brother who passed away this summer.
We rented a house while in Memphis and spent some time catching up and enjoying Jonathan's accomplishments.
But it was a tiring weekend and it took me all week to rest up after the long drive to Memphis.
Now that Christmas is almost upon us, I am trying my best to stay with my routine but it is hard.
I feel like I am a "day late and dollar short" with all the things I want to do, but feel overwhelmed.
I've asked my family for no presents this year, as I really don't need anything and I just want time with my family.
That is more precious to me and the best gift of all.

November has been a busy month with it being Alzheimer's Awareness month.
Thanks to all the groups that have had me come to speak to their members.
There has been lots of good conversations and questions coming from these groups.
With Thanksgiving right around the corner, I'm grateful I can still share my story.
And, I appreciate all that will listen.

This morning was our annual Walk To End Alzheimer's.
Thanks to all my family and friends that came out to walk.
Our team raised over $17,000 toward the cause!
Thanks so much!
Pictured above is me with my son Alan and UGA Women's Basketball Coach Andy Landers.
Coach Landers was gracious for walking with us and allowing the UGA Women's Basketball team to help with the Walk.
So proud to be a Lady Bulldog Fan!
Thanks to everyone who donated to the Walk -- I really appreciate your support!

I have had two speaking engagements in the last couple of weeks -- thanks to my new friends in Madison Georgia and the First Presbyterian group here in Athens.
I so appreciate you asking me to speak to your groups and meeting all of you.
Thanks for wanting to learn more about Alzheimer's and helping to spread the word about this dreaded disease.
A dear friend of mine, Kathy Davis, is holding an Alzheimer's fundraising awareness event at her church on Saturday October 11th.
It will be held at Moon's Grove Baptist Church, 1985 Moon's Grove Church Road in Colbert Georgia from 11am to 1 p.m.
The event will feature jewelry sales (all proceeds go to the Walk to End Alzheimer's), gel nail manicures, raffles and lots of fun for everyone.
Information about Alzheimer's will be available.
Also, my friend Kathy will be walking with us this year in the Walk To End Alzheimer's....see below.
She is asking everyone that comes to the event to bring a framed photo in honor or in memory of someone they know that has (had) Alzheimer's.
Kathy wants to then take a photo of all the photos gathered at the event and carry this photo with her in the walk.
She also wants families to sign a t-shirt she will wear on the day of the walk to remember and honor all of her friends and their families that are dealing with Alzheimer's.
It sounds like a great event and I would encourage all of those living out near Colbert to take a few minutes and go by Moon's Grove Baptist Church on Saturday October 11th and say hello to Kathy and do your part to End Alzheimer's.
1985 Moon's Grove Church Road - Colbert, GA 30628  -  706-7   This year's Athens Walk To End Alzheimer's is Saturday October 25th.
Thanks to all who have contributed to make our team-- Team Athens the top team for Athens so far.
If you still want to donate to the cause you may do so here -- any amount is appreciated!

I've had so many things going on, so many thoughts in my head, I couldn't get them down on paper.
So many things I have wanted to write about, but getting them out of the brain and through my fingers to the keyboard has been impossible the last few weeks.
I keep making notes of things I want to write about but then when it comes time to sit down and process all the information -- the "processing" fails.
Some days it is like that.....hard to express what you want to say......hard to even say the things you want to say.
I panic when I can't get the thoughts organized in my brain enough to share them.
I think "this is the beginning of the end", "I'll never be able to have a rational thought in my brain".
But, eventually, the thoughts become clearer and sharper.......for now.

About two and half months ago I had my left knee replaced.
I had my right knee replaced about three years ago.
I thought I remembered how long it took for therapy and getting back to "normal" was, but apparently not.
Although, this time around during and after prescribed physical therapy I took to the pool once a day and got stronger a lot faster than I thought I would.
So, last week, I started playing Pickleball again.
I am still not running -- kind of hobbling along best I can.
My partners have been good to me and compensated for my weaknesses.
But, one day I was playing and in an effort to "guard my knee" I took a tumble on the court.
It wasn't the first time I or others have fallen on the court.
We play on a basketball court and sometimes depending on the shoes you wear, your feet can get "stuck" on the floor -- so your body moves but your feet don't, and consequently, down you go.
Well, that is what happened to me and this was the result    a nice bruise to the right thigh.
But I didn't hurt my knee!
Tomorrow I am playing golf for the first time since my knee surgery -- let's hope nothing else happens.

We returned from Illinois where we celebrated my brother's life with his wife, my other brother and my brother's children and grandchildren.
It was nice to be with family.
My sister-in-law is doing well, but I know she is exhausted from everything.
Now that my brother is in a better place, we hope Fran will finally get to do some things she has not been able to do for the past few years.
My friends Pody and Rick also came to visit us while we were in Peoria.
They are the best friends.......I have many people that I consider "best friends" in the sense they are always there when you need them and even when you don't think you need them, they are there.
I had my knee replaced a little over two months ago.
I'm not sure if I posted that or not, but I'm glad to say that I am doing much better.
Thanks, in large part to swimming every day and my physical therapy.
This week, I went back to Pickleball -- even though my running is still not what it should be, I was able to play and that makes me happy.
Getting to see my little Pickleball family was good and it lifted my spirits.

As many of you know that have been following me for awhile my oldest brother, Bill has been in ill health for several years.
He has been on borrowed time.
But the end is near for him -- the past week has seen a heart attack and two strokes among other things.
He left the hospital today to go home to be with loved ones for his final few days.
We have known this day was coming -- but quite truthfully I thought this "time" had come many times before.
Now that it is finally here we know that he will be in a better place shortly and in no pain.
He is surrounded by his family.
Bill is 13 years older than me so I didn't real know him as a brother.
When I was in kindergarten he was in college.
I vaguely remember going to some basketball and football games he played in high school.
I also remember some times when he baby sat for me and my other brother (who is only two years older than me).
After my brother graduated from college he lived away from home, then married.
So, I really never spent a lot of time with him until we were both adults.
When I was out on my own, we only lived a few miles apart and worked in office buildings across the street from each other.
For about a year, every morning we would meet at 5am and play nine holes of golf together.
It still gave us time to go to our respective houses and change and get ready for work.
It is kind of strange that that is what I remember the most.
I can't remember who won the golf games, but I would be surprised if I won any of them since he played golf on his college team.
I am just grateful he shared that time with me.
He has requested no funeral, no memorial service and doesn't even want an obituary in the paper.
That is they way he wants it so that is the way it will be.
He will leave his wife of 45 years, three children, eight grandchildren and his first great grandchild is due in another month Since Bill was so much older than Tom and I he was much different than we were.
He was partly raised by my grandparents who lived next door to us.
We always joked that he came from a different gene pool than we did.
There are a lot of funny stories to share, but those will be saved for another time.
He will be missed.

Welcome Summer!
It is really hot here in the south already so I hope it is not an indication of what we have to look forward to all summer long.
Last year, about this time I was lamenting about running in the Peachtree Road Race (largest 10K in the country).
This year -- I'm not running or walking -- just watching.
My son and daughter-in-law are going to be running again and I am just going to watch them go by!
I do have an excuse this year, a few weeks ago I had my left knee replaced.
Three years ago I had my right one replaced and it was time for the left one to follow the same surgery.
I forgot a lot about what it was like, but my physical therapy is kicking into high gear and it is kicking me in the butt!
I don't remember it hurting like that before but it probably did.
Anyway, in a couple of months I will be good as new (well maybe not quite true) but will be much better off than I was a month or so ago.
Today is "The Longest Day" as it is the summer solstice.
However, you may have also seen a little publicity about Alzheimer's Longest Day.
Today, many groups and organizations are helping to raise money for Alzheimer's by doing an activity all day.
For instance, there is a group here in Athens that is playing bridge all day and raising money.
Others are running, sailing, playing scrabble, walking, playing basketball, etc.
to help raise awareness and much needed funds for research.
Thanks to all of those that are participating this year.
I hope next year, I can organize some of my friends and we can play Pickleball all day long!

I am sure I have heard every parent say at one time or another "it's not easy being a parent".
when do we ever stop taking responsibility for our children?
I know that we can't be responsible for everything they do and certainly when they are adults it is hard to bear that burden.
But lately, I have been feeling bad about some things my son has or has not done, and while he is an adult, I feel bad as a parent, because I didn't raise him that way.
I didn't teach him some of his behavior but it had to come from his upbringing right?
My son is not a bad person by any stretch of the imagination, and I am very proud of what he has made of himself, but I am disappointed in some of the ways he has dealt with some things and I feel responsible because I didn't do a good enough job in teaching him.
I am sure that some of these things are trivial to others, and the way young people do things these days are totally different than the way we would have done something at that age, but it makes me stop and think about parenting and how little things really can make a difference.

Many of you have purchased this book and I appreciate it!
All royalties for this book are going to the Alzheimer's Association.
Since its release on April 22nd, the book rose to number 16 on Amazon's book list.
In fact, Amazon ran out of books and the book has been sent for a second printing already.
I have heard from many of you about some of the stories in the book.
I haven't made it all the way through the book yet, but I was surprised at how much I learned from the book.
One lady emailed me that she bought 10 copies of it.
It can also be found at Barnes and Noble, and someone also told me they downloaded it as an e-book, but I haven't checked that out for myself yet.
I was honored to be one of the many people to be able to share their story in this book.
Thanks to all those that put it together.
If you like the book, please let me know.
I would love to hear from you.
Check with your local Alzheimer's Associations, too, as some may have book signings or readings where you can get your copy.

I know I haven't posted in awhile.
Thoughts not in the right place to get down on paper.
This weekend our son and daughter-in-law paid us a visit.
It was so nice to have them here -- I'm always a little sad when they leave.
I know that sounds pathetic, but I miss them even though they only live about 75 miles away.
They are busy.
They work a lot and they have their own lives so we hate to intrude into their time.
But I do miss them nonetheless.
I have been going to physical therapy for some back problems.
Yesterday, when I was there I wasn't having a particular day and I found myself having a problem following directions.
It was kind of like when I have a problem making change -- my brain knows what to do, I just can't physically do it.
So, when the therapist asked me to lie and my back and put my feet flat on the table so my knees were upright I couldn't do it.
I knew what he was telling me to do, I just couldn't do it.
Now the therapist doesn't know of my condition, so he just kind of moved my legs for me.
A couple of other times he asked me to do something and I couldn't figure out what he was telling me to do.
I should have something, but I didn't.
I am sure he thinks I am an idiot because I couldn't do simple tasks.
My husband told me I should have said something -- next trip I will.
I just hate bringing it up if I don't have to -- but perhaps this is one of those "have to" situations.
I just feel so stupid.

It was a great conference, almost 1,000 people there.......all dressed in purple.
I will post some photos soon.
But, this year, the conference got to me.
really got to me.....it was way too much for me.
By the time we got to the airport to come home I literally didn't know if I was coming or going.
had a meltdown at the airport and on the plane.
glad Ralph was with me, because I am not sure what I would have done if he hadn't been there.

I have written in the past about the state of Georgia working on a state plan to address Alzheimer's.
I am happy to say that the legislature passed the plan in this last session and we should see the results of the work of the committees soon.
Thanks to all that worked on that plan and I know it will be a valuable tool moving forward.
I also wrote a few weeks ago about the "Chicken Soup for the Soul, Living with Alzheimer's and Other Dementias" a few weeks ago.
Today I received an advance copy of the book and if you are dealing with Alzheimer's in your family, I highly recommend the book.
I haven't been able to read all the 101 stories but they all deal with caregiving, coping and compassion.
You will definitely learn something from these stories.
Thanks to all who put this together.
It hits book stores mid-April.

Over the last couple of days, I have been at the SEC women's basketball tournament.
Today, players were wearing "We Back Pat" thirsts over their jerseys in honor of Pat Summitt and her foundation to fight Alzheimer's.
I was not having a particularly good day, but several people told me they wanted We Back Kris shirts.
how sweet is that.
it didn't make my day go much better, but I felt loved.....thank you!

A while back I posted about the internal debate I have in my head lots of times about whether to share with people that I have Alzheimer's.
It isn't something that usually comes up in conversation obviously.
Many times I fear saying something because I am afraid that people will treat me differently -- which if you have been reading my blog for awhile, you will know that is usually the case.
So, more times than not, I don't say anything.
About five months ago I started playing Pickleball a few times a week.
At times, the noise got to be a little too much, so I resorted to putting my earplugs in.
Then the distraction from other people when they were not playing bothered me, so I realized that if I stay on a certain side of the court I do better -- one without as many distractions.
Is this fair?
I don't know if it is or not, but because of these things I have told a few people about my disease, partly in hopes they would then realize I was not trying to cheat by being on a certain side of the net.
I have been so pleased with the people that I play with -- they only don't treat me any differently, but now watch out for me on the court and never ask me to play on the other side of the net.
I love these people -- I feel like I am really "normal" around them!

February 13th is Alzheimer's Awareness Day at the Georgia State Capitol.
A lot of work has gone into a new state plan to address Alzheimer's in the state.
If you would like to attend, you must register and you can do so by going here: http://act.alz.org/site/PageNavigator/GA_GA_action_center.html All the information you need about the day can be found here and I would encourage any of you that can go to take a day and support this issue.
On another note, another Advocacy Day is coming up in the state of Washington and they need your help.
I received an email from the Tacoma Alzheimer's group and to help them get a plan started they need help.

A lot has been going on but I just haven't had my thoughts straight enough to jot everything down so I'm going to give it a try --- 1.
Winter weather -- yes, the South was hit hard yesterday by snow and ice.
Although Athens didn't get hit hard, Atlanta did.
The snow really wasn't the issue as much as the traffic.
People were stranded in their cars for as many as 8 or 10 hours (or even longer) trying to get home yesterday.
It was a mess.
When I lived in the North I would have been somewhat prepared -- we always carried an emergency kit if you will in our trunk to sustain us for a short time, but I am not sure if it would have sustained us that long.
I was thinking that now, though, I would have had a number of panic attacks and not sure how I would have handled being stranded on interstate roads for that long.
A silly think (or maybe not so silly) is that I still keep in my trunk, a duffel bag with "necessities" including water, make-up, and overnight essentials.
I know that sounds silly, but I used to travel in my job at the spur of the moment so I always had a bag packed in my trunk.
It came in handy even if I wasn't travelling.
My husband gives me a hard time, but it is my "comfort", so he just has to deal with it!
2.
Drug trials -- was disappointed that two drugs that seemed to hold some promise for those of us with Alzheimer's have not been proven in recent drug trials.
This is so disappointing.
Here is an excerpt from an article published in US News and World Report: "Two experimental drugs for Alzheimer's disease have failed their clinical trials, proving unable to help patients with mild to moderate dementia, according to new studies.
Both bapineuzumab and solanezumab did not improve patients' ability to think and solve problems, according to findings published in the Jan. 23 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine.
The drugs were intended to help people with Alzheimer's by clearing the amyloid beta protein plaques that typically clog neurons in the brains of people with the degenerative illness, the researchers said.
Neither medication improved patients' ability to think.
"We were disappointed there was no clear clinical benefit," said Dr. Steven Salloway, lead researcher on the bapineuzumab study.
Salloway is a professor of neurology and psychiatry at the Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University."
You can read the whole article here: http://health.usnews.com/health-news/news/articles/2014/01/22/2-alzheimers-drugs-found-ineffective-in-clinical-trials 3.
On a better note -- A funding bill for the 2014 federal budged included the largest increase in funding dedicated to Alzheimer's and dementia - $122 million in funding for Alzheimer's research, education, outreach and caregiver support in history.
You can read more about that news at: http://www.alz.org/news_and_events_122_mill_posposed.asp 4.
On a bright and happy note -- my friend author Lisa Genova who wrote Still Alice announced yesterday the full cast of the film adaptation of Still Alice.
It was announced previously that Julianne Moore would play Alice.
Others cast include Alec Baldwin, Kristen Stewart, and Kate Bosworth.
Filming is set to start soon.
I couldn't be happier for Lisa.
Lisa lives in Cape Cod and this article appeared today in Cape Cod Today -- http://www.capecodtoday.com/article/2014/01/29/23796-hollywood-bring-chatham-authors-still-alice-silver-screen Lisa was in Columbus Georgia this weekend, and unfortunately, I wasn't able to get to visit with her due to some other commitments.
I was sad about that, but I am so happy for her that this film is closer and closer to a reality.

The New Year for me began by saying goodbye to a friend -- see post below.
It was a hard day for me.
Someone just a year older than I succumbing to Alzheimer's.
A beautiful tribute was given to him on Saturday and I am certainly proud to have known him.
I love catching up with old friends and the holidays are always a good time to do that.
I love getting everyone's Christmas photos and their Christmas letters.
I know many people don't like to read them, I do.
With social media the way it is now, we don't get all the details of what is happening with people and their families.
Thanks to all who sent me something -- I really do enjoy hearing from you.
And, thanks too, to old friends who have re-connected through Facebook or this blog.
I was so happy to hear from a former (I'm not going to say old) neighbor who shared her time with us as well as her children with Alan.
How nice to be remembered.
Another friend, Dr. Mary Cail, who wrote The All Weather Friend's Guide To Alzheimer's, has revised this book and re-released it as "Alzheimer's A Crash Course for Friends and Relatives".
(Note: Full disclosure -- she does have some excerpts from this blog in the book).
She was kind enough to send me a copy over the holidays and I would highly recommend this book.
If you want to know how to deal with your loved one with Alzheimer's, please get this book.
It will save you a lot of frustration and time.
Mary has achieved a great sense of balance in the book and will help you immensely.
I'm revising the bucket list and trying to shape my 2014 so I will be back shortly.

I didn't realize it had been so long since I posted.
I know in my head I have been posting as I have kept thinking of things I wanted to say.
So, here goes........
The last few weeks have seen loved ones pass away, loved ones moving on to a different city, and old friends reuniting.
It's a mixed bag of feelings.
Word came this week to me that a friend in Atlanta had passed away from Alzheimer's.
He was 59 years old.
We had become friends many years ago through this disease and we shared things others couldn't.
We'd laugh at ourselves, understood things only we would know about and share our families.
Several times Bob and I shared a stage at meetings about Alzheimer's and he his wife were featured in Washington at one of the Public Policy Forums.
Bob's wife, Trish, first contacted me through this blog and since we lived close we got together.
Bob was only a year older than I was and we all seemed to get along well.
One of their children was going to UGA at the time, so they came to Athens often and came to our Walk to End Alzheimer's here in Athens for several years.
I always thought of Bob as a "gentle giant".
He was not big, but he was tall -- I was always looking up to him (both literally and figuratively) and he was soft spoken, loved his family and was very aware of what he was dealing with.
Unfortunately, Bob's type of Alzheimer's was definitely inherited and he had been dealing with it in several members of his family for some time.
This type tends to be more aggressive than other types.
Bob was a runner and his family shared his passion.
I'm sorry he couldn't outrun this disease.
We will pay our final respect to Bob this Saturday but he will never be forgotten.

Today I got to meet the talented lady behind "Cake Pops".
She does some amazing things with cake and when I grow up I want to be her!
She made a stop today at the UGA bookstore and did a book signing.
Her books about Cake Pops and Holiday Cake Pops can be purchased through Amazon or at your local Barnes and Noble.
I wish I had the patience to decorate these little nuggets like she does, but mine never turn out like hers!
Maybe one day............ but it exercises my brain and that is a good thing -- even if I can't make the magic like she does.
Here are some examples of her work --       Thanks for your time today Bakerella I enjoyed meeting you.

I know I have been a little MIA lately.
Lots of things going on and not able to get my thoughts together like I want to.
I haven't taken the opportunity to thank everyone who donated to the Walk To End Alzheimer's.
And, those on my team that raised so much money.
Thanks from the bottom of my heart for helping fight the fight.
Tomorrow will be a day filled with family, fun and laughter.
We are heading to Atlanta to be with my son and daughter-in-law and her delightful family (including her sister who has flown in from San Francisco).
We are blessed to be able to be all together because for so many years we were not.
It makes it even more special for us.
This year, the Classic Center (where I used to work) has installed a portable ice rink which will be open for public skating in December.
I'm excited about that -- I love to ice skate.
I was a figure skater when I was much much younger!
When I moved to Athens almost 34 years ago I thought it was horrible that I could no longer skate.
There were a few rinks tucked away in Atlanta but they were not close enough.
Although my husband had skated as a youngster, skating really isn't his thing -- you may remember several years ago when he decided to go skating with us (Alan, Jen and her family) and fell and broke his elbow -- no more ice for him.
He is now a bystander!
Anyway, I have found places to skate in Atlanta that are a little more convenient although I don't go nearly enough.
But now that the rink is here for at least a few weeks I can enjoy it without having to go too far!
Now, how many of my friends will join me on the ice?
We'll see who my real friends are won't we?
And, Carol -- if you are reading this you cannot come skating -- even if you wanted to.
That poor boy you traumatized by running over him on the Rockefeller Center rink 15 years ago or so is probably still traumatized!
To mark the occasion of skating in Athens I crafted a pair of skates out of scrapbook material.
Happy Thanksgiving to everyone!

I have two friends in particular that are a lot like me -- maybe that is why we are friends!
Anyway, it is not uncommon for us to buy the same presents for each other on special occasions.
And, when shopping for these two friends, I know that what I like, they will like.
I met with one of these friends this week for a belated birthday celebration for me.
This friend is always dressed perfectly, her hair is always perfect, her house is always decorated perfectly -- well you get the picture.
If I didn't love her I would probably hate her.
Anyway, I will never look like her and be as polished as she is.
But, for my birthday she gave me some soap and cream that she uses all the time and swears by it.
I have wanted to try it but it was expensive and I don't usually indulge myself in such things.
My friend certainly looks no where near her age and I guess this has been her "secret formula".
So now, although I won't be like her -- I'll smell like her and maybe get rid of some of these wrinkles in the mean time.

I am so happy that my friend Lisa  Genova's book, Still Alice is being made into a movie.
filming begins in February and Julianne Moore has been tapped to play Alice.
I am so excited  for Lisa.
If you haven't read Still Alice, you need to TODAY!
It is a fiction book about a young Harvard professor that is diagnosed with Alzheimer's.
Lisa and I did not know each other at the time she wrote this book, but that is my life.
It was eerily scary to read for me, but it is a fabulous book.
Congratulations to my friend!

Over the last six months or so, I have come into contact with a whole new set of people by joining a new organization.
And, having found myself in a social situation with many of these people, I never know if it is appropriate to share my Alzheimer's diagnosis with them or not.
I see no reason to, until an opportunity arises.
However, on several occasions, that opportunity passed and then I thought if I said something after the fact it would be awkward.
I do find that as I am getting older, and those around me are older that the conversation turns to Alzheimer's in one form or another -- usually someone talking about their parents or a friend having the disease.
I'm afraid if I say something at that point that it becomes a sensitive subject and people will not feel free to discuss it.
But then on the other hand, if they find out I have it, then they wonder if they said something that might have offended me.
That isn't usually the case, but if the circumstances were reversed I could see how this would be.
So, I am never quite sure when to speak up.

It's always a joy to talk with her students.
And, a big thank you to my friends John and Shirley, for inviting me to Lanier Village Estates last night.
There was a great crowd there for my presentation, and it was topped off with a delicious meal.
I really appreciated this opportunity to meet some new people and visit with some of the residents after my talk.
Thanks again!

Last week I was in New York City.
Since I have been to NYC so many times I am pretty comfortable.
Although the crowds still get to me.
I had a little breakdown on the ferry to the Statue of Liberty.
The people, the noise were just too confusing to me.
I wasn't on my own too much while in the city.
But one of the problems I have chronicled here is having a problem crossing the streets.
The signals are confusing for me.
Since there is little consistency in Walk Lights, I get confused.
I think the blinking of the walk light in conjunction with the traffic signals, the traffic noise and all the people is overload on my brain.
So, I do better when I am with someone to cross the street than on my own.
Despite my problems, I still enjoyed the trip.
Thanks to all for the birthday wishes.
My son turns 30 today.
That makes me feel old.
But I am glad I am still able to spend some quality time, as I know down the road it won't be as easy.
Two speaking gigs this week -- a class at the University of Georgia and a retirement community in Northeast Georgia.
Thanks for reading and keeping up with me.

Next week is my birthday and my dear friends, Suzanne and Joe took my fishing for a birthday present.
With the help of our friend William, we went to Lake Russell and caught some fish.
My friend Suzanne caught the first "big" fish -- a 23+lb.
hybrid bass.
That was a great catch.
Suzanne and William with her prize catch Then I caught a large mouth bass Then Suzanne and I caught a couple of small fish Then I caught a 23+lb.
striped bass Joe caught some fish too -- but we didn't snap a photo of him.
He and William helped us reel those big ones in -- they fought us most of the way but we did it.
Thanks to everyone for a great birthday present -- not only fish, but fun, laughter and a beautiful day with beautiful friends!

My mind is doing crazy things lately and that is why I haven't posted.
I thought the topic of this post was funny -- go figure.
I'm working on several projects right now that require writing and I am struggling big time.
I have all these thoughts going through my head and if I could put them together I would have a great story!
Maybe I need an editor.
I know a few but they are busy.
I have been traveling a little lately.
Went to Illinois to my 40th high school reunion.
It wasn't as traumatic as people kept telling me it was.
In fact, it was nice to see some old friends.
My brother had some more surgery while I was there so times was spent at the hospital.
Since my last visit I have had a new great nephew born so a visit with him was necessary as well as all my other relatives.
My other brother got a new Pekingese and since he has three they are his children so of course a visit to see "Charlie Brown" was also on my agenda.
One of my best friends, Pody, also came up from Champaign to visit for a short time.
I was only there about four days but I saw a lot of people.
When I came back I had some meetings in Atlanta for the Alz.
Association and also went to the FEDEX Cup golf tournament at East Lake for tow days.
Beautiful weather and lots of fun seeing the pros play.
Here are a few photos from the trips.
More soon.

I spent last weekend with some "thirty something" friends.
One said she had been thinking about her bucket list since I have mentioned mine many times.
I'm glad that she is thinking about it now, while she is young and has more time to fulfill that bucket list.
I have started to re-evaluate mine every few months.....adding a few things as I go.
As I have mentioned before -- some of these probably should be on my bucket list because they are out of my control, but I can wish for them just the same.
Bucket List -- out of my control -- kind of in order of priority if I could make them happen!
1.
Get tickets for myself, husband, son, daughter-in-law and brother to go to the Master's Golf Tournament in Augusta.
I've tried for years to get tickets and "it ain't happenin" as they say in the south.
2.
Become a grandparent -- definitely out of my control.
3.
Make a hole in one -- technically I guess I could be in control of this, but yet again, as they say in the south "it ain't happenin".
4.
Find a cure for Alzheiemer's -- definitely out of my control.
Real Bucket List 1.
Go Skydiving 2.
Go to a corn maze 3.
Go to Denver and see a concert at Red Rocks  4.
Travel to Europe again 5.
Go on a girls weekend somewhere for fun 6.
Own and red Mazda Miata 7.
Add a screened in porch to my house 8.
Be skinny 9.
Make a difference to someone 10.
Have more patience with myself and my family.
11.
Go to Wimbledon again 12.
Go to Italy I am sure in the next few months this list will change.
On another thought........I have been thinking about this whole memory loss issue.
In thinking about short term memory loss, is it the fact that we cannot remember or is it the result of not processing the information?
I have found that I have a difficult time processing information, so when someone tells me something or I read it, I don't fully process that information, so I couldn't recall it if I never understood the information in the first place.
I wonder if this isn't the case sometimes, rather than just forgetting something.
You can't forget something you never had in the first place.
This probably only makes sense to me!

There is a reason this blog is called "Creating memories".
It's because when I was first diagnosed with Alzheimer's the first thing I realized was that my "memories" would fade over time.
So, I set out documenting things like the boxes and boxes of photos we had accumulated over the years.
I re-evaluated my "bucket list" to see how many things I could accomplish and realized that I had short time to "create new memories" for my family.
This all came to mind when I was with my son this week.
I shared something with him that I thought I had told him long ago, and his response was "you never told me that".
Then he started to laugh as he recounted all the times in his almost thirty years that he had said that to me.
You honestly don't think to tell your children everything that happened in your childhood.
And, since we don't live near relatives there are not many people around recounting stories of what I did or did not do growing up.
When I look back at my life growing up I realize a lot of it surrounds sports.
My oldest brother was an athlete in high school playing football and basketball.
I don't remember a lot of that because he was so much older than I was (I was in kindergarten when he went off to college), but I do remember some of his broken bones from football.
Long after my brother was out of college he returned home and by then I had taken up many sports including figure skating, tennis and golf, to name a few.
My brother played golf on his college team so when he came home we started playing golf together.
When I started working full time, every morning at 5:00 a.m. we would meet at the golf course and play nine holes before we would go off to work.
That's how I really got to know my older brother.
My other brother who is two years older than I am was always playing baseball, bowling, basketball or golf.
I was a tomboy and always wanted to be out in the school yard next to our house to play with the guys.
He would put me in the outfield (knowing I hated it), and then would complain to my mom that I was out there turning cartwheels instead of paying attention to the game (which I was).
My dad loved to fish.
He fished almost every day of his life.
He was really into tying his own fishing flies.
My brothers didn't like to go fishing -- they said it was boring.
I wanted to go with my dad, just because I wanted to spend time with him.
He worked nights and would come home and make himself some breakfast, go fishing, come home sleep, get up and start all over again.
So, when I was in school he was  fishing or sleeping and when I was home, he was at work.
So weekends were my time to go fishing with my dad.
He also accompanied my brother and I out on the golf course.
Since my dad passed away over thirty years ago, those memories of just the two of us in the boat on hot summer days are precious to me.
I hate to think I will lose them.
My sports were figure skating (and the competitions that went along with that), tennis and golf.
I played an occasional summer league of softball every now and then, but girls were not encouraged into sports when I was growing up.
I loved to be outside so sports is what I was doing, whether on a frozen pond in the winter, or a tennis court in the summer (plus indoor tennis in the winter in Illinois).
The reason I went into this is that many of my "memories" of growing up revolved around sports.
(I was also heavily involved in theater and music but that is for another blog entry.)
On my bucket list there are many sporting events that I still want to see and experience with my son.
I'm only reminded of this as this week I received my annual "you did not get tickets in the lottery for the Master's tournament" again -- I've been trying for a long time.
I want to experience that with him as well as my brother -- and although we all enter the lottery every year we don't get tickets.
I also put in the lottery for tickets for an NCAA Final Four men's basketball tournament.
I've experienced a Final Four women's tournament with my son, but the men's side is more exciting.
So, we will keep trying and hope that those items come off that bucket list while I am still able to enjoy them.
When we think of "memories" it is mostly about experiences.
My husband doesn't enjoy "experiences".
If I could spend my money any way I wanted I would travel and experience some of the things the world has to offer as well as those sporting events I would like to see.
My husband enjoys "things".
He wants to be able to look at something, hold it, and cherish it.
He didn't have a lot growing up so this is important to him.
We didn't have a lot growing up either, but we had tennis rackets, ice skates and baseballs!
So, we argue a lot in our house about vacations versus things.
Making memories is not that important to him.
Fortunately (the way I see it anyway) my son is on my side when it comes to experiences -- he tries to buy gifts for us like tickets to a show, sporting event or to an event we would like to see.
So, I will try to experience what I can and hopefully my son will have fond memories of some of our experiences together -- long after I will be able to remember them.

It's been a weird week.
I seem to be about a step behind in everything I do.
I'm very unsettled and I don't do well when I am.
And, I can't pinpoint the problem, it just happens.
I have a lot on my mind and since my mind doesn't function properly, it's like these things get stuck in my mind and there is no room for everything else to go into it.
The things on my mind are weighing heavily on me right now.
I used to be able to let things go, but that is more difficult for me now.
I focus on them so much that they eat away at me.
My patience wears thin and I can get pretty cranky.
When I was young and someone would tell me that I was cranky I would go take a nap and that seemed to help.
Taking a nap these days doesn't help so much.
I just re-read this and it rambles -- sorry about that.
Can't seem to capture the words the way I want them today.

I have lots of things to write about but I'm having one of those days where I can't get what is in my brain to the keyboard.
So, probably most of it will have to wait.
But, I wanted to tell you that you may be seeing lots of information in the next few days about Alzheimer's research.
The Alzheimer's Association is hosting their annual Research conference in Boston and it brings people from all over the world together to talk about what is being done to find a cure for Alzheimers.
I attended one of these meetings once and was blown away by how much is being done internationally.
For updates on the meeting you can go to www.alz.org.
Promise to be back soon.

I mentioned a few posts back about a few friends who are dealing with some major medical issues.
One of those people, my friend Chris D. Is battling stage four colon cancer.
I have known Chris for about fifteen years.
We met through a professional organization.
She lives in Atlanta so I don't see her too often.
But, we have lots of things in common.
Chris is a lot of things but "fighter" comes to mind first and foremost.
Another thing she is is an athlete.
Looking at this petite woman you wouldn't really think that.
Among other things she is a marathon runner.
When I am out running, I constantly think about Chris.
She keeps me going when I don't think I can go any longer.
I know she is going to beat this cancer, because she is so determined and strong.
although she is probably younger than I am, I want to be her when I grow up.
thanks for keeping me going Chris.
You are an inspiration and motivator.

This morning, my daughter-in-law and I did the Peachtree course.
I walked most of the way and she ran most of the wait.
she was kind enough to wait up for me in spots, so I defintely slowed her down.
But we did 6.5 miles in 1:45.
My goal is to finish in two hours so if I can hold to that I should be o.k.
I have a few more weeks to train.

As I try to train for the Peachtree Road Race, I have lots of time to think.
That's probably not a good thing.
But, some of the things I have thought of lately are: If I set a goal to come in last at the Peachree I can probably achieve that goal.
Was wondering if I could take my number off during the race and give it to someone else that would finish faster and have them carry it across the finish line Make a sign to put on my back that says"  Caution Student Driver  Runner -- Expect Delays Too much time to think.

As I try to prepare myself to run  walk the Peachtree Road Race in July, it seems like a big hurdle to jump.
I'm not a runner, never been a runner.
But, as I diligently trudge my old overweight body out to the streets to  try to run -- the hurdle seems to get taller and taller.
However, as I trudge up and down the hills I think of two of my friends battling breast cancer, another friend who just lost her 61 year old husband, and another friend that just found out she has stage four colon cancer.
Those are big hurdles.....mine is not.

It's hard for me to write this, but considering this is a blog about Dealing With Alzheimer's I must.
This past Monday was really hard.
My husband was in St. Louis visiting his family.
those of you that follow my blog know that I usually enjoy my time alone when he leaves -- it's real quiet and peaceful!
And, it had been for several days.
But then Monday morning came around.
I had purchased a new fishing rod and reel on Sunday.
On Monday morning, I went to adjust the line and get it in working order.
When I started to do it, it confused me.
I couldn't quite figure out how to do it -- but it's pretty simple you know?
I got frustrated pretty quickly and thought I'll just put it aside and come to it later.
I then decided to go into my craft room and try to clean and straighten up the mess I had in there.
When I went into the room, I couldn't clean it.
I looked at everything -- there were stacks of paper everywhere, scissors, scraps of paper on the floor, etc.
I knew that eventually I had to run the vacuum in that room, but I couldn't figure out how to pick things up off the floor in order to vacuum.
I couldn't pick up the stacks of paper I had laying around and organize them or even straighten them to put away in their nice cubby hole.
How hard is it to pick something up off the floor?
But I could not do it.
I decided to try something else.
I then went to do some laundry.
I got the clothes in the washing machine, but I couldn't figure out how to turn the washer on.
I should be able to do that in my sleep right?
I decided to leave that task and go outside for some fresh air.
I had a major panic attack and couldn't go outside.
I had become a prisoner in my own house and couldn't do anything.
I realized I was not in a good situation with all of this happening.
I called several friends at home and at work and either they were not home or they weren't in their office.
So, I broke down.
I'm not a "crier", but I started to cry and I didn't stop.
I tried to call my husband in St. Louis -- he knows how I get when things like this happen.
But he wasn't answering his phone.
Then I called my son.
He has not experienced me this way and I am sure I scared him.
When I am like this, I can only tell you that "I can't do anything".
I am not capable of telling you all the things I can't do -- all I can get out of my mouth is "I can't do anything".
I'm sure when my son picked up the phone and I was sobbing out of control he figured something had happened to me or his dad.
He offered to come over but I told him no I just needed to hear his voice.
After that phone call I finally got in touch with my husband, and although he wasn't here with me, he understood what was happening to me and it made me feel better.
But it makes me feel so stupid when I can't do the simplest things.
Logically, I know I am not stupid, but I can't get that out of my mind.
I had thought of calling a neighbor to come help me but I didn't want to tell them that I couldn't turn my washer on!
I feel like I have a big "S" on my head for stupid.
The thing about these episodes is that I know what I am suppose to do, but I cannot physically do it.
It's like the instructions are written in a foreign language.
The thought is in my brain but it can't be relayed into action.
As you can imagine it is very frustrating.
Things like this happen to me all the time, but not usually all at one time.
Luckily, I didn't have anything that I absolutely had to do that day and of course I didn't.
I honestly don't remember much of the rest of the day other than my husband and son both called to check on me.
I was still crying a lot during the day which is not like me.
The rest of the week has been much better compared to my Meltdown Monday.

I'm so proud of some of my young friends who are graduating in the next few months.
My beautiful great neice Amelia (pictured below) is graduating at the top of her senior class at the ripe old age of 16 -- yes, 16.
We are so proud of her.
She has been accepted to several universities -- two in Atlanta  so we are hoping to see more of her.
She'll be majoring in bio medical engineering.
My friend Christopher will be graduating from med school, and my friend Josh has decided to go for his PhD.
I'm proud of everyone but as I write this I think that it also makes me feel old!
Today I had the privilege of going to a breakfast put on by the Grady College of Journalism at UGA.
A friend of mine received a "Lifetime Achievement" award.
While there I was re-acquainted with many people that I have worked with on various projects throughout the years.
Two of them told me they read my blog and I was amazed -- but thank you both for telling me that you do click on here occasionally and keep up with my upside down world.
It was nice to see everyone and congrats to my friend who certainly deserved it.

When most people think about Alzheimer's many only think of people losing their memory.
But it is so much more.
It's getting confused about the simplest things, not being able to make change in a store, not being able to follow a conversation, having a problem crossing the street, not being able to productive.
Memory is still a big part of the whole picture, but medicine has been somewhat helpful for me.
I worry about the memories yet to be made.
I worry about the things I will forget - like weddings, graduations, first steps, birthdays and vacations.
We all tend to take them for granted.
Several years ago I went to the local card store looking for a card to send to my son Alan on Mother's Day.
I wanted to thank him for being a good son and making me the mother I was - be it good or bad!
But Hallmark hadn't caught on to that, so I expressed my feelings another way.
So as Mother's Day approaches I wanted to "remember" some things from my experience as a mother so if you'll indulge me in this I have a few things to say to my son - Dear Alan - I remember --- Reading      Curious George books to you over and over and over You      correcting me if I missed a word here and there Your      kindergarten teacher calling to tell me she didn't feel comfortable      reading a story your wrote about how babies were made because it was too real for the other children      to hear - you have your father to thank for that!
The      "marble incident" The      first time I saw you singing in a school play - I had no idea Your      "first crush" that was not reciprocated How      nervous I used to get when you were in musical theater productions.
I don't know how athletes' mothers      handle it!
That      you didn't seem embarrassed when we did a few shows together - thank you      for that opportunity How      you used "the marble incident" as the topic for an important paper "Date      night" - did I really think I was teaching you how to act on a date?
When      you got mononucleosis your freshman year in college and worried about your      grades  Telling      you about my Alzheimer's diagnosis and sharing some tears with you.
That's when you told me about meeting      Jennifer - your future wife.
You      being miffed that Yale put you on a waiting list for Law School Watching      you deliver a speech in Macon      on our family's battle with Alzheimer's Your      law school graduation from Stanford - you worked hard for that You      coming to my rescue in a New York        City subway on the way out to Flushing Meadow for      the US Open Ice      skating in Rockefeller Center, in Pentagon Row in Washington DC and in Atlanta - notwithstanding Dad's broken      elbow You      telling us that you wanted to move closer to home once you finished your      clerkship in DC Giving      you all the letters I had written you over the years on the eve of your      wedding - that was hard for both of us Of      course, the wedding You      and Jennifer buying your first house.
As I write this, I chuckle to myself at all the things you would probably remember differently - but it's Mother's Day and it's my turn!
Seriously, you and Jennifer have so many more memories to make in the years to come.
And, although I may be around in body, I'll miss many of them.
As you grow older, you'll realize how precious memories can be.
I cherish all of those I can remember now and hate that I have already lost some.
Thanks for making me the mom I am - good or bad.
Love, Mom

I received the nicest thank you not yesterday from Tamar Shovali's Psychology class.
They always send me a note after speaking to them and it is so nice that they all sign it and leave a note for me.
Thanks to Tamar for having me talk with her class and the best of luck in her new endeavors.
I also had the pleasure of speaking at the Heart of Gold Pilot Club meeting in Cleveland Georgia over the weekend.
A big thanks to all that made it possible.
I decided from now on, I'm going to take my camera and take a photo of the groups I speak to as they are always taking pictures of me.
It will be a nice reminder  for me.
My next speaking engagement starts at 6:30 a.m. -- good thing I am an early riser!
A friend of mine writes a very eloquent blog.
And, she posts every week.
I'm always amazed that she can write on the simplest of topics with such ease.
And, I realize that it might seem "easy" to her, but it sounds like it just rolled off her tongue.
I would like to think that I used to be able to do it, but not like she does.
I'm impressed -- maybe when I grow up I can be like her.
Thanks RF.
When I speak to groups, I often give them some a list of references to turn to regarding Alzheimer's.
I don't usually have this as a handout but I need to do one.
But until I do, I thought I would list some of the references here -- there are more I know -- but these are the ones currently on my power point presentation.
*Alzheimer's Association -- www.alz.org *Still Alice by Lisa Genova *The Forgetting by David Shenk *Thousand Mile Stare by Gary Reiswig *Jan's Story by Barry Petersen *Alzheimer's Early Stages by Daniel Kuhn *Learning to Speak Alzheimer's by Joanne Koenig Coste Living Your Best with Early-Stage Alzheimer's - Lisa Snyder The All-Weather Friend's Guide to Alzheimer's Disease - Mary M.

A good friend died a few weeks ago and yesterday was her memorial service.
I'm so glad that Kathy Wolfe came into my life.
She will be missed by her family and her friends.
She battled courageously for 13 years with ovarian cancer.
A fighter she was.
I worked with Kathy at the Classic Center and yesterday there was a reception there to honor her.
This photo shows some of the many people that worked with her during that time.
We will all miss her.
We had a lot of great memories with this group.
Then this past weekend my good friends Mac and Brenda Rawson took me fishing to Lake Hartwell.
Mac caught two pretty good sized spotted bass.
Brenda and I caught some sun while in the boat -- enough said.
Thanks for taking me along for the ride!

It's been awhile.
I have had a really hard time putting words down here in the past few weeks.
Just couldn't get my thoughts together.
I've tried -- but just couldn't get something published.
Since my last post -- my foot is healing well.
It will be a couple more weeks before I can really exercise, but I'm walking fine and it is feeling better every day.
I am not a runner.
Never have been, never will be.
I think it has something to do with my lung capacity or something.
Having said that, I'm going to be running in the Peachtree Road Race on the Fourth of July in Atlanta.
It is only 6.2 miles.
When I walk on the treadmill at the gym I usually walk 4 miles in an hour, so I figure if I can't run it I can probably walk it.
This is not really something ever I aspired to do, but my son and daughter-in-law live very close to where the route of the race goes.
Last year, they walked a few blocks to watch all the runners and suggested we do this together the next year (this year).
At the time, I thought it sounded like a good idea.
The Race accepts 60,000 people every year.....yes, 60,000 people.
You have to enter a lottery to get a spot.
Well, wouldn't you know that we won a spot from the lottery.
Why couldn't I have won the Georgia lottery, or the lottery for Master's tickets, or the lottery for Final Four tickets -- no I have to win the lottery for the Peachtree Road Race.
So, I'm starting to get motivated and when I can at least walk for exercise I'll gear up for running and train for the next few months.
I'll probably be the last person over the finish line, but I'll finish one way or another.
The problem I know I will have is -- the sheer number of people.
I dont do well in crowds as I have chronicled before -- but considering we will be in the back on the pack I probably won't be in much of a crowd, but one just the same.
We'll see how this all goes.
Luckily my son and daughter-in-law will be with me, or at least at the start of the race anyway!
A friend of mne passed away a few weeks ago.
She valiantly battled ovarian cancer for the last 13 years.
She was a fighter, but I know she is in a better place now.
Another friend lost his mothr this weekend and it is always hard to lose a parent.
My thoughts are with both families this weekend.
Thanks to Northridge Medical Center in Commerce Georgia for having me come to speak to their Alzheimer's 101 Class a few weeks ago.
The group was great and I enjoyed seeing everyone.
I'll be speaking in Cleveland Georgia April 27th at the Pilot Club if anyone is interested.
You can leave me a message or send me an email and I'll give you specifics.
I go to the neurologist in the morning.
Lots of things have been happening there that I'm not going into here, but we'll see how my appointment goes tomorrow.
As I mentioned earlier, I've been having trouble communicating.
A problem I am having with a friend of mine, I think stems from the problem I have in communicating.
It is hard to explain and I don't know if it is a matter of the friendship just losing its luster, or the communications problem.
I hate it, but I don't know what to do about it.
I try to work hard on keeping my friendships up, but sometimes, it is time to let go.
Maybe I have come to that point.
Hope everyone had a good Easter.

I had a good class when I went to speak this week at the UGA Psych department.
My thanks to Tamar Shovali for asking me to come to speak.
She'll be moving on to another university and I wish her the best.
Friday I had surgery on my foot.
I was suppose to have it done a couple of weeks ago but there was a scheduling problem.
I had Morton's Neuroma which is basically an inflamed nerve in my foot.
I had it almost thirty years ago in my left foot and had it removed.
It wasn't too bad.
Well, this time the damage was a little more extenisve so the operation took longer and I'm pretty sore.
So, it was worse than last time, or maybe that I am older it just seems worse.
Have to continue to stay off of it for a few days and I go back and have a new dressing put on it tomorrow.
Then, we'll see what the doctor has to say.
I'm suppose to be going to the women's SEC basketball tourney in Atlanta this week, but I guess we will to wait and see.
On another note, my sister-in-law's mother passed away yesterday.
They live in Illinois and although her mom had been in bad health for awhile, it is always sad to lose a parent.
My love to the family.

Tomorrow I have the privlege to speak to a pyschology class at UGA.
It's always interesting talking to a younger crowd about this disease.
Most have a hard time relating, but when I was diagnosed my son was a freshman in college.
So, I hope that when I do get the chance to speak to young people, they can grasp the fact that this can happen to their parents.
It's sobering, but something to understand.

I was trying to be so good, writing on this thing.
I notice that it has been almost three weeks since I've blogged and I am sorry.
The winner of the scrapbooking software is Brenda R.  Thanks to all those that commented.
Next week -- the Georgia Alzheimer's Association is having their Awareness Day at the Capitol.
I have always been able to go but this year, due to some surgery on my foot I can't make it.
But if you live in Georgia and can go -- it is next Wednesday, the 27th.
Go to www.alz.org/Georgia for more information and to register for the day.
The Statewide network of Area Councils on Aging will also be there to help put our issues in front of the legislators.
It is an interesting day and you will learn a lot.
I encourage you to go and help to promote a State Plan to Attack Alzheimer's for the state of Georgia.

When I was initially diagnosed with Alzheimer's one of the first things I did was to go through all my photographs and write on the back of them who everyone was, the date and place that it was taken.
I knew my family wouldn't remember and I knew in time that I wouldn't remember either.
After I did that (which literally took months) I decided to "scrapbook" them.
Yes, that meant making captions and cute little sayings and adding little embellishments to the pages.
It was a lot of work, but it kept my mind busy.
I still do that, but I have also had the opportunity to dive into the world of digital scrapbooking.
I wasn't sure I could learn it, but I did.
I starting using a digital scrapbooking software program call My Memories.
If I can learn how to do this, so can you.
I've used it off and on for about a year, and it does save time and your "memories" can certainly be preserved in a more secure way than all those scrapbook pages.
Last count I had over 470 actual scrapbook pages that I did by hand -- the digital version is much faster and cleaner.
I will never give up scrapbooking as we know it now, but this is a good program if you are interested in diving in.
The creators of My Memories have reached out to me and they have given me a copy of the software program to give away to one of my readers.
The site for them is MyMemories.com.
They also have a facebook page that you can like to get some ideas.
I encourage you to check it out and get a feel for it.
If you would like to win a copy of this software, just leave me a message or send me an email and I'll pick someone.
I get bombarded with people asking me to look at their products and I don't endorse them unless I'm really sold on them.
This works for me and I think it can work for you.
Give it a try -- look forward to hearing from you.

There are all kinds of "love".
We use the word all the time.
"I just love that dress!"
"Wouldn't you love to have that car?"
There's puppy love, first loves, our "only love", the love of my life......you get the picture.
When you're in a relationship for the first time, it's always tense until one person finally utters those three little words.
In my family growing up, we didn't say "I love you" very often.
I guess it was a given.
I never really gave it much thought.
We were a loving family, but those words just didn't tumble out of our mouths.
And, most of the people I knew didn't say it that often to others in their family.
Maybe because I grew up in the Midwest -- I'm not trying to stereotype here.....however, when I moved to the south over 30 years ago that is one of the things I noticed first.......how many times people said "I love you".
Because I heard it so much it didn't really seem genuine to me.
It's kind of like hearing people at the bank or the grocery saying "have a nice day", instead of just saying thank you.
You don't really hear it the same.
After moving to the South I started to give it some more thought.
My first thought was, do people really think I don't love them because I don't say it very often?
Will they really hear what I am saying when I say it?
My husband is very quiet and reserved and for him to say those three little words is something short of a miracle, so I don't push it.
But when I had my son I couldn't say it enough -- and I was certain that was something I wanted him to say frequently.
I think I got him to say that more than "Yes ma'am and No Ma'am" which is sacred in the south as well.
But at least I love you worked on him even if I couldn't make the Yes ma'am No ma'am thing stick.
(As you can see I'm shooting 50% here with husband and son) I've become more comfortable with telling people I know how important they are to me and yes, that I even love them.
I used to think that that was just for those in our immediate family who we were almost bonded to love because they were a part of us.
It took me a long time to realize that my friends that are important to me are worthy of the "I love you" phrase and it should be said more often.
Over the holidays a very long time friend (who also happens to be a native northerner) said "I Love You" to me and I was so taken by it I didn't know how to respond.
Isn't that an interesting response after thinking I had actually broken that barrier.
I was proud of myself for also saying those three little words before we parted.
It made me feel good.
And, this week, I received a very touching email from a friend and she signed it "I love you".
And, even though we have exchanged those words to each other frequently it still moved me.
Don't wait....tell someone you love them.....you'll never know how that will lift someone's mood.

Many of you have asked about the Advocacy Day at the Capitol in Atlanta this year.
This year, it is February 27th.
One of the things that we are advocating for is a state plan for dealing with Alzheimer's.
If you live in the state of Georgia, please read below -- this is something that was put out by the Alzheimer's Association of Georgia and how you can help.
If you have any questions at all, there is an 800 number at the bottom you can call.
Thanks for reading this and helping to get this passed.
The  Alzheimer's Association, Georgia Chapter Applauds Senator Renee Unterman's  Pre-filing Senate Bill 14, Creating the Georgia Alzheimer's and Related  Dementias State Plan Task Force On Thursday, December 20, Senator Renee  Unterman held a press conference at the Georgia State Capitol.
Senator Unterman  stated that the purpose of the press conference was "...the introduction of the  legislation creating a state wide task force establishment to assess the current  and future impact of Alzheimer's disease in the state of Georgia.
It will  examine the existing industries, services, and resources addressing the needs of  Georgians afflicted with the disease and its effect on their families.
It will  develop a strategy to mobilize a state response to this public health  crisis." "...Georgia must be prepared with an active plan to share  the burden of taking care of its citizens who are likely to require government  assistance in the final stages of their lives due to the effects of dementia.
Whether those services are provided in-home, community based, or in a nursing  home type facility, Georgia must be ready to improve its health care  infrastructure.
I  challenge the Departments of Human Services and Aging, the Department of Public  Health, the Executive branch and General Assembly to actively participate in  developing this plan by approving this legislation." The bill creates the Georgia Alzheimer's  and Related Dementias State Plan Task Force, for the purpose of: Studying and collecting information and data to assess  the current and future impact of Alzheimer's disease on Georgia's citizens;  To examine the existing  industries, services, and resources addressing the needs of persons with  Alzheimer's disease, their families, and caregivers;  To review the National Plan to  Address Alzheimer's Disease; and  To develop a strategy to  mobilize a state response to Alzheimer's and related dementias as a public  health crisis by creating a state plan.
The  proposed State Plan Task force will be chaired by the director of the Division  of Aging Services, and includes the Commissioner of Community Health or his or  her designee, the State Health Officer or his or her designee, the Chairperson  of the House Committee on Health and Human Services, the Chairperson of the  Senate Health and Human Services Committee, and the Chairperson of the House  Committee on Human Relations and Aging.
The Task Force shall invite other  advisory members to assist the committee and may consider the following in  making its selection.
This membership includes individuals with Alzheimer's and  a related dementia and their caregivers, members of the various care services  industries, a medical provider, a researcher, law enforcement personnel, and  members from the public, private and non-profit sectors, voluntary health  organizations, and the faith-based community.
At a  minimum, the State Plan shall include the following: Trends in state Alzheimer's  and related dementias population and needs, including the changing population  with dementia;  Existing services, resources,  and capacity;  Needed state policies or  responses, including but not limited to directions for the provision of clear  and coordinate services and support to persons and families living with  Alzheimer's disease and related disorders and strategies to address any  identified gaps in services;  Ways in which state and local  agencies, private sector, quasi-governmental, voluntary health organizations,  the faith community and nonprofit organizations can collaborate and work  together to form a seamless network of education, support, and other needed  services to those living with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias and  their families;  A review of, at a minimum,  eighteen specific areas of concern.
The  task force shall issue a state plan which shall include proposed legislation, if  any, to the Governor and General Assembly on or before March 31, 2014.
Upon  abolishment of the task force, the Georgia Alzheimer's and Related Dementias  Advisory Council shall be created, with the same membership as the original  State Plan Task Force.
The Advisory Council shall meet at least annually to  review the progress of the State Plan and to make any recommendations for  changes as well as to recommend any legislation needed to implement the  Plan.

Happy New Year from our Family to Yours I've been doing this for about 8 years.
When I went back and look at my history of my posts it averages out to about one post every two weeks.
I was much better in the beginning -- I guess that is how we are sometimes with our new year's resolutions ---- good in the beginning and then we falter.
I'm going to try to stay more on target this year -- with at least a post a week.
I read other people's blogs all the time and I'm jealous of the work they put into it -- it's not as easy at it looks, or at least it isn't for me anymore.
But stay with me -- I'll be back soon!

I wouldn't say that I "love" Christmas like lots of people do.
I usually get a little down during the holiday season and don't really know why.
I guess I don't like the expectation of everyone thinking you should be happy for the holiday season when in fact you should try to be happy all the time!
But what I do like about the holidays is the receiving of holiday cards.
If you know me, you know I like to receive cards, make cards and send cards.
So many people don't send holiday cards anymore and that is a shame to me.
But those that do, I love getting them, and I say thank you.
Even if there isn't a holiday letter inside explaining to me what everyone has been up to I still enjoy them.
I thank the Lord I have friends that still remember me and take the time to send that holiday greeting.
And, I love reading all the letters -- I know a lot of people make fun of them, but I do enjoy reading about all the wonderful things people are doing and the love they are sharing.
Our family didn't have a lot of "traditions" at the holiday time when I grew up except maybe two that I remember.
My father was a pressman for the Peoria Journal Star (PJS), the daily newspaper in Peoria Illinois where I grew up.
He always worked nights.
But Christmas Day was the only day of the year, the PJS didn't publish.
So, my dad would always have Christmas Eve off from work.
We knew he would always be home that night.
In fact, my mother and father were married on Christmas Eve because of that very fact.
At the time, he was an apprentice and didn't get much time off at all, so they knew they were safe in planning a Christmas Eve wedding and that his friends from the newspaper could be at the wedding.
Every year on Christmas Eve, it seemed as if everyone we knew came by the house and "celebrated" my parent's anniversary and Christmas Eve.
I don't know how it started, but every year, we could always count on seeing our friends, neighbors and relatives that one time of the year.
No one was sent invitations, everyone just showed up.
My mom always had lots of food and everyone brought their homemade goodies to share with everyone.
I don't remember my mom working for days getting things prepared......it just happened.
I'm sure she did, but don't they say that the sign of a good party is when it looks effortless?
Another tradition that we had involved my dad.
He was an orphan growing up.
His mother had some problems in child birth after one of his siblings was born and could no longer care for my dad and his siblings.
They were put in an orphanage and all of the children were adopted out to different families except one who ended up staying in the orphanage until she was a young adult.
The family that adopted my family didn't end up raising him as he ran away and headed up to Illinois (he was born in the south).
In adulthood, he ended up finding a sister and a brother and was able to actually reunite with his birth mother before she died.
But, having grown up an orphan he didn't exactly have many traditional Christmases.
He never asked for a lot, but he loved opening presents.
So, we would wrap everything and anything for my dad to unwrap on Christmas day.
He was a big fisherman so we would end up wrapping individual little hooks and fishing flys just so he would have a lot to open up.
It sounds silly, but he enjoyed opening all the presents as much as we enjoyed seeing him smile.
My dad died the year before my son was born.
One of my biggest regrets in life is not having Alan sooner so my dad could have met him.
They would have been buddies.
Life's short.
Make your own traditions with your family and cherish the moments you have together.
The tragedy that unfolded recently in Connecticut should bring that home to everyone.

This week I got to spend some one on one time with my beautiful daughter-in-law Jennifer Lee.
We went to see "The Cake Boss", at the Cobb Energy Center in Atlanta.
He gave us some cake decorating tips as well as shared his humor with us.
I had a great time spending time with Jen and having a girls night out.
Thanks for going with me Jennifer!

It's a time to be grateful and I have a lot to be grateful for.
Thanks to my friends for sticking with me for the person that I have become.
I don't know what I would be without my friends and family.
We have so many material things that we sometimes overlook the most precious gift of all -- love and support.
My family growing up wasn't the most functional of families so holidays were many times not the happiest times.
Thankfully, our small family hasn't gotten to that point and hopefully never will.
I'm grateful that Alan and Jen have moved back to the area and we can see each other more frequently.
What are you grateful for this Thanksgiving?

I promise I am not MIA.
I have had so many thoughts lately -- was going to sit down and write about them and as quickly as I thought about them, they left me.
I even wrote some of them down, and then couldn't find where I had written them.
November has been busy and I've been trying to keep up, but it's amazing to me how much gets by me these days.
I'm slowing down and everything else speeds up -- or at last that is what it seems like to me.
The holidays are fast approaching and I feel like a deer in the headlights.
I'm anxious in a bad way and can't really figure out why.
Hopefully, by the time I do, the feeling will be gone.

I've written about my friend Lisa Genova before.
She is the author of the above named books.
I first met Lisa a few years ago when she wrote Still Alice -- about a young woman that had younger on-set Alzheimer's (YOAD).
A friend of mine also with younger on-set told me I needed to read the book as the lives of people with YOAD are widely misunderstood.
Through him, I got to know Lisa.
In February of 2010 I met Lisa for the first time in Savannah.
She had just finished Left Neglected and was starting to work on Love Anthony.
She told me that Love Athony was about autism.
She was explaining to me how she was handling the subject and I couldn't quite get into my head how it was going to work.
A few weeks ago, Love Anthony came out.
I bought it but didn't pick it up until this weekend.
When I picked it up, I couldn't put it down.
Without ruining the story or the ending for you, I wanted to say that Lisa has nailed this just like in her other two books.
The story involves two women whose lives are paralleled throughout the book, with them coming together at the end.
One woman writes a book about autism, the other woman has a son that has autism.
When they meet, the woman who has the son tells the other woman that she has written the story of her son's life.
This was such a poignant moment for me, because when I read Still Alice, I said out loud to no one, "this is the story of my life".
I couldn't believe that she had captured this so eloquently and so on target.
So, when I read this in this book I thought it was very ironic for me.
And, Lisa also gives a shout out to Athens, GA -- which certainly brought a smile to my face.
I know I wrote about Left Neglected when it came out as well.
It's about a neurological condition called Left Neglect.
I had never heard of it and it just fascinated me when I read the book.
If you want a good read, please go get Love, Anthony.
You will not be disappointed -- oh, and bring some tissues because you are going to need them.

As you can see, I was in Arizona last week.
Finally got to take the Grand Canyon off my bucket list.
Also visited Sedona Arizona as well.
What a beautiful state.
The bottom photo is my childhood friend, Jan Mangis Thomas.
Jan and I grew up together in Bartonville Illinois.
We went to elementary school and high school together.
Jan has done a much better job of keeping up with everyone we went to school with than I have so it was nice to hear what everyone was doing!
Jan and her husband moved to Arizona a few years before I moved to Georgia.
We've known each other over 50 years and haven't seen each other in 40.
What a nice reunion at the end of a great trip.
Thanks to Jan and JP for dinner and old times!!

For the past four days I've been in Arizona.
Yep, one more thing to check off the bucket list.
Earlier this week I went to see the Grand Canyon.
I can't describe it, pictures don't do it justice.
I was overwhelmed by the size of it.
A mere person seems so insignificant when you see such a "wonder of the world".
Now I am in Sedona -- home of the Red Rocks.
I didn't quite expect this -- I expected this type of view in Colorado, not Arizona.
I also have always wanted to go to the Red Rocks Amphitheatre in Colorada -- a natural amphitheatre made of the beautiful Red Rock.
I've just had a few hours to look at Sedona but expect to do much more today.
Then, tomorow, I am catching up with an old childhood friend.
We went to elementary school and high school together.
A few years ago we caught up with each other on Facebook and have been staying in touch ever since.
She lives right outside of Phoenix and tomorrow we will be together for the first time in close to 40 years.
I'm anxious to see her.
Some friendships never die.....they just stay dormant for awhile and then will erupt when we make it possible.
Why don't you take a few minutes and reconnect with someone -- whether it be over the phone, through the internet or by a hand written note -- isn't that a novel idea these days?

This past week, I had the good fortune to see a group of ladies that I have not seen in a long time.
Years ago we used to play tennis together and we were able to get 12 of us together to have lunch.
It was great to catch up and to see everyone again.
I wish we wouldn't have waited so long.
It's finally started to cool down some in the south and it's finally nice to be outside.
Now, if I only had that screened in porch I've always wanted.......

is tomorrow, September 21st.
Join me in wearing purple for the cause!
I know it has been awhile since I last blogged.
I've been busy.
Over the course of the last 10 days I have given 7 different talks to groups around Atlanta and Athens.
Today was my last one until October 9th.
So, I am resting tonight.
Today's talk wasn't as good as I would have liked it to be -- I was pretty tired going in and I know that affected it.
But thanks to all who had me come and speak.
I really enjoyed meeting everyone, getting to go to new places and found some new friends.
What can be better than that?

Those "foggy days" keep coming.
It's bad because I never really know when to expect them.
Last week, I went to go play golf with my husband.
On the way to the golf course I couldn't remember where we were going.
I didn't say anything at the time, because I knew that eventually we would get somewhere, right?
I did realize we were at a golf course though when we arrived.
My husband paid and my husband handed me the scorecard since I'm always the one that keeps score -- or at least I try.
I couldn't figure out where to put our names on the scorecard.
I kept having to ask my husband "how this thing worked".
He helped me through it.
Once we were on the golf course, it wasn't very good.
I couldn't concentrate, had to ask my husband what club to use.
I couldn't keep track of the way the game was going.
Needless to say, I had a very high score that day!
But today, we went golfing again and things were much better === my score wasn't that much better, but my day wasn't so foggy!
I guess I should be grateful I can still walk the course and enjoy the exercise.

My friends, the Comptons, took pity on me and took me fishing yesterday!
I was so excited to be going.
As you can see I caught a fish -- more than one actually -- this is small but there were some keepers.
I can't thank them enough for inviting me to go along.
I was going to call Joe Compton my "fishing fairy godfather" but I didn't think he would like that -- so let's just say he was a great captain of the boat (the boat has no name by the way) and a great sport to take me along.
I promised Suzanne I wouldn't post any photos of her -- so here is Joe and my catch!
Thanks again.

I have to laugh at myself sometimes.
I "tried" to go fishing last week.
I think I have mentioned here that I wanted to go fishing as I used to fish with my dad years and years ago.
So, I wanted to do it again -- I guess in his honor -- I don't know.
My son bought me a new rod and reel for Mother's Day so I was all excited to give it a go.
My husband loathes fishing so I was all set to do this by myself.
Well, I am not going to go into the gory details, let me just say that it was pretty much a disaster.
First of all, I don't have a boat.
So, I called around to several area state parks and were told they had fishing boats to rent.
After finally getting all my gear ready I trekked off to the lake.
The john boat I was renting was extremely heavy, the boat did not have oar locks on it so how is one person suppose to paddle a john boat?
Of course, there was no anchor and it just kept getting worse.
Like I said I am not going to go into all the gory details, other than to say I'm going to try to again -- but with a new strategy.
I will prevail over this....one way or another.
Or I'll find someone to take pity on me and actually take me with them!!!
But I will conquer it!

Father's Day in Atlanta with Jen and AlanHere is a photo of Alan and Jen with the dads, and then with the moms.They just bought a new house in Atlanta.
we went over yesterday to see the house for the first time.
We had seen the outside, but they just closed this week so they just got the keys.
The photos I'm posting here are from the posting of the house when it was for sale.
It's a beautiful house and I know they will enjoy fixing it up and making it a home.I have always wanted a screened in back porch -- so their screened in porch is where I am going to be most of the time when I visit!The previous owners had a baby grand piano, but Jen's mom and dad have a baby grand piano they are giving Alan and Jen so I would think it may go in the same place.I attempted to make a cake that "looked" like their house --it wasn't great, but it wasn't good enough to show here but it served the purpose long enough for us to cut into it.

I've just returned from Illinois visiting family.
Alan hadn't been in four years so we made a quick visit over Mother's Day and it was great to see everyone.
All my great nieces and nephews are growing and I got to meet my best friend Pody's little grand daughter Jane for the first time.
Jane was one year old in March.
They just happened to be in the area over the weekend so I was so glad to meet her.
This is my niece Nicola and my great niece Dakota.
This is my great nephew Oliver with Alan and I.
This is my great nephew Henry -- isn't that hair fabulous?
And, this is Jane with her family -- dad Mark, mom Rachel, Alan granddad Rick, Grandma Pody and me.
And, Alan and I went with my brother and sister in law to a minor league baseball game while in Peoria -- the Peoria Chiefs.
It would not be a proper visit with Alan anywhere to not go to a baseball game!

For about the last year, I have been thinking about going fishing.
That probably sounds funny to most of you.
But, when I was young, my father pretty much fished every day of his life.
He would work the night shift as a pressman for the daily newspaper, come home, eat breakfast, go fishing and then take a nap.
He'd get up from his nap, eat dinner and go to work.
I loved going fishing with my dad because it was about the only time I saw him and it was alone time with him.
We would always get in an argument because my dad would be trolling the boat and if he caught a fish while trolling we would stop, put down anchor and fish there for awhile.
If I caught a fish while trolling he wouldn't stop but go somewhere else to fish.
We used to laugh about this all the time.
My dad died about 29 years ago.
My big regret has always been that I had not had my son when my father died.
My dad would have loved Alan.
I see a lot of my dad in Alan and that makes me proud.
I miss my dad.
My mom and I weren't that close and I guess dads and daughters are.
After my dad died I took one of his fishing rods and have it mounted in my living room.
It's a constant reminder of that constant person in my life.
I haven't been fishing in over 30 years and the more I think about my dad the more I want to go fishing.
My brother visited about a month ago and he made the comment he wanted to go fishing.
I was so surprised he said that because I hadn't told him what I was thinking, and he wasn't the first one to volunteer to go fishing with dad.
He would go on occasion, but he certainly wasn't the first one in the boat.
And, I don't remember him cleaning fish with dad and I.
He probably did, but I don't remember that.
So, we had this conversation while he was here about fishing and I needed to buy a rod and reel because one way or another this summer I am going fishing.
I've said a few things to friends about wanting to go fishing and although they fish on a regular basis I haven't been given an invitation to go with them -- so I'll do it on my own.
And, maybe I'll even catch enough for my dinner.

Last night there was a dinner to give out awards and as you can see Coach Summitt and her son were there to receive an award handed out by Maria Shriver.
Meredith Viera was the guest host and Jane Seymour was also on hand.
Today we are heading to Capitol Hill to talk with our legislators about increased funding and support for Alzheimer's legislation.

<doc date=Tuesday, April 24, 2012>
I'm in the nation's capital this week for the annual Alzheimer's Association Advocacy Forum.
There are over 700 people here representing all fifty states and the District of Columbia.
Yesterday, I had a meeting with others with Early stage Alzheimer's and got to meet some new friends.
Some had ties to Atlanta in one way or another and I hope our paths will cross again.
Many at the meeting were there for the first time and I think it helped them to see so many of us "like them".
Today we have a long day.
Breakfast starts at 6:45 with our first meeting at 7:30 and our last event starting tonight at 7:30 p.m.  A visit to Congressman John Lewis' office is scheduled for this afternoon and tomorrow we will be going to the Hill for meetings with our other legislators from Georgia to ask for their help on a variety of issues.
It will be a long two days but worth it.
I'll try to post some photos tomorrow.

This blogspot that I am using keeps changing on me and I always get a different screen while trying to post.
I need someone to help me with it or I'm not going to be able to post any longer because it is too confusing.
So, I might be absent for awhile but I'm going to keep trying.
Next week I'm heading to Washington DC for the annual Alzheimer's Advocacy Conference.
I'm anxious to see old friends and to see what we are facing in the year to come with Alzheimer's funding as well as research is taking us.
Hopefully, there will be some good news on the horizon.
In my last post, I spoke of some funerals that I had recently gone too.
Unfortunately, since then another person I know had his life cut short this past week.
A brain aneurysm took the life of a vibrant man in his 40's.
A friend to everyone he met, he leaves and beautiful wife.
Oh so sudden, and oh so sad.
My heart goes out to Amy for her loss and to all of us who knew Jon.
The love they showed for each other was to be envied.
You will be missed Jon -- may your rest in peace.
Having said that -- I keep going back to how short life is.
Even if we live to a ripe old age are we doing everything we can to make it a happy life?
We need to, and while I think that -- I wish I was strong enough to take my own advice.
But, sometimes, that is hard to do isn't it?

<doc date=Monday, April 09, 2012>
This post is going to be long and it is going to jump around a lot, so hang in there with me.
I've been making notes about some of the things I wanted to write about and the topics are all over the place.
I can't come up with a way to string them all together, so I'll try to at least group my thoughts.
This is one of those instances where I can't get everything to flow smoothly in my brain, so I'm doing the best I can today.
Most of the time I just put it off because I can't get it to come out like I want -- but this time I'm going for it!I've been to two funerals in the past three weeks.
Both lives cut way too short.
The services were unique in their own way.
But both services brought home to me that there is never enough time to be with your family and friends.
One minister said "Death ends a life, not a relationship".
But when I think of Alzheimer's I think just the opposite -- Alzheimer's ends a relationship, not a life.
As the disease progresses it is harder and harder to have a "normal" relationship with those you love.
It's constantly changing and much sooner than you would like -- the relationship becomes one sided with those afflicted inching away.
I guess that is why I've always said "I have the easy part".The last funeral I attened was for a friend that had a terminal illness and knew she was dying.
She had given her pastor instructions on what she wanted her memorial service to be like -- the hymns to be sung, the prayers to be said.
As I was sitting there I couldn't help but think of my own family.
We've talked about what we want to happen to us when we die but never about any type of service.
After this particular service I was laughing with some friends about the fact that when I die no one will probably know.
They asked me why and I told them that these days it costs money to put an obituary in the paper and anyone who knows my husband knows that he would never spend money like that!
So, I've told them if they don't hear from me one way or another for a month or so they might want to check!
In all seriousness, I'm going to give it some thought and try to steer my family in the right direction anyway.
We've given a lot of other things thought.
We've gotten all of our legal "stuff" worked out.
And, as bad as this may sound to you, I've even selected photos and items I would like to have in my room if and when the time comes to place me in a home.
I have to believe that if some things are important to me now that they will be then.
Although I won't be able to communicate it.Friends -- I've talked a lot about firends and alzheimr's.
How it was difficult for some of my friends after I was first diagnosed.
Many just walked away.
Some have retured and others have not.
That's o.k.
I'm meeting new friends and at this stage of my life I'm kind of surprised by that.
You usully think of friends as being those life long friends from elementary, high school or college.
But since I've been out of school for so long and live far away from my home town, I suppose its only right that my friends are somewhat local and easy to find time to visit with.
My new friends intrigue me because some are much younger and some I have met by happenstance.It saddens me that several of my friendships I thought were pretty solid have gone by the wayside.
I've tried to reach out to them on numerous occasions with no response.
I would really like to know what happeneed.
If I did something wrong I want to apologize even if the friendship is beyond repair.
I want to know because I don't want to make the same mistake with others.
It's o.k.
if they don't want to be friends any longer -- I'd just like to know why.
The thing that probably gets to me the most is I didn't see it coming.
Sometimes you do.
Sometimes you just drift apart.
I didn't realize there was a problem with these friends.
I hope some day I'll know and I hope in some way some of these people will work themselves back into my life -- before I can't remember them.Major meltdown -- A few weeks ago I was out at our local Target store.
I hadn't been in there for awhile and it looked as if they were in the middle of a makeover.
At first it didn't bother me, but after about fifteen minutes in the store and a cart half full -- I started to panic.
I didn't know where things were, everything looked different and I just got disoriented.
I literally froze in place.
I knew I needed some help.
My husband was out playing tennis so I couldn't call him.
I checked my phone for my one number dialing and everyone on there didn't live in Athens (I have since changed my dialing numbers).
Finally someone who knew me walked by and realized I was having some problems.
I just needed to get out of the building and she helped me.
I haven't been back since.
After telling this story to several people they all asked me the same thing.
When you are traveling and go into a store that is unfamiliar to you how does that affect you?
My answer probably doesn't make a lot of sense to them -- but usually I am with someone and I'm not expecting merchandise to be in a certain place or on a certain shelf.
The things that catch me off guard seems to be a trigger point for me.Money -- You would think by now I would just stop trying to make change.
But every now and then I try to test myself on it -- it's simple right?
A few days ago I was buying something and it came to a total of $26.10.
It took me awhile to get the $26 counted out.
I was so proud of myself.
Then came the $.10.
Although I could hear the clerk tell me I was ten cents short, I couldn't physically take the dime out of my wallet.
I knew what I was suppose to do -- but the whole process couldn't make it from my brain to my fingers.
This is just so frustrating -- I need to just stop testing myself.
By the way -- I asked the clerk if he minded just taking the dime out of my wallet.
Yes, he looked at me pretty strange and he did it....but hey....welcome to my world.

First of all, if you haven't seen the new "Facts and Figures" out for Alzheimer's I hope you'll take a minute and visit www.alz.org.
The new information is pretty staggering over just a year ago.
It shows how much more work we all have to do.This morning I was hit by a car -- not my car -- me!
A lady hit me at a local grocery store parking lot and sent me into another car.
Nothing broken, just sore tonight and I'm sure I'll have some bruises to show for it.
But, the lady drove off!
I know she had to know she hit me.
There was a man there who helped me and by the time I got my brain in gear, she had gone and we didn't get her license plate.
Then this afternoon I attempted to play golf.
That wasn't a good idea -- let's just say that I had a nice walk on a beautiful day.Tomorrow will be better.
I get to have lunch with some friends and their six month old little girl.
I haven't seen her in a couple of months and I can't wait to hold her.

I have heard lately from several people who have come to realize how important their parents are.
Taken their parents for granted all these years.
I don't think I realized it until I became a parent myself.
But, in the reverse, I hope that I don't take my son for granted -- I probably do but don't think about it.
I do appreciate when he calls me out of the blue or sends me an email without wanting something.
He's always been pretty good about that -- I am thankful for that.
I don't tell him often enough how much that means to me and I should.
We shouldn't wait to tell any of our friends or family how much they mean to us.
Don't take it for granted.
Be proactive.
Appreciate everyone you know-- they all have a part in your life, whether a major one or not.

I grew up in and around Peoria Illinois.
Yes, it is always the butt of many jokes, but it is also the world headquarters of Caterpillar Tractor Company -- known now as only Caterpillar.
Having said that it was interesting growing up in a "one company" town if you will.
If you weren't associated with "CAT" you didn't exist.
I remember once wanting to see a doctor and not being able to get in because I din't work for Cat.
I had my secretary (whose husband did work for Cat) call and make an appointment for herself and then I went.
I had to beg them to take me and they would only take cash money.
I had good insurance but they didn't want to deal with it.
I was lucky they even saw me at all.Then over 30 years ago I got married and we moved to Athens Georgia -- where the single employer here is the University of Georgia.
If you weren't associated with UGA you didn't exist.
I can honestly say that over the years that has changed and you don't feel quite as alienated as you used to -- or at least we don't.But now, Caterpillar announced today they are opening a plant here in Athens that will employ around 1,000 people.
It's great for the community, but how ironic is that?

at the Georgia Capitol was yesterday.
Over 300 people were in Atlanta to help advocate for some issues that our legislature is dealing with regarding Alzheimer's.
Just a few years ago when this even was started there were a hand full of people there.
I was so proud of our contingency from all over the state that came.
Everyone has their own unique story.
And, after yesterday, I know that even when I cannot speak for myself, there will be a host of people out there advocating for me.Thanks to my family for coming and taking time out of their work days -- as well as my daughter-in-law's father.
That meant so much to me.
I appreciate everyone's support.I have lots to write about the visit and will do so when I get some photos to post from yesterday.Thanks to the Alzheimer's Association of Georgia for hosting us and helping us with our visits.

The president is working on the budget and we need to be sure that he stays committed to NAPA.
Here is something from the Alzheimer's Association website -- if you clink on the link below you can sign the letter going to President Obama.
It only takes a minute and we need your help.Alzheimer's can't wait.
We need a federal commitment in order to change the course of Alzheimer's disease.
Tell President Obama millions of families are counting on him to fulfill the potential of the National Alzheimer's Project Act when he releases his upcoming Budget Request to Congress.http://www.alz.org/petition/overview.asp?type=homepage_petition

On Monday, February 13th -- you'll find me at the Georgia State Capitol to help promote Alzheimer's Awareness to our legislators.
Will you join me?
Many people are intimidated to go to the "gold dome" as we often call our capitol.
They are intimidated by not knowing the process of talking to our legislators and afraid of saying the wrong thing.
The great day about the Awareness Day at the Capitol is that if you feel uncomfortable talking, you don't have to -- you just need to be there.
There will be others willing to talk on your behalf, but you showing up and adding to our numbers makes a difference.
When legislators see the "sea of purple" (since you'll be given purple shirts to wear" it makes a big impact on them.
We want to make legislators aware that Alzheimer's isn't going to go away any time soon, and we need their help.The Georgia Alzheimer's office is currently working on several initiatives that we want our legistlators to know about.
Items that will affect not only those living with the disease but certainly the hundreds of caregivers in Georgia.
One of those things is a state Alzheimer's Plan.
Currently, 19 states have state Alzheimer's plans.
These plans help to guide how Alzheimer's is handled on a state basis and will work in conjunction with the National Alzheimer's Project Act that is currently being formed on a national level.
The state plan can deal with all types of issues facing those dealing with Alzheimer's to help with respite care, programs and services and laws that protect our loved ones with Alzheimer's.Many initiatives need funding -- and although we know funding is in short supply these days, if we don't stay out in front of our legislators, then we will be forgotten.
If you've never done anything like this before, please consider joining us.
As a favor to me, and the other 200,000 people living with Alzheimer's in the state of Georgia.
Numbers count.
And we need you to help make a difference.
Just your presence is something.
Don't be intimidated -- you won't have to do anything you aren't comfortable with.
But, if you are reading this blog, you probably have someone in your life you know with Alzheimer's and you can help us just by showing up on Feburary 13th.
The day will start with lunch, then a walk to the capitol to meet with legislators and possibly the governor and end with dinner and a candlelight tribute on the steps of the capitol.
You can come for all or part of it.
I can't stress enough what an impact seeing hundreds of people wearing purple shirts in the capitol makes.You must register -- but it is simple and can be done online.
There is also training if you so desire to learn about the iniatives that are going to be discussed.
You can do that in person or online if you so choose.
We just need to know if you are coming or not so we can plan for food and shirts for everyone.
You can read more about here: http://act.alz.org/site/PageNavigator/georgiaadvocacy.html1Please make Alzheimer's a priority -- we need everyone's help!

This week the National Alzheimer's Project Act was discussed in Washington DC.
This is one of the first of many meetings to bring this act to fruition.
An article ran in the USA Today regarding the act and the work that is being done on it.You can read it here : http://yourlife.usatoday.com/health/medical/alzheimers/story/2012-01-16/US-launches-national-war-on-Alzheimers/52603476/1

I've written about my friend Lisa Genova, author of Still Alice and Left Neglected.
January 20 is a big day for her -- she will be appearing on the Today Show that morning, she will be on Dr. Oz show that day and then that night she is part of a documentary on younger on-set Alzhiemer's.The documentary is "To Not Fade Away".
It is on at 10:00 p.m. January 20.
The bad part for me at least is, that it is airing on RLTV.
RLTV is a network aimed at the "over 50" age group and stands for "Redefine Life".
However, it is not in my area.
To see if you get RLTV on your cable system, you can go to their website at http://rl.tv/ an put your zip code in.
That will tell you whether or not you receive that channel and where to find it.Thanks to Lisa for all she does for our Alzheimer's community.
She's working on a new book and I'll tell you more about that at another time.

I've had lots of comments lately.
Many -- I'm not posting here.
I'm glad the last post received some comments though -- and to one I too am sad this had to happen to Coach Summitt -- or anyone.It's just Tuesday and this has already been a bad week.
Seems like I set out to do one thing and it doesn't go my way and the rest of the day goes down hill from there.
I'm frustrating myself by not being able to do some things and that makes me mad.
Learning new things is difficult and I get frustrated so easily.
I think "this can't be that hard" and it isn't really -- I just can't grasp it.
It is so maddening!!!
And, if I do "get it" the answer to it was in front of my nose the whole time and although I could see it and read it -- I couldn't figure out what it was telling me.
That disconnect in the brain can play lots of weird tricks on you!

The Southeastern Conference has posted on their site that there will be a "We Back Pat Week" in honor of Pat Summitt, University of Tennessee women's basketball coach who was recently diagnosed with younger on-set Alzheimer's.
Thanks to the SEC and the basketball nation for recognizing her courageous stance to bring public awareness to this disease.

Happy New Year Everyone!I was pretty disappointed in my lack of posts at the end of the year.
I really wanted to do better.
I would wake up in the middle of the night with the best ideas, plan it all out in my head and by morning, it was gone.
I'm sure you're saying, why didn't you get up and write it down.
I've tried that before, and when I do, I can't go back to sleep.
So, I am giving up ideas for sleep is what it sounds like!
Since my sleep is often given up to hot flashes (or "power surges" as one friend calls it) I don't like to give up much more!
I was overwhelmed with our trip to Australia, and quite frankly it took a lot to get back to normal after that trip.
It pretty much took the wind out of my sails if you will.
But, it was worth every minute -- it just came at a bad time of the year, but it was the only time we could go and did I mention IT WAS WORTH IT?I don't usually do the traditional resolution thing at the new year.
Why should you have to wait for a new year to make a change?
If you need to make a change, you need to make a change.
I'm not sure I'm up to "changing" things this year, that probably isn't within my power -- or at least the things I would like to change are not.
But, I need to be better about some things.
....but don't we all.I want to be a better friend.
I don't want to keep saying "we shouldn't wait so long to get together" -- I just need to make it happen.
A few of my friends have kind of gone by the wayside this past year.
That saddens me some.
I wonder why that is.
Do our friendships run in cycles?
Do we just not work hard enough at it?
Is it maybe the friendship wasn't meant to be?
Has the friendship run its course?
Am I to blame?
I get the feeling people don't want to be around me as much anymore.
That's kind of hard to come to terms with but what bothers me more is not knowing.
If those that choose not to be friends any longer would just admit it or bring it to a close, rather than leaving that faint hint of welcome in their voice it would be so much better.
I know that is hard to do, but I'd rather just know why it is the friendship has ended.
We have invested a lot of time over the years and to just let something go without paying attention to it is sad.
I don't know what else to say about that.Another thing I want to work on is to be better to myself.
I need to pace myself better.
I need to let things go more easily.
It's hard to admit you can't do something that you could do all your life -- I just need to let go!
I'd like to do more public speaking on behalf of Azlheimer's so if there is a group you think I could talk to -- let me know.
I'm grateful for a lot last year.
My family's health has stayed about the same (not gotten worse thankfully), there have been many new babies born to bring a smile to my face, my son and daughter-in-law have moved "back home", I got a new knee and lots of help from friends when I was going through that ordeal.
I read Dr. Mary Cail's book, The All-Weather Friend's Guide to Alzheimer's Disease and everyone dealing with someone with Alzheimer's should read it.
I've stayed active on Alzheimer's Association's boards.
Our Walk to End Alzheimer's reached its targeted goal of $75,000 raised.
And, of course, the aforementioned "trip".
The bucket list got a little shorter this year, but I'm thinking of adding more things to it.
There really can be no end to your bucket list if you really think about it -- there is always something you want to do.
I've been very fortunate all in all.
I'm still pretty active physically even though not as much mentally -- but I'm hanging in there.
Thanks for all your support.
I'm going to try to be better about blogging in this new year.

Carter and Ruby meet for the first time.Katie, Chris, Carter, Melissa, Josh, Ruby, me and Alan Yesterday -- I was able to catch up with some of my favorite people.......my friend Josh and his wife Melissa and Chris and his wife Katie.
If you have been following this blog you will know about my friendship with Josh and Chris.
Well, this year, they both had an addition to their families.
Chris and Katie welcomed son Carter on August 20 and Josh and Melissa welcome daughter Ruby on September 10th.
Chris and Katie live in Southern Florida so yesterday was the first time we have been able to meet Carter.
The photo above shows all of us together.
It was fun having everhone together -- they are extended family to me and I am so grateful to them continuing to stay in touch with me and being apart of their lives.

Jennifer and Alan were kind enough to invite us for dinner with Jen's parents.
Nice to be a guest for a change!
Thanks Alan and Jennifer!
Relaxing after Thanksgiving DinnerJen and her mom enjoying the food.
Alan after dinnerAlan and I sharing the swing at the park behind their apartment after dinner.I love to swing -- although only kids were suppose to be on the swings I couldn't resist!
If I hadn't had a dress on I would have been in the middle of this!
Of course, everyone cleaned their plate!
Lots of good food made by Jen and Alan Going through our Australian scrapbook with Jennifer's parents.
Alan found this wine in Atlanta -- from Australia -- and the little island where we saw the "Little Penguins".
Jen didn't have to call us twice to the dinner table!

In today's edition of the Atlanta Journal Consitution, the first articles of several about Alzheimer's is published.
The link is here http://www.ajc.com/health/slow-descent-into-the-1224104.html.
There will be more articles in the weeks to come.
Thought you might want to take a look.

<doc date=Tuesday, November 01, 2011>
is a book you must get if you are a friend or caregiver to someone with Alzheimer's.
This book is a real "hands on" book in helping you to communicate with those that have the disease.
Dr. Mary Cail is the author and she has certainly done her research on this book.After I was first diagnosed people didn't know how to talk to me.
They thought (and some still do) that I couldn't think for myself, that I couldn't understand them and they would talk around me, not to me.
They would (and some still do) say --"You look great -- you don't have Alzheimer's", or "we all forget things every now and then I'm sure you're fine".
They say things like this because they don't know what else to say.
Dr. Cail helps you out with this.
She gives you avenues to go down with those with the disease -- in all stages of the disease, not just early on-set.
Some of the stories in the book are sad, but you need to read them.
It will help you understand the disease from the perspective of someone who has Alzheimer's.In terms of full disclosure, I must tell you that she has used some things from this blog in her book, but that isn't why you should buy it.
She deals with the "elephant in the room" kinds of things that happen on a regular basis to us that have the disease.
No one wants to broach the subject but she helps you through this.
She shows that we don't have to be "alone" in our disease if our friends and family know how to deal with it.
Most Alzheimer's patients and family will tell you that after the diagnosis, friends pull away.
You don't get those invitations to go out, you don't get company very often.
Dr. Cail tells you how to feel comfortable in those situations.
Some of my friends point blank asked me after my diagnosis -- what should I say to you if I see you and you don't recognize me?
I was grateful for the question, because they cared enough to want to know the answer.
Today, sometimes I see people I know out shopping and they avoid me -- I don't know if they avoid me because they didn't see me or if they just don't know what to say.
I know it's hard.
but friends make the effort and this book helps.Dr.
Cail's book can be found on Amazon athttp://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&field-keywords=The+All-Weather+Friend%27s+Guide+to+Alzheimer%27s+Disease&x=0&y=0I can't do the book justice here, but if you get the book, you'll be glad you did.
And, share it with your friends -- it will help them understand Alzheimer's so much more.

I was having a problem with the computer downloading my first post, but I seem to have corrected it.
Things are still going great here in Australia.
We have had some amazing experiences.
Last night we went to Phillips Island, and saw thousands of "little penguins" come ashore for mating season.
You can't take photos of them, but the penguins are only 12 to 13 inches tall and they are so cute.
It was really amazing.Weather is cooperating although we are going to have a little rain today.
We are off to Rod Laver's arena today and the site of theAustralian Open.
Golf is really cheap to play here but we won't be doing that -- as it takes too much time.Alan is a great tour guide and getting me around the city pretty well.
I get tired, but I'm trying to keep up.
Jennifer and Alan are being very patient with me.
I thank them for that.

Well, we made it Down Under.
I wasn't sure if I should kiss the ground or not when I got here as this is something I have always wanted to do.
The flight over was long, but certainly worth it.
Sydney reminds me a lot of San Francisco.
We toured the infamous opera house yesterday and it was gorgeous.
I'll try to post some photos soon.
We also spent some time with kangaroos, koalas, wmbats, dingoes, wallabys, and lots of birds yesterday.
The variety of birds is just amazing and they are all so colorful.
The harbour is beautiful.
As I see things I keep thinking about my friends back home as to what they would like about the city.
Pody -- if you are reading this -- this is definitely a city for you and Rick -- with all the art, architecture and boats!!!
The time change has taken a while to get used to.
I have sinced stopped asking everyone what day it is.
I have certainly become a follower on this trip.
Alan has taken the lead and I am grateful for that.
I've had a couple of meltdowns with all the people and the noise, but we have managed that.
Sydney is a big city and I have to remember that it has lots of people and that bothers me.
But, we are adjusting.
Getting my medicine adjusted from morning and night time pills has been interesting.
Alan isn't around me that much anymore so it is difficult for him to guess when things might be a problem for me.
But, I'm here and I'm enjoying myself.
He's taking care of me and that is good!
Jennifer is taking lots of photos and once I get some more time on the internet I will try to post some.
The weather has been beautiful.
It is the beginning of spring here.
And, it is after the "busy season" so it is not as crowded (or so I am told) as it during the peak months.
Our airline, Qantas, is threatening to strike next week and we have four flights left including our return trip home next week.
We are watching it carefully, but it would be a shame if we had to stay longer --- although Alan's new employer would not appreciate that much I'm sure.
Lots of seafood here as you can imagine.
Sydney is heavily influenced by Asians.
We are heading to Melbourne today and we are told that in addition to an Asian flair there as well, it has the second largest Greek population outside of Greece, so that should be interesting.
Thanks for reading -- more soon.

It's been an interesting day for me.
I always get up early each morning and go out and get the paper.
Usually, still dressed in my pajamas with my robe on.
Today, I went out to get the paper and then I went and got in my car.
I have no idea how long I sat in my car, but eventually I realized that I should be in the house since I didn't have my keys.That was kind of a sign to me that I probably needed to stay inside today and not venture too far away from the house without someone with me.Kind of a bummer, when it is also your birthday.

It's that time of year again -- the crisp cool mornings have finally returned to Georgia.
I think fall is my favorite time of the year.There is a lot going on right now and it makes me anxious -- but I know this will pass.
Our Walk To End Alzheimer's is October 15th.
I am hoping for gorgeous weather like we have been having.
The day after that I'm off to LA only to connect to my long awaited trip to Australia.
I still can't believe it.
That has been on my bucket list for so long.
My son has made this happen.
I don't travel all that well these days but I know that he will take good care of me.
I also know that I have some followers from "down under" so if you have some suggestions for us, please let me know!He and his wife are moving back to the Atlanta area as I write this.
When we return he'll be working for a large law firm in Atlanta.
I'm so glad they will be close.
I know part of the reason they are moving back here is because of my health, and I wish that weren't the case, but I am glad they are going to be "home" again.
This afternoon I get to go speak to one of my favorite groups, a gerentology class at UGA.
The professor invites me every year and I really enjoy talking with her students.
They always have lots of questions.
And, many times have a very different perspective on Alzheimer's.
A chance meeting of this professor happened several years ago when I was on my way to an Alzheimer's meeting in Chicago and she was on the same shuttle bus from Athens to the Atlanta airport.
I'm so glad I have gotten to know her.
She also fields a team for our annual walk.And, I have a new book for you to consider.
It's written by Dr. Mary Cail and it is called "The All Weather Friend's Guide To Alzheimer's Disease".
I haven't personally read it yet, but it is available on Amazon.
Here is a link to her website http://www.allweatherfriend.com/.
One of the lines on her website is "Books to help friends be friends when it matters most".
I like that.
One thing that you hear quite frequently with people that have Alzheimer's is how many of their friends turned their backs on them after receiving a diagnosis.
I'm anxious to read her book.

Dear, true and loving friends don't come easy.
I've known Meg for almost thirty years and although we don't see each other as often as I would like, each time we do see each other, we pick up exactly where we left off.Thank you, Meg, for being my friend.

I've received quite a few emails and calls in the last couple of days regarding the new Intranatal Insulin drug therapy that has been mentioned so frequently in the news.
You can read about this here http://archneur.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/archneurol.2011.233.
The data that was reported this week, was initally presented at the 2010 Alzheimer's Association International conference.
And, one of the lead researchers, Suzanne Craft, was awarded a research grant from the Alz.
Assn.
to follow up on these findings.
Based on the article above, this will now go into further stages of clinical trials.
Please note that only 104 people were used in this particular studay at this time.
While it sounds promising, we need to remember that more trials are needed to determine if this is truly effective.
Let's hope for the best -- we'll keep our fingers crossed.Our Walk To End Alzheimer's is coming up in a month.
Hard to believe that it is already here.
you can still make a contribution if you follow this linkhttp://walktoendalz.kintera.org/faf/donorReg/donorPledge.asp?ievent=454828&lis=1&kntae454828=4D7AE01A5EA5463FA8C3FF9F86D75AE0&supId=48686180 .
I would appreciate your support whatever size it is!
!I've been extremely anxious these days and hard to settle myself down.
I don't know the reason.
I have a lot going on with the walk and some other things, but I just can't seem to get things together in my mind.
I know I am a pain to live with -- I'm not liking myself that much these days, let alone know what I'm doing to my husband and others around me.On a brighter note, it is getting closer and closer to when my son and daughter-in-law move back to the Atlanta area.
I'm so glad they are moving back.
My son finishes his federal clerkship next week in Washington DC and has taken a law firm job in Atlanta.
The day after our Walk to End Alzheimer's I'm heading to LA and then on to the trip of a lifetime.
I am going to Australia.
I can't believe it actually.
This is something I have wanted to do my entire life and I'm a bit overwhelmed to think that I am actually doing it.
It's on my bucket list and I have been trying to tick all those things off.
This will be one big thing off that list for sure.
Thanks to my son, this is happening.
We have looked at going for some time, but there was never a right time.
He was always in school or moving or working.
But, we have a little window of opportunity before he starts his new job and we've taken it.
I couldn't do it without him and I just can't believe that it is finally going to happen.
It will have taken 56 years to get there and I'm sure it will be worth the wait!

I've received so many emails and calls today.
As many of you know, I am a big women's college basketball fan.
We've lived in Athens for 30 years and have followed the UGA Lady Bulldogs since moving here.
Our head coach, Andy Landers, also starting coaching the team at the same time, so I like to consider Andy a friend of mine.
When I was first diagnosed with early on set Alzheimer's, I sent an email out to all my friends.
Within a matter of hours of sending that email out, Andy called and said he was coming to pick me up for lunch, to hear all about it and wanted to know what he could do to help.
Those are the kinds of friends that we all need.
So, I thought of that today, when I heard the news that Pat Summitt, head coach of the University of Tennessee Lady Vols was diagnosed with early on-set Alzheimer's at the age of 59.
Coach Summitt has been a big adversary of ours, but she is also to be admired for what she has done with her teams over the years.
She made a video statement on the Lady Vols site today talking about the diagnosis and being very upfront about it.
She sensed some relief in knowing what she had and now know what she is facing.
I felt the same way -- I wanted to know what my problem was and then to deal with it.
Coach Summitt has a lot of support, from her family, her fans and her UT family.
She plans to continue coaching and I'm sure she will try to live as normal of a life as she can.
I know she has great assistance and will get the support she needs from them and the University.
I hope, that she, like myself, will have many more productive years ahead of her.
She's tough, she's strong and she will make the best of her life.
I have had lots of people reach out to me today -- wanting to know if I heard about Coach Summitt and what I thought.
No one wishes this on anyone, but I wish her the best.
Also, tonight, Glen Campbell was interviewed for the ABC News -- his full interview will be played tonight on Nightline.
Mr. Campbell was diagnosed with Alzheimer's and is speaking out about it for the first time.
In other news, people inquired as to how Alan did with the earthquake in DC.
He said that his building which is right across from the Capitol was evacuated and then they were sent home.
He walked home as the traffic was bad because everyone was trying to get home, and the metro system had slowed down.
I told him he should have had a big one like this when he was living in California not Washington DC.
Tonight he and Jen went down to take a look at the new Martin Luther King memorial.
He said it was pretty impressive.
Comedian Dick Gregory was there tonight -- he wasn't sure who he was as he is a little old for Alan to know him.
But lots of people were taking his picture and he called to see if I knew who he was.
I guess moms are good for something.

I'm not MIA -- although I'm sure it seems it.
I've been busy.
I was in Atlanta a few days, then in Chicago for a few days, then to a friend's cabin at Lake Russell (Thanks Suzanne for a quiet relaxing weekend) and then in Atlanta again for a few days to watch two days of the PGA Championship at the Atlanta Athletic Club.
It was all great fun, but I need time to relax and rewind.
Although -- I'm off again tomorrow to another Alzheimer's meeting in Atlanta.
When we were at the golf tournament, I couldn't remember anyone's name.
I saw the golfers and knew them, but then couldn't remember their name.
On the practice days the golfers do not have people following them around with little signs with their names and scores on them.
Their names usually only appear on their bags.
And, if the caddies are carrying them the way they are suppose to (and they usually do) you don't see the name because the name part is always facing the ground.
If the caddie stands the bag up on the green, you have to be lucky enough to have it facing you.
Luckily enough for me there were enough people around that I usually overheard someone saying their name.
I know I was tired when going but it was really bad.
Once I get the photos from the camera downloaded I will try to post some.
Sometimes I have a hard time doing that on this blog.
More soon -- and hopefully sooner not later.

Several people over the last few weeks have asked me if I have a bucket list.
I have never sat down and actually made a list, but maybe I should.
Before my diagnosis, I used to say "before I die I want to do _______".
Then sometimes I would get into my head that once I did that particular thing I was for sure going to die.
So I started thinking of multiple things so I wouldn't exhaust my list.
So, maybe that is why I don't write it down.
However, since my diagnosis some of the things I had thought before I wanted to do, don't appeal to me as much.
My priorities have certainly changed.I've read a couple of articles lately about improving your odds of being lucky.
I'm not sure that is really a true statement as I thought lucky always meant by chance something fortunate happened to you.
So strategically planning something isn't by chance.
But several things that may have been on my bucket list at some point have happened because I was at the right place at the right time (like meeting certain people) -- that may be considered luck -- but when I think of it I had probably put myself in a certain spot in order for that to happen even though it wasn't a conscious decision on my part.
I'm not sure I'm explaining this the best way I can -- but I think of a bucket list as something you concsiously set out to do and then achieve it.Some things I've always wanted to do or have:SkydiveGo to AustraliaWin a tennis tournamentShoot a hole in oneMeet Maria ShriverOwn a red Mazda MiataHave a screened in porchBe skinnyMake a difference to someoneSome of these I've achieved, some I haven't.What's on your bucket list?

I wanted to take a few minutes to point you in the direction of a few upcoming events.
I apologize for the late notice on the first one, but I've been out of town a few days.1.
http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/forum/andelot-alzheimers.cfmHere is a link to a webcast tomorrow (Friday, July 22 at 12 noon ET) about the value of knowing about an early diagnosis of Alzheimer's.
Here is a description I was forwardedOur upcoming webcast event, "Alzheimer's: What is the Value of Knowing Early?
A View Across Five Countries" presented in collaboration with Reuters will focus on the public's perception of the disease, where the medical and scientific communities currently are with testing and treatment, and what governments in countries around the world are doing to address this growing public health crisisIf you go to the link you can post questions for the panelists.2.
The National Alzheimer's Project Act (NAPA) is seeking input from people that have been affected by the disease.
Many states are holding input sessions.
(Ours in Georgia is on Saturday August 13th).
To find a town hall meeting/input session in your area go to http://napa.alz.org/ and click on the events tab.
It will bring up many of the input sessions across the country that you have a chance to participate it.
This is our chance for us to be heard.
Please take a moment and check it out -- we don't get this opportunity very often, so please take advantage of it.

Another Alzheimer's related story on StoryCorps.
Thought you might like to listen http://storycorps.org/listen/stories/betsy-brooks-and-john-grecsek/This ran on NPR sometime late last week.
I've written about StoryCorps before and it's worth listening to!

It's 3 a.m. and I can't sleep.
This doesn't happen too often for me, but I thinking I am coming down with a cold and I just don't feel real well.
So, I'm up and thought I would write a few words.A few people I know are going through some "transitions" in life right now.
Different circumstances for all of them, but transitions just the same.
I got to thinking about how we perceive these times in our lives.
Some take the bull by the horns and run with it, some fear change, some try to change their course and others just take what comes along.
I think over the years I have tried all of these things.
But, in the end, they weren't things I could control so the effort I put in didn't really matter because it was going to turn out the way it did for better or worse.
It's funny how we envision things happening and then see the how they really happen.It's not what we thought it would look like at all.
Kind of like thinking we knew the end to a good book and it didn't turn out to be anything like we thought is was going to be, but it was a good ending anyway.
Or thinking that we found a missing piece of a puzzle only to find out it really wasn't the right one and the one we were looking for didn't seem to be the right fit the first time we looked at it.
I know the people that are dealing with this right now will all make it through their respective transitions, but they might not believe they will.
Things will work out and perhaps not in the way they envisioned them, but they are strong people and they will make it work in the end.
It's hard to see when you are in the midst of it, but it will.For those that know me, I don't make lemonade out of the lemons, I just eat the lemons!

Yes, it has been awhile since I last posted.
My husband was gone for a week and I must say that I took advantage of the peace and quiet at home and tried to do lots and lots of things around the house.
I didn't get near as much accomplished as I had wanted because I can't seem to concentrate that long anymore, but I got some things done and I thoroughly enjoyed my "alone time".I've also had a few writing projects I have had to do lately.
And, that hasn't been going so well.
Can't quite seem to get those words down on paper and it gets me so frustrated.
I don't know how many times I start and stop while still in the end having to ask for help.
I might as well ask for help up front and be done with it -- but that is that stubborn independent streak I'm not willing to give up just yet!

Last night, my good friend Carol and I went to Atlanta to a fundraising event for the Alzheimer's Association -- Dancing With The Stars.
The event was great, had over 500 people in attendance and raised over $225,000!
Great job by everyone!
Former Atlanta Mayor Shirley Franklin won the dance contest.
It was a great night and great effort by everyone involved.
Thanks to Carol for being my date!

I'm back home after five days in DC.
It was nice spending time with my son and daughter-in-law, but my main purpose there was to attend the Alzehimer's Association's Advocacy Forum.
We spent one whole day on Capitol Hill talking to our legislators and their aides about the two bills I mentioned in my post below.
Reaction was good and hopefully we will see some movement on these bills in the near future.I was also able to meet many folks who belong to a Facebook group called "Memory People".
It was started several months ago and has almost 700 people in the group.
Had I thought about it before, I would have planned to have a "meet up" with everyone, but as word spread that some of the group's members were there we were able to meet.
At first the Facebook group started out with just those with Alzheimer's and has grown to include caregivers as well.
It is a closed group and you need to be invited to be a part of it, but if you are interested in it, please leave me a message with your email address (I won't publish it) and I'll get back to you.My husband accompanied me to DC but didn't go to the meetings with me.
He says it depresses him.
I understand that -- it depresses me too, but I get through it.
Having him with me was hard.
Hard from the standpoint that I can only process so much information at a time.
Usually when I go to these meetings, I'm able to go to my room at night and not have to talk to anyone, not have to listen to the television blaring and just have some down quiet time.
When you are sharing a room, that is hard to do.
I couldn't really relax or wind down before it was time to go to another meeting.
I know I only absorbed about half of what was said because my brain was on overload, but I was there.
I also worried about what my husband was doing, when and where to meet him, etc.
Plus, as you know from my other posts, he worries about everything -- the weather, the cab fares, the restaurants, you name it he worries about it.
And he doesn't just worry silently -- he has to share with me.
I've lived with it for over 30 years -- i should be used to it right?
Again.....slow learner!
I encourage you to hop on over the website for the Alzheimer's Association and check out what happened at the Advocacy Forum.
And, if you aren't already an advocate -- I hope you would consider doing it.
It doesn't take much time, and we need you.
Another site I would encourage you to go to is http://www.alzimpact.org/.
Alzheimer's Impact movement (AIM) is a nonpartisan, nonprofit advocacy organization working in strategic partnership with the Alzheimer's Association to make Alzheimer's disease a national priority.
There's lots of great information on the site about current legislation and issues that are vital in moving our cause forward "A World Without Alzheimer's"

I'm in Washington DC right now.
I'm getting ready in a few minutes to head to capitol hill for meetings with legislators and aides to ask for more funding for Alzheimer's research.
It's a rainy day here in DC .
I'm at an advocates forum and this year over 600 people are here.
Over 300 of these people are here for the first time -- that says a lot!
We are here to help get the Alzheimer's Breakthrough Act passed as well as the HOPE act which insures a care plan for those with an Azlheimer's diagnosis.Yesterday, Melody Barnes spoke to our group at lunch.
She is the Director of Domestic Policy for President Obama.
Imagine my surprise when in the middle of her speech she mentioned my name!
She then began to quote from an article I had written for The Shriver Report.
I was shocked when I heard my name mentioned by her.
My cell phone started buzzing with text messages from others in the room commenting about my mention.
It was a little embarassing but I was humbled at the same time.
I guess the administration is looking at lots of sources out there on Alzheimer's.
I've also met some folks from the Facebook Page Memory people.
Many of them are here for the first time and are enjoying their experiences.
Have also had a chance to spend time with my son and daughter-in-law while in DC.
More when I return.

I received a comment on my post below.
It is from the cousin of the young man who got up to dance with his aunt.
Thank you Ms. Reynolds for sharing this lovely story.
I didn't want to just post this in comments, as many of my readers don't always read them.
So, I hope you don't mind.
And, speaking from someone that has Alzheimer's -- I know that this certainly meant a great deal to your mom.
We should all wish for such a "touching moment" in our lives.I came across your blog and thought I'd tell you the story behind that "touching moment".
The couple you saw dancing was my mom and my cousin (he's more like her grandson than nephew as his father is my father's baby brother).
"Look At Us" was my parents song from the day they heard it until last year when Daddy was snatched away from us following a tragic accident.
Mom has Alzheimers and Daddy was taking care of her.
She now lives with me, my husband and daughter.
On April 29, 2003, 3 days before my parents' 50th anniversary, my niece had gotten front row seats for my parents and aunt and uncle (parents of the young man you saw dancing) to go and see Vince in Sarasota, Florida.
We had made them a sign and my aunt gave a letter to a security guard before the concert asking that Vince sing "Look At Us" for my parents.
Not only did he sing it for them but he brought them up on stage and they danced on stage while he sang.
It was a moment that is one of my mom's most treasured memories and one that Alzheimer's hasn't touched.
Before Daddy died he promised Mom he'd take her to see Vince one more time.
When my cousin heard on the radio that Vince was coming to Macon and it was an Alzheimers fundraiser he called to let us know and I bought tickets the day they went on sale.
We knew this was orchestrated by God as it was 3 days after Daddy's birthday and Mom and Dad's anniversary and with Mom having Alzheimers we knew how special this opportunity was.
Both of Daddy's sister's, his only living brother and his wife, their son,and my husband and I were there with Mom.
We didn't tell her where we were going and she was so surprised and excited when she picked up the program from her chair.
My aunt and I had written Vince letters and I gave them to the guitar player when he was tuning he guitar before the concert.
If you remember Vince dedicated the song in memory of Dennis Segars - my dad.
So now you know...... the rest of the story.
Vince Gill is an amazing person that has given my mom and my family 2 of the most precious memories and I will forever be grateful to him for taking the time to read a letter and then having the compassion to touch the lives of people he's never met in such a special way!

<doc date=Thursday, May 05, 2011>
Tonight I was in Macon for an Alzheimer's Fundraiser featuring Vince Gill.
I'll post some photos soon, however, one very touching moment during the concert is when Vince played "Look At Us".
I noticed a young man (late 20'as I would say) get up and an older lady followed him.
I guess she was in her early 80's maybe?
Anyway, the young man, took the lady in his arms and started dancing with her.
I'm sure it was his grandmother or something, but it was so touching.
It brought a tear to my eye.
Several people got up to take their photo and when Vince Gill finished his song there were lots of women around that young man clapping for him and his partner.
I shed a tear at that, too.
How many young men would do that -- with 2,000 people in the room!

Larry King did a special on Alzheimer's Sunday evening.
You can find more about it here http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2011/larryking/I recorded it and watched it this morning.
It's very informative for those not knowing a lot about Alzheimer's.
If you are already dealing with Alzheimer's you probably didn't learn much, but it was a good overview.
Enough to get people talking some more about the disease.
We can't stop talking about it!

<doc date=Wednesday, April 27, 2011>
In a few weeks I'll be joining hundreds as we go to Washington DC to help lobby our legislators for more support for Alzheimer's Disease.
In light of this, I'm asking for your help.
There are several things you can do.
One of the things that we will be asking support for is the HOPE for Alzheimer's Act.
It stands for Health Outcome, Planning and Education for Alzheimer's.
This will help with early and accurate diagnosis and information for familes dealing with this deadly disease.You can read more about it here -- including the legsilators that have actually signed on as a co-sponsor of the bill.http://www.kintera.org/site/pp.asp?c=mmKXLbP8E&b=6301189THEN -- you can go here http://www.kintera.org/siteapps/advocacy/ActionItem.aspx?c=mmKXLbP8E&b=6742875&auid=8213583&tr=y and send your legislators an email asking them for their support.
It's only a few clicks people and it will certainly move our cause forward.Another item worth looking at: A new report put out by the Alzheimer's Association regarding Baby Boomers and the impact this disease will have on everyone!
It's important information so please take a few minutes to look at it if you have a chance.
You can find information about the report here: http://alz-news.org/And, lastly, for now, some of you may have seen that CNN is airing a special on Alzheimer's Disease on May1st.
It is hosted by Larry King.
It's on Sunday night, May 1st at 8:00 p.m.
ET.
Here is a short piece about it from CNN http://www.cnn.com/2011/HEALTH/04/27/seth.rogen.alzheimer/Thanks for reading and helping!

Last night I caught a few minutes of Hallmark Hall of Fame movie, Beyond the Blackboard.
And, while I didn't catch all of the movie, I caught many of the commercials.
My mom used to say that I would always watch the commercials and leave when the shows were on, so I guess I come by that honestly.
And, I worked for an advertising agency for many years, so yes, I'm into those commercials.
One thing about the commercials last night was that Hallmark showed a current commercial and then a commercial from twenty or thirty years ago.
The fact that I actually remember some of the old commercials was amazing.One of the commercials depicted a woman looking into an old box with cards that her children had given her over the years.
This tugged at my heart strings for a bit, because, what mother doesn't do that?
Don't we all save things our children have made or given us at one time or another?
I know we can't keep everything, but I'll bet that most moms that are reading this also have a little treasure box tucked away where they can go and get some of those special treaures from their children (or other loved ones).
I know I do.
Quite often I find myself going back to "my box" because I don't know when I am going to forget those things.
I think,too, that your children don't realize how much those things mean to you until they themselves become parents.
I think about the elctronic age (yes I realize I am writing this in the electronic age) we live in and how in the not too distant future cards (like books and newspapers) will become a thing of the past.
It's not the same printing out an email as to when someone takes the time to sign a card or write a note.
I know I have written about this before, but the Hallmark commercial last night had me thinking about it all day today.Please think twice when the next holiday or event comes up and you quickly type that email to a special person.
Think how much more it would mean to them to have a hand written note they can cherish.
I hope that never goes away.And, speaking of special things, my two "surrogate sons" that I have talked about so much on my blog, have both found out that their wives are expecting babies and within two weeks of each other.
One found out today that they are having a girl.
The other couple doesn't want to know.
I'm so excited for them.

I've been getting out a little more since my knee surgery -- trying to get my stamina back.
I am still prone to swelling when I'm up on my knee too much so I have to watch it, but it is coming along.
Yesterday, I went out to pick up a few things at the store.
I had some coupons and there were some specials going on at the office supply store I was at.
When I was looking at what I wanted to buy, I couldn't figure out what the best deal was.
Should I buy more than one with my coupon?
some items were buy one get one free, was that a better deal than what I went in there for?
Too many choices and too many variables for my mind to wrap around .
Since I was looking at an item with a relatively high ticket price I didn't want to make a mistake.
The sales people kept asking me if they could help me and I was so confused by everything I couldn't even explain what I needed to tell them or ask them.
I know I stood there for a very long time trying to figure it out.
I know that it was probably something very simple, but I just got so frustrated I left the store.
Why do I keep putting myself in these situations?
Because I want to be able to do it and I used to be able to do it.
I have to keep telling myself that I am not stupid......Simple things can be difficult for those with Alzheimer's.
</doc>
<doc date=Friday, April 01, 2011>
about a lot of things.
One is posting to this blog.
Some of my friends have one day week where they devote to writing something in their blog and they give it a name, i.e.
Mindful Mondays, Terrific Tuesday.....you get the drift.
Maybe I will have to resort to that.
My knee is healing.
That's a good thing.
Most of you that know me, know that I am not a real patient person and of course I want to be all better, right now.
But, that ain't happening.
But I have started walking around the house without my cane, am doing physical therapy three times a week.
I started driving this week -- o.k.
only to therapy but it is a start.
I still have a difficult time sleeping but hopefully that will get better as well.
It's coming along....just slowly.
A dear friend dropped by this morning with dinner for us.
She is someone I have known for close to twenty years.
Our paths first crossed when she was working for the local newspaper and she covered some of the work I was doing special events for Downtown Athens.
We kind of drifted apart as our jobs and lives took some twists and turns.
But we've picked up right where we left off several years ago when we both made an effort to get together.
You know how it is -- one will say "we need to do lunch" or "we need to go have coffee" and then you never do.
Well, we finally did and I'm so thankful for that.
Thanks for being a great friend Meg -- I love you!
Mentally, I haven't been feeling real good.
I think basically because of the limitations my knee has given me.
Hate being housebound and feeling useless.
Plus, it has been raining for about the last 5 days and it has just been dreary.
But, I probably turned somewhat of a corner this week.
I am finally able to wear "regular clothes" -- mainly meaning my jeans/slacks/pants.
I couldn't before because my knee was so swollen I couldn't get the pants on over my knee.
So, I have been living in sweat pants or shorts and it has been a little too cool for shorts.
Getting dressed in real clothes has helped me mood a little.
And, since I have started strenuous therapy I at least am able to ride the stationary bike to get my blood pumping!
This also helps with my mental attitude as well as helps me think clearer.
I realized some time ago that there is definitely a connection between exercising and brain function -- or at least there is for me.
I definitely do better dealing with my Alzheimer's when I am exercising on a regular basis.
Remember, whatever is good for your body is good for your brain!
Here's to getting better faster!!!

I know this is rambling today because I can't wrap my thoughts around this.
People's actions or inactions as the case may be drive me crazy.My mom and I never really got along as I was growing up, but she did teach me to be decent and kind to other people.
I also met a young man in college that had a big influence over me -- he was such a giving person and he taught me that doing for others made you feel good.
And, it does -- or at least for me anyway.So, when people say they are going to do things, they should do them, or at least let you know that they aren't.It amazes me how people expect certain things from you and just take this for granted.
I do things for people because I want to, not because I'm suppose to.
There's a big difference there.I know this post probably doesn't make much sense to you, as I said I am rambling.
I just needed to write it down!Sometimes, these posts, can't be about Alzheimer's.
There is more to life, and life is too short.On another note, my staples are out and physical therapy is in full swing.
</doc>
<doc date=Thursday, March 17, 2011>
I'm going to the doctor today to get the staples out of my knee.
It looks pretty ugly, but I guess I am progressing o.k.
Physical therapy will take awhile but I'll get there eventually.It's been so nice out that I'm planning to at least get some fresh air in the next couple of days just by sitting outside.
Even if I can't walk, I can at least enjoy the beautiful weather.Today, the head of the nuclear regulatory commission was on tv discussing the radiation situation in Japan.
I'm not sure I could have told you this gentleman's name, as he doesn't get much press and that is probably a good thing.
But I had to laugh, as my son Alan was looking at colleges he was saying that he either wanted to be "head of the nuclear regulatory commission, or write speeches for the president".
Go figure.
He turned out to be an attorney -- not sure where that fits into this but I'm sure he is rolling his eyes if he reads this!

has started on my knee.
The day after I got home from the hospital the physical therapist was there and they are back today -- ten visits by the end of the month.
I go back on thursday to get the staples out of my knee.
I'll feel better doing therapy after I get them out, as when I feel something kind of "pulling" I'm not sure if it the incision/staples or just normal.
Friends have been great to bring over meals to help my husband out.
I really appreciate them for doing that.
Now, if I could just get some folks to volunteer to come clean my house!
Why is it that whenever you are sick or incapacitated that your house always looks messier -- or maybe it is just me.
But, I mopped and cleaned the kitchen floor before I went into the hospital and it is already dirty.
Ralph use to complain it was me spilling coffee and food in the kitchen that made it dirty -- but now I know that is definitely not the case since I haven't been in the kitchen!
Oh well -- having a dirty kitchen floor is the least of my worries!The weather is beautiful here.
Wish I could go out and enjoy it.
My allergies are so bad that I'm afraid if I even go out and sit in it at this point it wouldn't be good.
But, before the week is out I know I will have to get out -- I don't want to be cooped up all day long every day!

What a classy lady Maria Shriver is.
After the Shriver Report came out, she was nice enough to send me a hand written note, thanking me for my contribution.
I sent a condolence letter to her after her father passed away from Alzheimer's not too long ago.
Then, yesterday, in the mail I receive a handout that was given out at the funeral for her father, as well as a personal note.
How thoughtful of her.
Thanks to her for helping move our cause forward.
I would love to meet her one day.

I'm in Nashville with friends for the women's  SEC basketball tournament.
One day, when the UGA women weren't playing my friends took a little side trip and I found myself alone in Nashville.
Lots of things within walking distance from the hotel, so no problem.
Except......the little problem I have about crossing streets by myself.
I know, it sounds silly and stupid.
But, if you think about it, we don't cross the street by foot much anymore.
We pull up to the grocery, or the bank or wherever we are going and then walk into the business.
Or at least, that is the way I usually do it.
I don't find myself having to walk too far on the streets in Athens.
So, I ventured out into the streets of downtown Nashville and came to my first cross walk.
I panicked.
I forgot that this is a problem for me......mainly because I don't usually do this and normally I have someone with me.
The problem is that there are too many conflicting signals for my brain to decipher.
Thwe blinking cross walk sign, the traffic signals and traffic noise don't move smoothly through my brain.
They collide into a huge mass of confusion for me.
I don't trust the other people walking (because I don't know them) and that people walk when they are not suppose to.
I didn't want to turn back the block or so that I had walked from the hotel so I thought I would venture on and see what I could do by myself.
Sometimes, I am just determined to do it come hell or high water!
I stood at the corner for a good while before deciding to move.
I only went across the street when there were absolutely no cars coming.
This, by the way, was after the lights had cycled maybe three times.
I'm sure if there was someone watching me they were thinking this lady is a lunatic.
Down the next block I saw an officer and thought I could ask for his assistance at the next block -- which I did.
All the while thinking, what happens if this police officer is not here when I come back?
I always try to think of a contingency plan -- and it is so odd that I can usually come up with something to work (for now anyway) but I can't figure out how to get across the street!
Anyway, this officer was very friendly.
I explained my situation to him and he told me that in the direction I was going there were police officers on every corner because of the high volume of people in town --- thank you Nashville!
I ran into one officer that was on a segue way and he helped me for several blocks.
After walking around for an hour or so, I made my way back to the hotel with help from mainly the men in blue.
But, I haven't ventured out alone to walk since then.
I have stayed in a pack with my friends and they help me get by.Just another adventure in the life of someone with Alzheimer's.

One of my best friends from Illinois duaghter will be having a baby soon.
I can't believe she is going to be a mother.
She and her husband will make excellent parents, but I guess I just get to feeling old and sentimental when I think about it.
I remember when my friend first found out she was pregnant with her daughter -- its a long and funny story but it was over thirty years ago and it seems like just yesterday.
Anyway -- my best and all my love to Rachel, Mark and the new baby soon to be here.
And, two of my favorite friends -- I like to think of them as my surrogate sons, announced recently that they and their wives are soon expecting a baby.
Their due dates are just weeks apart and it will be truly amazing seeing these guys go from husbands to dads -- but they will be great.
I'm so happy for them.On another note, I spoke to another pyschology class on campus at UGA this week about Alzheimer's.
The professor gave me some questions that her students had the last time I spoke to give me an idea of some of the their thoughts.
They were certainly interesting and I will try to keep them in mind the next time I speak to a group.
Thanks Tamar for having me and best of luck to you in your studies!Next week, I'm going to get a new knee!
Yes, it's time for it.
I'll be in the hospital for a few days and then recuperating for a few months.
I'm not looking forward to the rehab time, but I'm glad to get it over with.
I'll try to be better about blogging in the next week or so, as I'll be MIA for awhile after that.
The one thing that had concerned me was going under anesthesia, as that from what I understand, can be an issue for those diagnosed with Alzheimer's.
However, it appears they will be doing an epidural for the procedure so hopefully that will be much better.Oh -- and after I get back on line, I'm going to try to be better about posting on a regular basis even if the words don't come out like they should!
I have many friends that have blogs that keep on task by coming up with weekly "issues" of their blogs by calling them, "Truthful Tuesday" or "Wacky Wednesday thoughts" -- you get it.
I'll just have to try to come up with something clever -- and I'm all for suggestions.

 After several years of emailing, and corresponding, I finally got to meet Lisa Genova, author of Still Alice and Left Neglected.
If you have been reading this blog for long, you know how I have raved about her books.
Still Alice deals with Alzheimer's disease and that is how I first became aware of Lisa.
Her second book which just came out deals with a neurological condition called Left Neglect.
It is a very interesting disorder and almost hard to believe.
But, her book certainly describes it well.
Lisa was at a Book Festival in Savannah Georgia and I took the opportunity to go hear her speak.
She was gracious enough to give me some of her free time while she was there and I so appreciate it.
I'm glad we finally got to meet in person after being "cyber friends" for so long.
Hope all went well with the rest of the festival Lisa and thanks again for sharing your time with me!

Everyone that knows me, knows that a red Mazda Miata is my dream car.
My daughter in law sent me this photo of my son in a red Mazda Miata at the DC car show.
This is so wrong -- it should be me in that driver's seat!

I've been looking at some blogs lately of people I know and I feel so inadequate after reading theirs.
They all sound intelligent, well thought out and put together.
Mine, on the other hand, are disconnected and jump around from thought to thought.
I find that I want my friends to write more so I can read more.
I'm not amazed by what they right, I guess I'm amazed at how effortless it probably is for them (and maybe it's not, but they've fooled me).
It seems they put lots and lots of thought into what they are going to write so it really has a story -- with a beginning, middle and end.
I used to fuss at my son when he was writing for school projects about having the beginning, middle and end.
Now I can't seem to find those things myself.
So, I appreciate all those that still read this blog, because a lot of times I do just ramble......without structure.....random thoughts that pop into my head -- have to write them quickly or they pop out just as fast.
Having said all of this, I want to share an experience I had yesterday and you may have to weave it all together, but it means a lot to me.Yesterday was one of those days where it was cold and rainy.
A day where you wanted to stay inside and read a book or take a nap.
But, I had plans to go out and meet some old friends for lunch.
I met these ladies thirty years ago.
That's shortly after we moved to the south.
My husband had been transferred and when he transferred many of the same people he worked with up north transferred along with him.
So when he went to work here, it was kind of like working where we used to live, because although he was in a different building, he was doing the same thing and working with the same people.I, on the other hand, was the new wife, moving to a small town, had no job and knew no one.
So, we joined a small community country club -- and when you think of country club, I'm sure you are not thinking of this one -- no white table cloths, no exclusive parties, no high initiation fees, no valet parking, no waiting list to join.
It was an affordable one for what we wanted to do --which was mainly play tennis.
There was a golf course and a swimming pool, but our main focus at the time was to play tennis.
We paid our modest amount of money to join and bought basically the "tennis package" which allowed us to make reservations for a court and play about as much tennis as we wanted.We slowly began to meet other people that played tennis and before I knew it I was on a tennis team.
Then, I was on two tennis teams.
Then I was playing in some socials....and you get the drift.
The ladies that I played with became my newest best friends.
It was my "community" at the time.
I didn't realize what an important part of my life these people would become.
We seemed to live at the tennis courts and traveled together for matches.
As we each had children, we started bringing them to the courts where the bigger ones would watch the smaller ones.
We came from different backgrounds, different counties and different cultures.
But we were all a family on the tennis court -- even though we liked some strong but friendly competition.Over the years, one by one we stopped playing tennis, or we stopped playing in league play.
We all had our reasons, whether it be family, injuries, returning to work or whatever.
But, those 25-30 people that became my community back then, still surface from time to time and we picked up where we left off.That's a long way of saying, that yesterday, I met two of these ladies for lunch.
One I had not seen in probably twenty years, the other, I have just recently gotten back in touch with and renewed that friendship.
It was great catching up with both of them and I realized how lucky I was (or am) to have these women in my life.
It didn't seem like we missed a beat in picking up our conversation -- like we were talking over the tennis net.
Although we have lost touch over the years, they (and all my tennis buddies) are people I know that I could pick up the phone and ask for help if I needed it.
We all need friends like that.
I hope they consider me to be just as an important friend to them.
I thank them for being in my life.I can remember times my son and I would be out shopping and I would run into one of my tennis friends and introduce Alan.
Many times he would turn to me and say "Mom, is there anyone you haven't played tennis with?"
It always made me smile.
I would reply "Of course, there is -- but this lady was a friend of mine, too".
They were all friends and "my family" as well.We all have our own little communities and they change the way we look at things.
Sometimes we forget that our friends help shape who we are.
I'm glad I have the friends I have....even if I don't see them as often as I should.

It's been awhile I know.
I just haven't had luck getting my words out right lately.
I did an interview with a young student yesterday from UGA for a journalism class that she was doing.
I did awful -- I didn't even make sense most of the time.
I guess it will give her a chance to use her editing skills.
I knew exactly what I wanted to say, but couldn't get it to come out the way I wanted it to.Since I last wrote, Ralph was in St. Louis for almost a week for a family funeral.
It was nice to have the house to myself.
Alan and Jennifer visited Jen's sister Christine in Chicago over the MLK weekend, and they also got to visit with my friends the Atterberrys.
I went to Alabama for a women's basketball game and am going to South Carolina this week for another women's game.Thanks to all that have commented lately -- it's interesting to see what people have on their minds.
Thanks to to Barry Petersen for making my friend Suzanne a very happy lady!
You made her day.I'm having a partial knee replacement done next month.
Not looking forward to it -- more on that later.

So far we have 6.5 inches of snow on the ground -- according to my ruler of course!
For the last few hours we have had sleet and freezing rain.
Schools/businesses have been closed all day and they are already scheduled to close tomorrow.
It's just not suppose to do this in the south!
We are hoping that we don't get much more freezing rain, as we certainly don't want the power lines to come down.
We've been there before!

<doc date=Saturday, January 08, 2011>
is a new book out by Lisa Genova.
Lisa is my friend that wrote the best seller Still Alice about a young woman with Younger On Set Alzheimer's.
Lisa's new book is about a woman who has a condition called "Left Neglect".
It is where a person with this, does not recognize his/her left side.
Lisa first told me about this condition a year or so ago when she was working on the book before Still Alice even came out.
I was intrigued with it and looked up what I could on-line.
It's a very interesting brain disease.
I'm sure this book will bring loads of attention to Left Neglected.As I said with Still Alice, run to the bookstore to get this book, don't walk.
I was mesmerized by it and it is an easy read -- even for someone with Alzheimer's.
And, while I don't suffer from left Neglected, it is a brain disease just as Alzheimer's is.
And, like I could relate to Alice in Still Alice, I can relate to the character in Left Neglected, Sarah.
In the book, Sarah has a car accident and ends up with a brain injury - Left Neglected.At one point in the book she is working on her physical therapy and her son is by her side.
Her son has Attention Deficit Disorder and while he is working on his homework, he declares himself stupid because he can't get his homework right.
Sarah asks him if he thinks she is stupid because she can't do some things right.
He tells her no.
Then Sarah says, "Right.
Neither of us is stupid.
Our brains work in a different way than most people's do, and we have to figure out how to make ours work.
But we're not stupid, okay?"
How this hit home......I feel stupid a lot of times because I can't do some simple things.
It's easy to say your stupid, even though you're not.
I guess it is the easy way out, but I fight this on a daily basis.
In another instance Sarah remarks on all the changes that have been thrust upon her in the last few months....getting used to it and redefining "normal".
I feel like I redefine the meaning of normal everyday!
In another instance Sarah talks about being helpless.
She is crying to her mother that she doesn't want to be helpless.
Her crying intensifies as she says the word helpless.
Her mother tells her she is not helpless, she just needs some help.
They are not the same."
I had to really stop and take a deep breath over this one.
While I am not helpless (now) I know I need help and it is hard to ask for help.
But there is a difference and I need to recognize that and keep moving forward.Thanks, Lisa, for writing this book.
You have another winner on your hands.

Something I like most about the holidays is hearing from everyone through Christmas Cards.
I know a lot of people have stopped sending cards in favor of electronic greetings.
But I love seeing the photo cards that come in the mail and can't believe seeing everyone's children or grandchildren growing up so fast.
And, I like hearing about what everyone has done the past year.
Staying connected with people is important to me.
And, I appreciate the cards I get each year --that people are still willing to keep in touch with me.
Then, out of the blue, I'll get a phone call from someone I haven't heard from in a very long time.
That happened again yesterday, when Patty Smith called me from Falls Church Virginia.
Patty was on the Alzheimer's Association Early Stage Advisory group several years ago.
Patty and her husband were also the driving force behind the Alzheimer's Association getting a multi million dollar grant from the American Express company for the Alz.
Association.
How nice it was to talk to Patty and hear her voice.
That meant a lot to me.
I also heard from other former advisory members over the holidays that I haven't heard from in awhile.
The holidays were a little more trying for me this year.
I think a lot played into it, but I must do a better job of pacing myself, as well as not trying to get so overwhelmed.
The latter is a little harder to do because you never know when one of those simple projects you start, are going to turn into something different -- thus the result is not so good.
But, I guess I need to relish in the fact that I cans till do so much -- although not happy with the outcome much of the time.
My son and daughter-in-law were here over the holidays.
I'm sure you have figured out that is them above.
It was nice to have them home.
I really appreciate the effort they take to get here -- with traveling during the holidays.
Luckily the snow we got in Georgia and the snow up the east coast didn't get them stranded anywhere with the times they were flying.The new year brings on lots of new challenges for me.
I think I need to look at them more as opportunities to keep me going.
Thanks to the UGA Pyschology class I spoke to for the lovely note they sent to me after speaking to their group.
One of my followers asked what type of questions they asked.
Some wanted to know if I still drove, how did I deal with the fact that I could no longer do things I once did everyday.
I shared with them how I had a difficult time crossing the streets in large cities because of all the signals flashing at once and this was a little hard for them to understand.
And, when I told them how difficult it was for me to talk on the phone and that I relied heavily on email and they asked if I was able to utilitze all the new technology with smart phones, texting and the like.
I told them that I had a hard time learning new things and had a difficult time with all the new "lingo or abbreviations" they used now!
Although, my old phone does not have a regular keyboard -- I'm still relying on the phone key pad and that takes me forever to text a message to someone.
It's interesting to hear the questions that the students ask.
The older students have a different perspective on things.
Most everyone in the classes I speak to though have known or do know someone with Alzheimer's so they can relate in some way to what I am saying.
I think the most awkward question was when someone asked me how Alzheimer's affected my sex life!Happy New Year to all!

Some people are made for traveling, others are not.
I like to travel and see new things.
It's much harder to travel by myself these days especially to new places.
But, I think my days of traveling to new places with my husband is over.
He's not a traveler.
I can no longer be the "responsible" one on the trip -- seeing to everything because my mind doesn't work that way any longer.
He has always relied on me to do that -- and he isn't capable of doing it.
He might be capable of doing it, he just doesn't want to do it.
Plus, as I've mentioned before, he is very negative.
With him, the glass is never half full or half empty -- it's always empty.
there are always a million reasons why we can't do something, or he is worrying about things that are totally out of his control, which makes a trip more trying for me and way too stressful.
Taking a trip is suppose to be fun -- not stressful.
I loved Cancun -- it just wasn't the relaxing trip I was hoping for.
And, I couldn't help but think that at some point in probably the not too distant future I won't remember it.
So, if you look at it that way, I guess it doesn't really matter in the long run whether it was a good trip or not.
But, since I have to live in the now I wish it would have been a more enjoyable trip.
I'll have to pick another traveling partner next time.

We went to UGA and had a Christmas luncheon with the women's basketball team and then we helped assemble bikes for some needy children.
We've done this for several years and it is nice be able to give something back to the community.
Each player has a person who does a scrapbook of the season for her.
I have a nice young lady, Ronika Ransford, from Washington DC that I am doing the scrapbook for.
She is pictured here with me.
Int he first photo the girls are attempting to sing We Wish You a Merry Chritmas but they had to read the words because they didn't know all of them.
Then they wanted to know what "figgy pudding" was -- that makes me feel old!

Just returned from speaking to a psychology class at UGA.
They had great questions and were very attentive considering this was their last day of classes and I probably wasn't what they wanted to hear today!
But, as always, I enjoyed it and it is my form of therapy.
Anyway, thanks for having me and best of luck on your exams!I have loads of things to do before this weekend.
I'm starting to get anxious about it.
But, I started cleaning one of my craft rooms and then one thing led to another and then I'm cleaning out more rooms.
I can't stand the clutter.
I have a hard enough time finding what I'm trying to find most of the time because I don't remember where I put things.
So, in order to help myself I have to be pretty organized and when I'm not, I get anxious.
So, I have to put off the things I need to do, in order to get organized enough to do them.
I know that sounds crazy -- but that is just the way my life is.

As man of you know from reading my blog, the two young men pictured above, used to work for me almost ten years ago now.
Chris (left) is in med school in Florida and was in town visiting for the holiday.
Josh (right) is the young man who was injured in Afghanistan a few years ago that I have written about frequently.
Josh lives nearby now and when Chris comes to town I am so honored that they spend what little time they have to see me and have lunch.
Their wives Katie and Melissa are great and we spend a lot of time laughing when we are together.
Thanks to all of you for sharing your life with me.

Personal mail -- something we don't get very much of anymore.
Most people know I like to make cards and have always been a letter writer.
Young people these days don't understand that and if my son is reading this he is probably rolling his eyes.
So, it was very refreshing to receive a beautiful hand written note from a young lady in California.
She had emailed me a few weeks back and she was working on a project for a class on Alzheimer's.
She asked if I would answer a few questions for her via email.
She was very sweet in understanding that I might not be able to answer all of them and to only answer the ones I felt comfortable with.
I did the best I could and this week I received a hand written note from her thanking me for my time.
She could have just as easily emailed me back with a thank you but she took the time out of her day to get a card, write a note and send it to me.
Thank you Kirsten -- that meant the world to me and I hope your project went well.
I miss the letter writing.
I don't do very well with it these days so I hope that my cards speak for themselves.
I'm old fashioned that way I guess.Today my husband and I had lunch with a lovely couple.
Both of these people had been my son's teachers in high school.
While my son was on the Academic Decathlon team he spent more time with them than he did with us, but considering they went to nationals each year and he learned so much we were so glad he got the opportunity.
And, what great role models they were for him.
I couldn't think of two nicer people for my son to be around.
They will always mean a lot to me and to our son.In the last few days several people have asked me about my Alzheimer's and "where I'm at with that".
Some people don't want to ask because they really aren't sure how to either broach the subject or they are not sure that I want to talk about it.
But, I respect these people in their approach -- they have started by asking something like "would it be inappropriate for me to ask about your Alzheimer's".
That is so considerate and it is nice to know they are interested.
So many people act is if it is like a big elephant in the room and it is so much easier to talk about it than to have it hanging over your head.
Our Memory Walk team raised the most money in the state......or at least we did until a company in Atlanta found out about it and matched it!
But, that is good, because more money was raised by them matching it!
A challenge is on for next year!

I have had the best three days.
My husband has been out of town and it has been wonderful.
I know that sounds bad, but he knows what I mean.
It is so quiet, I don't have to listen to the tv or the radio, I don't have to have a conversation if I don't want to.
I'm not as tired when he is gone.
I don't realize what a difference it makes until he is gone.
But my three days of peace is coming to an end.....I hate it, but back to trying to deal with reality!Another nice thing that happened this weekend that I was invited to Augusta to speak at the Memory Walk.
They did a really nice job and had about 1,000 people there.
It was a little chilly to start out with but turned out to be a beautiful day.
An added bonus was my long time friend, Suzanne went with me and we were able to catch up in the car.
I'll post photos when I get them.
Thanks to Kathy, Dee Dee and Kimberly in the Augusta Alzheimer's Association office.

OK -- I know it's only Tuesday but this week doesn't shape up too well for now.
And, last week wasn't that great either.
In the last 9 days a neighbor has died (way too early), two other friends are battling some extreme situations, I didn't have good doctor reports at either the neurologist or the orthopedic doctor dealing with my knee.This weekend (so far) is looking good -- my husband is heading out of town for a few days and I cannot wait for the quiet in my house.
It will give me time to rest and regroup.
However, last night he told me there was a chance he wasn't going.
He is hardly ever gone and I so look forward to when he leaves for a few days.
I'll have to wait and see how things go.I am looking forward also to going to Augusta this weekend.
They have asked me to come and speak at their Memory Walk on Saturday morning.
I haven't been there in a long time and I am anxious to see the staff down there.Hope everyone gets out to vote today.

appeared this morning on ABC's new program This Week this morning to talk about the Shriver report which I mentioned in my post below.
If you missed it, here is the link -- just click on the Maria Shriver photo for the video.
http://abcnews.go.com/thisweek Ms. Shriver's complete report will be released on Tuesday October 19th.
The Shriver Report main emphasis is the role women play in Alzheimer's.
I was privileged to be part of this report.
If you care about Alzheimer's -- please get a copy of this, share with everyone you know.
The more we discuss this, the better off we will be.
She makes some compelling arguments.
The government needs to pass the legislation of the National Alzheimer's Project Act (NAPA).
We are the only civilized country that does not have a plan to deal with Alzheimer's.
That is sad.
Urge your federal legislature to sign on to this bill.

It was released today by Maria Shriver and the Alzheimer's Association.
You may know that Maria's father has Alzheimer's and she has championed the cause.There will be a series next week on ABC News about Alzheimer's and it is on the cover of Time Magazine this week.

My son came home this past weekend for my birthday.
It was a quick trip -- but it was nice to have him home just the same.
We went out to play golf on Sunday morning and had someone snap this photo of us at the golf course.
Although Alan is not a Georgia Bulldog, he did agree to have his photo taken under the Bulldog sign.
I guess I don't realize how much I miss my son, until I see him.
I guess that is the way with most parents.
I know I haven't written in awhile.
I have been reading some other Alzheimer's blogs lately and when I read them, I feel so inadequate in writing this blog as they all seem to have some profound things to say.
I many times, have profound thoughts (or at least I think they are) but then I can't translate them onto the page.
That's frustrating.
I turned the big 55 this past weekend.
When I turned 30 or 40 or even 50 it didn't bother me.
Turning 35 bothered me and this one has.
But, if you had asked me eight years ago when I was diagnosed with younger on-set Alzheimer's if I would be bothered by my 55th birthday, I probably would have said "I'll be lucky to be alive by then".
So, I guess I shouldn't let it bother me --I'm still here!

My son is coming home the weekend of the 9th -- it will be a quick trip -- less than 48 hours actually, but I'm glad he's coming home.
Sometimes you just need to see your kids -- it's been about 5 months since I have seen him and even though that isn't a long time in many ways, it can sometimes seem a lot longer than that.
We share October birthdays and we have always tried to be together as close to those dates as possible -- sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.
But, even if it is for just a short weekend, it will be nice to have him home.Our Memory Walk is less than a month away now.
So many people have put so much into it -- I'm just hoping for no rain this year.
Last year was the first year we encountered rain and it was miserable.In a few short weeks The Shriver Project will be out.
It will focus on Alzheimer's disease and as it gets closer to release, I'll fill you in more about it.
First Lady of California Mary Shriver is behind it and a lot of work has been put into the report.
I'm anxious to see it come out.It's finally cooled down here in the south -- no more 90 degrees day for awhile.

in posting I know.
Have been busy -- and have a bum knee.
Went to the doctor and he has me on crutches for a few weeks.
After already having had a couple of knee surgeries and a broken foot, I'm used the crutches, but I still hate them.
We'll see how things go.Was in Atlanta a few days this week on Alz.
business.
Things are gearing up for Memory Walk -- although it is a little over a month away, there is still plenty to get done.
I'm just hoping for no rain this year.USA Today is doing a story on Alzheimer's -- think I mentioned it in a previous post -- it is due out next Thursday the 16th so be watching out for it.
The writer, Mary Brophy Marcus has been working on it for some time and she has certainly done her research.
Should be good.

This has not been a good week for me.
I've been "off".
It's so hard to describe but it seems like I am about five steps behind where I should be all the time.
I was having an extremely hard time explaining things this week.
I was trying to work on a few of my projects around the house and needed some help from my husband.
Before I asked him I told him that it wasn't a good day for me and I it was going to be difficult for me to explain what I needed so he just needed to stay with me.
He doesn't hear what I am saying most of the time and he caught the part that I needed help, but not the part about my having a hard time explaining what I needed.
So of course, we got into a huge argument because he was mad that I couldn't explain exactly what I needed.
I got upset, he was mad and it was just not good.
I told him I would figure it out somehow -- I have yet to do that, but I can't go back to that scene again!
It is just so frustrating to not be able to communicate efficiently.
I wonder that as this disease progresses and it gets harder to actually convey anything, that will it be clear in my head and just not be able to get it out?
Just not being able to communicate?Lots of little incidents like that happened this week.
Then, I happened across something that I shouldn't have and it bothered me.
It bothered me a lot and while I can't say what it was, it has played on my mind over and over and I can't reason it out.
It's like I'm obsessed with it and can't really do anything with the information.
I'm not sure I could explain it to anyone even if I could, but it disturbed me and that has been bothering me.So, I've tried not to ask for help when I don't absolutely need it.
I'm frustrated, my husband gets frustrated and then we are at a standstill.
I hate this.I've also had a difficult time doing things on the computer this week.
I just couldn't get things right.
Several people have been kind enough to forward things to me and I wasn't sure that I could get it all down properly so I have waited.
Here are a few things that have been brought to my attention.NPR - National Public Radio -- This week a story aired from StoryCorps.
To learn more about StoryCorps here is a link http://storycorps.org/initiatives/mliIt was developed several years ago for people experiencing memory loss.
It is a way for families to talk with their loved one, share stories of their past and to record a legacy of their life -- among other things.
I have known several people that have taken advantage of this and it is a wonderful program.
This week this story aired http://storycorps.org/listen/stories/robert-patterson-and-his-wife-karenAnother story that ran on NPR was about the early testing for Alzheimer's that has been in the news lately -- I have a related post to that in my blog.
Also, USA Today is working on a big story on this subject and it will be out soon.
The story from this week on NPR is at this link http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=129454412And lastly, I received an email from a gentleman by the name of Norrms and he lives in England.
He has younger on set Alzheimer's and he has a blog and has written a book.
I will admit that I have only glanced over his site, so I can't say much about it at this point.
I intend to spend some more time on it when I can concentrate a little better.
But, his blog address is http://norrms.web.officelive.com/default.aspxI have had several other people contact me this week regarding books, DVD's etc.
and I will try to sort through them soon.
Thanks for reading, thanks for your comments and thanks for your support.

I've mentioned this before but it is so frustrating I could scream.
Twice this week I had a problem shopping and dealing with money.
Everyone knows that I can no longer make change -- and I usually give the clerk a $20 and I get my change back, or I use plastic.
I've been trusting of clerks to give me the correct change, because I couldn't tell you whether they were or they weren't!!!
Anyway, on Monday I went to get my hair trimmed and it was $12.00.
I gave the lady a $20.00 and she gave me $8.00 back.
I decided that I was going to check it -- stupid me.
I kept insisting that she gave me too much money back -- I thought she should have given me $7.00 back -- so I kept giving it back to her and telling her she gave me too much money back -- she was very patient with me and tried to explain several times, counting the money back to me several times.
I became frustrated and she was really patient.
Then I decided that if she insisted that I gave her too much, I must be wrong.
It was so confusing for me.Then today I went to the grocery and although I was using my debit card, I was using coupons.
I didn't think the clerk rang it up correctly with my coupons.
She went over it with me several times and I was holding up the line so I decided not to argue any more.
I'm sure she was right but I can not explain clearly enough what I am trying to say when it comes to the coupons and money off -- it is so simple, yet so hard.
I feel like such a fool.
I don't know why I try -- but sometimes I get that stubborn streak in me that "I am going to figure this out one way or another" -- i usually don't and become even more frustrated.
You think I would have learned by now!

I'm sure many of you have heard about the new article out about using spinal fluid to use as an indicator in diagnosing Alzheimer's.
If not, here is a link to the Alzheimer's Assn.
page that gives their take on it.
http://www.alz.org/news_and_events_statement_regarding_biomarkers.asp.This was an interesting article to me, because eight years ago when I was going through my diagnosis, I actually had this procedure done and these exact things were looked at.
My results showed that I had levels of tau and beta amyloid protein that were "consistent with a diagnosis of Alzheimer's".
A genetic test was also done at the same time and it came back that "this individual possesses an ApoE genotype that indicates with high specificity that Alzheimer's disease is the cause of or a contributor to the observed dementia.
We know that just because one carries this particular gene doesn't mean that you will develop Alzheimer's.
Also, the absence of this gene does not rule out the diagnosis either.We will be hearing much more about this study I'm sure.
I think my neurologist had these tests done on me because I was so young at the time of diagnosis and this was one more tool she could use.
Although during my whole diagnosis the words "Alzheimer's Disease" rarely came up in conversation with the doctor, it was looming in the back of my head the whole time.
And, although I was bracing myself for this diagnosis, to see the lab results come back with the actual words Alzheimer's, caught me off guard.
I was actually seeing some data that said it might be likely.
When I received the results of my neuro-psychological exam it said the same thing, I was still a little rattled.
But all of that is behind me now and we move on.I just thought that these tests were the norm.
But, I do recall talking to others with younger onset Alzheimer's and asking them if they had a spinal tap most of them said no.
I guess we will see what happens with this new information.If we can just work as hard now to find a cure.Thanks to those that have made a donation to the Memory Walk in my behalf.
It's not too late to do so, you can follow this link http://memorywalk2010.kintera.org/faf/donorReg/donorPledge.asp?ievent=335312&lis=1&kntae335312=B3061F795CDC456CB15F2442D5F61337&supId=48686180

Well, the heat has been unbearable here lately.
And, it looks like high 90's and 100's are in the week to come.
Last weekend, we went to a  professional tennis tournament in Atlanta.
It was 96 degrees and on the tennis court it was registering 140 degrees!
We weren't that far from the court, so you can just imagine how hot we were.
After 10 minutes in the stands, our clothes were soaked through.
When we left our seats and came back, you couldn't sit on them they were so hot.
Thank God they were wood, or we would have never been able to sit down.
Ralph poured some water on the wood to try to cool it down and it actually boiled!!
I know the tennis players are in a lot better shape and much younger than I but I don't know how they do it.
One player did have to get an IV of fluids after his match -- I'm thinking others must have as well.
The newspaper said that there were 39 people in the stands that had to have medical attention due to the heat and several were taken to the hospital over the course of the tournament.Yesterday, we played golf but we rented a cart and didn't walk.
It was still hot, but not bad when you are riding in a cart.I've had a couple of "writing assignments" if you will for things for the Alz.
Assn.
lately and they have been really tough for me.
Getting words out (even doing this blog) is getting harder and harder for me to do.
I know what I want to say, I just can't get my thoughs collected enough to put on paper.
It takes way too long to do it.
Thanks to Alan and Jennifer for being my editors on one piece --- it's so frustrating to me.
I think that is why I haven't been posting much, it is just too hard to get the thoughts out in an intelligent way......people already think you are stupid if you have Alzheimer's ......by reading my writing and it not making sense will add fuel to that fire!So, thanks for reading even I don't make sense some time.

Last March when I was in Washington at the Political Action Summit, one of the things we were asking our legislators to do was to sign on to a bill called the Alzheimer's Breakthrough Act as well as the National Alzheimer's Project Act.
These bills basically asked congress to make Alzheimer's a priority and to ask for $2 billion for research.
This week, A bicycle ride is taking place where riders are riding from California to Washington DC to raise awareness for the Alzheimer's Breakthough Act.
I'm asking that you please go to this link and sign the on-line petition to support this legislation.
it doesn't cost you anything but a few minutes of your time.
We are hoping for 50,000 signatures and so far we are at 22,000 -- we need your help and it only takes a minute -- to make a big difference.
Here's the link http://www.alz.org/research/breakthroughride/overview.aspThank you!

The USA Today has an article about a couple dealing with Alzheimer's disease at an early age.
I had the pleasure of getting to know Marilyn and Steve several years ago when we served on an Alzheimer's committee together.
They are a delightful couple and you can read about them here.
http://ee.usatoday.com/SUBSCRIBERS/LandingPage/LandingPage.aspx?href=VVNBLzIwMTAvMDcvMTM.&pageno=Mzc.&entity=QXIwMzcwMQ..&view=ZW50aXR5You are probably seeing a lot about Alzheimer's these days in the news.
The annual International Conference on Alzheimer's Disease (ICAD) is being held this week.

A few weeks ago I told you all about Jan's Story.
A book written by Barry Petersen, a CBS news reporter whose wife has younger on-set Alzheimer's.
It's a wonderful book.
It was a little hard to get through for me because it hit a little too close to home, but it is definitely worth reading.
Barry shares his wife's personality so well, that you think you know her quite well all throughout the book.
I know it must have been hard for him to write it.
A few weeks ago this story aired on CBS Sunday morning.
It's a good introduction to the book.
http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/06/20/sunday/main6600364.shtml?tag=mncol;lst;2I ordered my book through Borders.
But, you can also order it through Amazon.
If you have a loved one that is dealing with Alzheimer's or you yourself are, please take time to read the book.
It might be hard to get through, but you'll be glad you did.

This spring when I went to the Political Action Summit in Washington DC one of the things we were asking our congressional representatives was to support the National Alzheimer's Project Act.
This Act would fund an office being set up within the Office of Health and Human Services to be responsible for coming up with a Plan to fight Alzheimer's and an interagency Advisory Council on Alzheimer's research and Treatment.
Many countries already have an office such as this to coordinate the effects of Alzheimer's disease in their respective countries.
We need this to make Alzheimer's a priority instead of brushing it under the carpet.
You can help.
The link below will send a director message to the Secretary of the Health and human Services agency, Kathleen Sebelius.
You just need to fill in the blanks and hit your send key.
Please take a moment to do this -- it will help everyone!http://www.kintera.org/siteapps/advocacy/ActionItem.aspx?c=mmKXLbP8E&b=6089303

Yesterday, on CBS Sunday Morning, Barry Peterson did a story about his wife dealing with younger onset Alzheimer's.
I can't get the link to work here, but if you go to www.cbsnews.com and click on Sunday morning and the link to "Jan's story" you will see it.
It's wonderful.
I've ordered his book and I'll let you know what I think if I can get through it!

I've been gone awhile -- I can't believe it has been so long since I last posted -- and I said I was going to do better.
We have been to DC to see Jennifer and Alan.
I've posted a few photos.
We did some things that we haven't done before -- we went to the Kennedy Center and saw a concert, went to Wolftrap to see a show, and we went to the Capitol Visitors Center.
I've tried to go there a couple of times and didn't make it.
We had a nice visit.
The first photo was taken from the old Post Office in downtown DC.
We had a beautiful morning with clear skies.
Then two from the Kennedy Center, Alan and Jennifer at the Eastern Market on Capitol Hill, Ralph and I at the Visitor's Center and the last photo taken on the Washington monument as we were paddle boating in the Tidal Basin.
Thanks to Jennifer and Alan for their hosptality.
I did o.k on the trip.
Crossing the streets in large cities is a problem for me but I always had someone with me.
And, we had a harrowing experience getting to the airport in time for our flight -- 10 more  minutes and we would have missed it.
Then on the way back we had our planed delayed four hours.
It is always something traveling these days isn't it?
We returned to hot hot weather here in the south.
We played golf this morning and I don't know what I was thinking!!!
I guess I wasn't -- my concentration was pretty poor and I did awful.
And, it was really too hot to play......but like idiots we did.

I hope everyone had a good Memorial Day.
Thanks to all that have served our country!I was watching more tennis over the weekend and did a little better with keeping up with things.
A UGA woman won the national singles championship so we were happy about that.I actually went out and hit the tennis ball with my husband last week.
I haven't been playing because of my balance issues, but after watching so much I wanted to get out and hit some.
We weren't able to actually play a game, but I did o.k.
considering my limitations.
It was nice to "feel" like I was actually playing again -- I miss it a lot.On another note, I received notice about a new clinical study that is getting started.
It is actually a continuation of one that has just completed.
But, due to some extra grants, this study is going to go further.
It's intent is to try to help determine changes in the brain early -- to help diagnose Alzheimer's earlier in patients.
I'm going to post a link for more information.
In Georgia, Emory University is a site for this trial, but according to the website they are not recruiting volunteers yet.
But, there is information on this link for you to get in touch with them (and any other areas where the trial is being run).
http://adcs.org/Studies/ImagineADNI.aspx or you can call the Alzheimer's Disease Education and Referral Center (ADEAR) at 1-800-438-4380.
As always, I'm not endorsing this study, I'm just passing it along to those that might be interested.
They are not only looking for people with early memory loss but healthy volunteers as well.

As I said in my last post, the NCAA men's and women's tennis tournament is currently in Athens.
I've been going every day.
As someone who has played tennis all her life, I can appreciate the way these college students play since I'll never be able to play that way!
It's been hot out there watching -- it was in the 90's all day yesterday.
But, it is tiring sitting there for four or five hours at a stretch.
Last night going on about the fourth hour of watching the tennis I realized my brain was so tired that I couldn't follow what was going on and I couldn't keep track of the score.
I was looking at the scoreboard but it didn't make sense to me.
I had to ask my husband which numbers I needed to look at.....sad -- very sad -- for me.

A few random thoughts --The University of Georgia has been hosting the men's and women's national tennis championships the last few days.
Action will continue for about the next week or so.
I've been going to some of the matches.
This year, the noise of the crowd (yes, tennis crowds can get loud) has been bothering me.
The first day I forgot my ear plugs, but you can be sure I had them the following days.One bit of class I saw yesterday was that the Virginia men's team that was playing had on patches that honored the Virginia Lacrosse player that was murdered a few weeks.
What a nice touch --The CBS Early Morning show ran a three part series on Alzheimer's this week.
I couldn't copy and paste the proper address here for some reason, but if you go to www.cbsnews.com and search for Alzheimer's they will come up.
Important information.Also, I'd like to say best of luck to Kate Gordon at the Public Policy office for the Alzheimer's Association.
She's leaving the office in Washington DC to work for the Institute on Aging -- she'll still be a help to us in her new capacity.
Kate was a joy to work with and someone I consider a friend.
She was always there for you when you needed her -- and she still will be.
You'll be missed Kate!

to all of you that have sent emails to me lately, wondering about my whereabouts on this blog.
Sorry I haven't written -- I'm here.
Just having a problem getting my thoughts in order and typing them out.
I seem to have a problem lately with getting my thoughts organized and out whether they are in written or verbal form.
I went to the neurologist last week and he told me that he thought that I had gotten a little worse in my "delayed speech pattern".
Which basically meant that I was having a hard time getting my words out.
I told him I thought so too, but then he looked at me and said, "you know, there isn't anything I can do for you".
Which although I know that is true, it's hard to hear sometimes.It's frustrating for me when I can have whole conversations in my head that I want to have with someone, but I can't get the words out.My husband has been gone for about a week.
He's home today.
I know I have said it before, that when he is away and I am home alone, it is so much easier on me.
He knows this too so I'm not saying anything out of line.
I am amazed at how much easier it is -- not from the physical things I usually do like cleaning, cooking and dishes, but mentally.
I find that I can stay up longer at night because I'm not as mentally tired from having someone around all the time.
And I get much more stressed when my husband is around, not sure what that is all about, but I would probably be stressed with anyone around --that isn't aimed at him!
My husband doesn't talk much, but he is a pacer -- he paces all over the house during the day.
I'll be in one room trying to "do my own thing" and he will come in there many many times during his pacing.
Each time it interrupts what I am doing and although he says he doesn't want anything, it's still an interruption in my brain.
It's amazing how these little things will get to me.
And, of course, the noise is an issue -- which it gets worse and worse.
I think I might have had the television set on a total of about 5 or 6 hours during the entire time he was gone.
Counter that with the almost non-stop television set being on when he is home, it sure makes a difference.
He is getting better about wearing earphones with the televsion set, but it is still bothersome.
A friend of mine with AD, just had some custom made ear plugs made that he says blocks out all the noise except for conversations.
He says he can ride in the car with his wife with the radio on and not hear the radio but he can hear her when she talks.
I might look into that.
We have finished converting my son's old bedroom into a "quiet room" for me and it has certainly been a great place for me to go to achieve some peach and quiet.On another note, my friend Carol and I went to Macon last week to an Alzheimer's fundraiser with the band Diamond Rio.
It was lots of fun to be away together and the concert was really nice.
Thanks Carol -- for being my chaueffer and most of all my friend for all these years -- Sainthood might be up there for you too!
Carol will certainly understand this.

They always say - it's not how old you look, but how young you feel, right?
Well, how come it aggravates me to no end, that when I go grocery shopping on Wednesdays, they always give me the senior citizen discount, when it doesn't apply to me!!!!
It's just the principle of the thing.

Sorry for not posting lately.
I've been kind of down in the dumps and haven't really felt like writing.
And, the southern pollen has been getting to me so I haven't fell that well either.
We are making a few adjustments around the house and my husband has been painting -- he doesn't like me helping so I can't say that I have contributed alot.
But, we'll soon be able to post photos and then my son can see what we have done to his room!On another sad note, some family friends had a tragedy in their family last night.
Their 28 year old son (who is autistic) shot his two sisters and his mother yesterday, fatally wounding one sister who had just given birth to a baby girl a week ago.
It is so tragic.
Please pray for them.

Here are some photos of my cards and some scrapbook pages for the women's basketball team.
I sell my cards and all the proceeds go to our Alzheimer's Association Memory Walk.
These are just a few examples, I do all sorts and take requests!

I know I haven't posted in quite awhile.
I don't have any excuses really -- just been busy doing spring cleaning and trying to clean and organize my crafting area in my house.
That takes so long.
My "therapy" for lack of a better word is scrapbooking and making cards.
I scrap a book for one of the UGA women's basketball players, and since the season is just ending there is a lot of catching up to do to get the book ready to give my player, Christy Marshall.
Christy is a senior and unfortunately due to an ACL injury was not able to play her senior year, but I still did a scrapbook and hopefully, in the years to come she will enjoy it.
I also had lots of Easter cards to make -- like I said -- it's therapy.
I hope to post some photos of some of the pages I have done shortly.We had a nice Easter -- friends came over for dinner.
Everyone brought something so there wasn't much for me to do.We have already gotten summer weather here -- it has been in the high 80's the last couple of days -- suppose to be more "normal" by weeks end.Lots of Alzheimer's stuff going on but will need to save that for another post.
Just didn't realize how long it had been since I wrote something, so I wanted to at least add a few words today.

Well, I'm back -- tired but back.
The trip was really good -- weather was great and we had a good group from Georgia that went.
In all we had 8 people from several congressional districts with us.
Our goal was to go to Capitol Hill and ask our leigslatures for increased money for research, a coordinated plan to deal with Alzheimer's nationwide and a better way to improve detection, diagnosis and care planning.
Rep. David Scott had already signed on for these things and when we returned we got word that Sen. Chambliss had signed on to the bill representing a coordinated plan to deal with Alzheimer's.
We met with Representative John Lewis and he was the most gracious man to us.
What a civil rights pioneer he has been and it was a pleasure to meet him.
He is also very supportive of what the Alzheimer's Association is doing and gives us his complete support.
I'll post some more photos next week -- I'm collecting them from other members that went with us.
Thanks to Ginny and Kathy in the state office for setting up interviews and to the national office for putting this together.I have posted one photo on top though.
This photo was taken from Rep. Lewis' office -- rather breathtaking isn't it?
The reason I am posting it is that to the right (the round corner building) is the building my son works in.
I was going to walk from the Capitol over to meet him for lunch and to meet the judge he works for.
I've mentioned the fact before that I have a problem crossing the street -- there are too many visual signals that confuse me.
But, I didn't really think much about it when going to see Alan.
I walked about 10 minutes from the Capitol and got down to the intersection you see in the photo near that building and I didn't know what to do.
I couldn't cross the street.
There were a few people milling around but they weren't much help.
I thought about calling Alan but he said that he would come down to meet me so I didn't have to go through security twice.
So, I stood on the sidewalk and waited for him.
He finally emerged from the office building and started walking across the street toward me so I walked toward him.
I feel so stupid not being able to do this, but it's just one of those quirky things.
I wouldn't have attempted to do that if I knew that he wasn't going to be on the other end.
I travelled alone to Washington DC but Alan and Jennifer picked me up at the airport and got me to the hotel just fine.
I got to meet many folks that I have been corresponding through email or through this blog at the conference.
That is always great to be able to put a face to an email address.Diane -- you asked about a scholarship -- I did get a scholarship from national and our state office to attend.
I wouldn't have gone without it.I will write more about the conference and add some more photos next week.
Thanks for reading.

I'm in DC for the Alzheimer's Political Action Summit.
Last night we had a candlelight vigil and David Hyde Pierce was there.
We had 11,000 people also join us at the Lincoln Memorial on line through the virtual candlelight vigil as well.
Alan and Jennifer joined us and Jennifer shot this group shot and then someone got a shot of them with the Washington Monument behind them.
Today we had a luncheon that honored Social Security Commissioner Astrue for his work on adding Early On Set Alzheimer's to the Compassionate Care Allowance.
It's been a good meeting so far -- we are off to Capitol Hill for talks with our legislatures tomorrow,

<doc date=Wednesday, March 03, 2010>
It's been a busy time -- we just returned from Florida, and I'm headed to Atlanta for a few days and then off to DC to the Political Action Summit the Alzheimer's Association is having.
I'm doing it pretty much alone (traveling alone) but since my wonderful son in Washington DC I know he will look out for me.
I need to remember to pace myself though as I get so tired so quickly.I'm anxious to get to DC to see many of my Alzheimer's friends -- I "talk" to them a lot over email but it will be nice to see everyone and see how they are doing.
And, the staff is so great and accommodating that it will be nice to see them as well.
Our state delegation will be heading to Capitol Hill on Tuesday to see our legislators and to ask for more money for research.
There is so much more to be done.
I'll try to post while I'm away.

We just returned from a few days in Florida -- where it was nice and warm -- in the low 80's.
We returned and this morning it was 24 degrees outside!We first went to Gainesville where we saw our beloved Lady Bulldogs lost to the University of Florida in basketball.
A disappointing loss to say the least.Then we headed about four hours south and went to Ft. Myers.
My first cousin Laura and Ken live there six months out of the year (the other six months in Wisconsin).
I hadn't seen them for many years and we decided that since we were that far south we would go the extra miles and visit.
We had a great time and I want to thank them so much for showing us around and being so gracious with their time.
A few photos are posted on top -- Ralph and I by a banyon tree on the grounds of Thomas Edison's estate in Ft. Myers along with a few other photos from there.
We also went out to Captiva Island and Sannibel Island.
The homes there were gorgeous -- it kind of reminded me of a cross between Martha's Vineyard and Hilton Head!
Several things I saw there that I had never seen were a cinnamon tree and an allspice tree.
I guess I never knew those spices grew on a tree -- had never really given it much thought but was surprised by them.
Thanks again to Ken and Laura for our royal treatment!
Another thing, I went to Florida with only one of my two Alzheimer's medications -- I forgot them -- imagine that.
I did ok since it was only a couple of days, but I'm glad I wasn't alone!

I spoke last night to a really nice group of women at the local Pilot Club.
The work with a program called Project Lifesaver International.

Well, I'm glad I'm not living in DC like my son and daughter-in-law.
I am too old for all that snow -- having been a former midwesterner I've "been there done that".
But I told my son that he will be able to tell his grandchildren about this storm.
My daughter in law Jennifer has taken some beautiful photos of the snow and I have posted a few here.
The government has been shut down again today -- but Alan has still been going to work.

Well, since I last wrote, I've been to Starkville MS and Auburn Alabama for two UGA women's basketball games.
Unfortunately we lost both of them, but after returning late last night from one of the games, I don't want to talk about it!
We will definitely have better days!When I went to Auburn, we went on a bus trip with other booster club members.
This is usually fun and I won't say it wasn't fun -- i just didn't enjoy it as much and not because we lost.
My intention was to get there early enough to get in the front or the back of the bus because of the noise.
I knew that if I was sitting in the middle that I would be bombarded by noise coming at me from all angles.
Well, my best laid plans as they say didn't work out.
I was right in the middle.
I did have my earplugs which were a godsend, but I was still not comfortable and was only hoping the bus driver would go faster and faster to get there.
We stopped for lunch and I chose not to eat in the restaurant because it was too noisy so I got a little break from it.
Coming back wasn't as bad, because we were coming back late and because the crowd was a little more subdued because we lost.
I'm not sure if I'll be doing that trip again.Next Monday -- we are off to the capitol  in Atlanta for Alzheimer's Awareness Day.
Hopefully we will have a good turnout.

I know I haven't written in a long time.
Sorry about that -- couldn't think of much to say.
The Public Policy Forum is coming up soon in Washington -- you can get more information at www.alz.org.
I guess they are callingit Action Summit this year -- anyway -- I have some conflicting things going on and I'm trying to make it work.
Please let me know if any of you that read this are going so if I decide to go we can meet up.I'm off to Starkville Mississippi in an hour or so to see our UGA Women's basketball team play a game there.
I promise I will write more tomorrow when I return.

I know I wrote about this book back in December -- but it is now in book stores and I want you to read this book!
Gary Reiswig writes about Alzheimer's in his family and it is not only heartbreaking, it is real and from the heart.
Everyone needs to read this -- we have to find a cure for everyone -- and especially for families like Gary's.
Gary's research reveals a lot and you get a chance to read some things about Alzheimer's that you normally don't have access to.
He has done all the work -- please take some time to read this book.
If you can't find Thousand Mile Stare at your bookstore, go to the website and order it -- you won't be sorry.

In case you missed the segment on CBS News last night here it is http://www.alz.org/news_and_events_18498.asp -- worth watching.Someone asked if the February 8th day at the Capitol was Awareness Day -- and it is for Georgia but not nationwide -- the nationwide event is usually in November if I remember correctly -- and that's saying a lot!
</doc>
<doc date=Friday, January 08, 2010>
I know I haven't posted in awhile -- hope everyone made it through the holidays o.k.Wanted to bring your attention to a few Alzheimer's related things coming up -- On Tuesday, January 12th the CBS Evening News with Katie Couric will air a 6 minute segment on Alzheimer's entitled "Where American Stands on Alzheimer's".
A three generation family will be interviewed with two the generations diagnosed with the disease.
I hope you will tune in to watch and let CBS know how much we appreciate them airing it!February 8th is Alzheimer's Awareness Day at the Capitol in Atlanta.
We need everyone there -- here is a link to the Georgia Chapter's site for more information.
Please make plans now to attend.

I worry about memories -- I know they are going to become more distant to me.
I was thinking about this over the weekend -- we were telling Alan and Jennifer what we used to do before they were born -- i.e.
make pizza dough from scratch, not use shortcuts while preparing dinner, etc.
But, today, I was cleaning out some things from Alan's bedroom and I ran across something Alan did in the 6th grade -- it is his "autobiography".
You can just imagine if he did it in the sixth grade how interesting it is!!!
I had to take time out of cleaning and sit down and read it.
I laughed....I cried.....I realized how much I didn't remember......I understood how important some little things we used to do were to Alan.....and I actually saw a glimpse of the man he is today.
I'll keep this forever -- what a treat to find.

My brother gave me new skates for Christmas so I had to try them out.
Alan and I went skating in Atlanta today and then visited with Jennifer's family.
I'm posting a few photos from our outing, some at Jen's house and a final photo of Alan, Ralph and I before he left for DC.
Alan gave me a nice gift certificate to a spa for Christmas so I'll be able to enjoy that soon -- but I promise no photos of that! 
</doc>
<doc date=Saturday, December 26, 2009>
I'll post some more photos soon but wanted to get this one up.
We had dinner with some friends yesterday and this photo was snapped by their tree.
Unfortunately, our beautiful daughter-in-law was in transit from Washington DC to Atlanta at the time this photo was taken.
Hope everyone had a great holiday!
</doc>
<doc date=Tuesday, December 22, 2009>
to everyone.
I've been a bit stressed out this week so needless to say it hasn't been a good week for me.
I guess it is anticipation of the holidays, Alan being home and all the "extra stuff" around the house.
Had major panic attacks while out trying to run some errands this week -- too many people for me and I was out later than I usually am.
Have to stick to that routine you know.But, I haven't really planned much while Alan is home and he won't be home that long, so it won't be much of a problem.
I have help if I need it and knowing that makes it easier.I do wish everyone a great holiday season.
I've enjoyed getting your cards and letters at this time of the year-- I really love hearing what is going on with everyone.Have a great one!

My son and daughter-in-law got to see a lot of snow yesterday -- with the big storm that hit DC.
I know it was a record one for the area -- and the largest snow amount they have ever seen.
Jennifer takes great photos so I thought I would share a few on this site -- thanks Jennifer.
I'm sure there will be lots of snowman building today.
One thing about the south is, snowmen don't melt, they deflate!

Yesterday was a long day.
It started by helping the UGA Women's Basketball team put together bicycles for underprivileged children here in Athens.
There was a potluck lunch to go with it.
After that, we attended a charity tennis event that featured Serena Williams, Joshn Isner, Sam Querry and Melanie Oudin.
That event was over 3 and half hours long.
It was really drawn out.
After having the first event, by a few hours into the second event I was long gone mentally.
I was so tired, I wasn't sure who was serving or even who was playing at that point.
Just too much for me in one day.
Thought I could make it, but obviously didn't do so well with it.
Some photos are above -- oh -- NeNe from the Housewives of Atlanta is also pictured.
She sat right in front of us and lots of people were coming up to get their photo taken with her and to get her autograph -- really distracting I might add.

It is always sad to lose someone, but especially during the holidays.
Right around Christmas my friend, Kathy, who I visited with in Cape Cod this summer, lost her sister.
Maureen, to cancer.
Her sister lived in Peoria where we grew up.
She was diagnosed and several weeks later lost her life.
I guess it is comforting to know that Maureen didn't suffer.Right after I returned home this week, a long time school friend and friend of the family died.
He went to school with my brother and had been ill for awhile.
He suffered a stroke and had many complications after that.
He was only in his mid-50's.
Doug was a fire batallion chief with the Peoria fire department.
Today, after his funeral there will be a long processional of firemen that worked under him and others around the area.
A great tribute to a great young man.And, then, a few days ago another friend passed away here in Athens -- only 58 years old.
His daughter was Alan's first girlfriend in high school and they have remained close.
We visited with his daughter who now lives in NYC when we were there for the US Open.
It was such a shame to lose him -- he was very prominent in the UGA music department and his accomplishments outside of teaching were enormous.
I'm much more emotional now than I used to be and these have hit me hard -- perhaps because they were all around my age -- you just never know.
Rest in peace my friends.

Well, I cut my trip short by a day because of the big storm that was heading toward the midwest.
I'm glad I did because most of the flights have been cancelled for today.
I was ready to come home.
While there I had an infection and had to go to the emergency room for treatment.
Not fun, but manageable.
When I went to the airline counter to change my ticket the lady told me I looked a little "frazzled and panicky" -- I told her I just needed to get home.
I hurried to put stuff in my bag so we could get to the airport and everything was kind of moving a little too fast for me.
When I reached Atlanta there were lots of thunderstorms so by the time I drove 1 1/2 hours to the house I was tired.
I had a hard time concentrating and I went to take my pills and mistakenly took the morning pills instead of the evening pills.
Unfortunately, their is one pill I take in the morning that causes insomnia -- so I was up most of the night.
But, I had a good visit with friends and family.
My brother is holding his own.
I met with my friends Pody and Rick from Champaign and Joe and Rita who used to live here in Athens.
Pictured above are my friends Pody and Rick, me with my great nephew Oliver (isn't he cute?)
and my two brothers.
More soon -- after I have rested!

I hope everyone had a great Thanksgiving.
We just returned from Washington DC and spending four days with Alan and Jennifer.
We had a great time.
I didn't have to cook the turkey -- Jen did a great job with that.
We got to go ice skating and many of you know how I like to ice skate so that was a lot of fun.
In the photos I was trying to teach Alan and Jen how to skate backwards -- Jen did great -- it was a little lost on Alan.
But, we didn't manage to mow any little kids over (get that Carol?)
and it was a beautiful day that day so I really enjoyed it.
Since Ralph broke his elbow the last time we went ice skating he was not allowed to take the ice!
We also went to Annapolis for a day to visit the Naval Academy.
The town itself is so pretty and it was really impressive.
We also visiting the Air Force memorial, the Marine Corps Memorial and the National Botanic Garden where there were lots of Christmas decorations out.
In the top photo you will see one of the miniature landmarks done with all natural materials -- berries, nuts, acorns, twigs, leaves, etc.
There were several on display including the Washington Monument, the Lincoln Memorial, Jefferson Memorial, Supreme Court and others.
There were also trains running around the buildings and the rest of the decorations.
I did pretty well on this trip -- but there wasn't much expected of me.
I just enjoyed myself and thanks to Alan and Jennifer for keeping us out of trouble, going skating with me and cooking all the food!I'm off to Illinois at the end of the week to visit my family -- more soon.

Good morning to all!
I know it has been awhile -- don't have any excuse, just not in the mood to sit down and write.
I felt pretty anxious all week and don't really know why.
One day I had a hard time leaving the house -- in fact, I'm not sure I did!
We are driving to DC this week to visit Alan and Jennifer for Thanksgiving.
Although we just saw them at the end of August I'm glad to be seeing them again.I hope we get to go ice skating -- and no, we are not going to let Ralph put on skates!!
!Our Georgia women's basketball team plays the mighty Rutgers team today.
I've always been a fan of their coach C. Vivian Stringer, although I'm a bigger fan of our coach, Andy Landers.
It should be a good game.
We beat ranked Oklahoma last week so here's hoping for the best.
The Georgia football team didn't look so good against Kentucky last night.
Not pretty.

is a book that is going to be published in January 2010.
It's a true story about a man and his family that have been dealing with Alzheimer's in their family for generations.
He has been spared from this disease, but he watches members of his family suffer.
I've had the opportunity to review the book and it is one you will want to read.....you can preorder it now at http://www.thethousandmilestare.com/.
Gary's cousin Chuck has been active with the Alzheimer's Association as someone who is living with the disease.
Chuck's grandmother went to Washington DC years ago to talk with legislatures about Alzheimer's and it has come full circle with Chuck as he has done the same thing -- talked in front of a Senate Subcommittee to increase funding for Alzheimer's research.
The story of the family is heartwrenching but beautifully told by Gary Reiswig.
Order it now for a holiday gift -- but get out the tissues because it will tug at your heart.

My husband likes to "tinker" with things.
It drives me crazy because there are certain things he just can't leave alone.
When he wants to change things he just does, without consulting me of course.
And, since change is a problem for me, this creates problems.He recently changed our Cable television service.
Which means a new remote.
Since he is the "king of the remote" (what man isn't though!)
this creates a problem for me because "I'm not doing it right" or "you don't know how to use it" is muttered quite frequently in our house.
I try -- but when you don't get an opportunity to even touch the remote most of the time, it is hard to learn -- let alone learning something new.Then, my husband upgraded our computer from Vista to Windows 7.
Which I know is an improvement -- but it is something else to learn.
Things aren't in the same place I'm used to them being.
Then my husband decided to install several new programs that he wanted to use.
One of the problems with that was that when he installed this one of these programs, it would not allow me to turn the sound off on the computer.
(I can't deal with the sounds coming from the computer -- it sounds silly, but I lose my concentration).
After complaining my husband finally took it off the computer until he could talk with it's maker and find out what the problem was.
But, many times, when he makes one slight change in something -- it changes other things that affect me -- and because they are "little things" to most people, he doesn't seem to think it is a big deal -- but those little things are big things to me.
It is very frustrating.
So, the last few weeks I have been confused.
As a result, I get confused about a lot of things and I get anxious about that because things are not "normal" -- they've changed.
I say the definition of normal changes all the time for me so I guess writing that last sentence doesn't make much sense -- but it is frustrating.
I just feel like I'm a few steps behind everyone else.
I need my space, my quiet and all things to stay the same......I know that is too much to ask for.....especially in my household.
I've tried to explain that it would be like going into someone's house who was blind and moving all the furniture around without telling them.
(or at least that is what I think it would be like)  Little things make a difference in the life of someone with Alzheimer's.

I've been in Atlanta for a couple of days so no posting.
I was hoping I would have a photo of our MW team from this weekend to post but not yet.
Thanks again to my whole team for coming out in the rain and walking.
I appreciate it!Monday night I had the privilege to speak once again to Dr. Glass' gerontology class at UGA.
Dr. Glass and I met by chance one day while riding a shuttle to the Atlanta airport.
Since then, she has been gracious to allow me to come and speak with her class.
I've said it before and I'll say it again, that it is also therapy for me to do that.
It is interesting to see who is in her class and their take on Alzheimer's.
Thanks for having me!I've also been reading an advance copy of a  book about familial Alzheimer's.
A person I know with Younger On Set Alzheimer's has a cousin who is writing this book about the disease and it's affect on their family.
Many family members have (or had) the disease and it is gut wrenching to think about.
Gary's book is due out in January and I will certainly write more about it as it gets close to its debut.
It is certainly worth reading.

Well, the rain didn't stay away -- we all got drenched but we raised a lot of money and everyone seemed to take the rain in stride.
It was ideal by any means but it was very heartwarming to me that people really came out in the rain and supported us.
That is something I really can't express in words how meaningful that was to me.Our Team, Team Athens raised roughly $15,000 and I couldn't be happier.
I have a great group of team members and they are near and dear to my heart!

It's Memory Walk Day -- I'm up early trying to double check everything.
It's cold -- in the 40's and isn't suppose to get much warmer and currently it is raining outside.
That is not even showing on the weather radar so I'm not sure what is up with that.
Thanks to all who have contributed.
More after the Walk.
</doc>
<doc date=Friday, October 09, 2009>
was a little hectic but I survived.
Next weekend is Memory Walk -- so we'll be in overdrive until that happens I suppose.
I heard from many friends this week and that is always nice.
I wish I could spend more time with my friends and that is something I'm going to work on.
There's never enough time to do the things we want, but it seems like we make time for some things -- I'm going to try to make more time with my friends.I've made a few new friends this week as well.
It's funny how you can meet some people and know instantly that they will become a good friend.
My birthday was this week and husband came up withs ome ways to remind me of my advancing age.
My son pointed out that it was time to change my profile since I was no longer 53.........but I can say, that seven years ago when I was diagnosed with Alzheimer's I didn't think I would make it to 53 hearing about all the gloom and doom coming our way.
And while that gloom and doom is still out there I can't let it get to me -- I just have to keep going......probably not as good as the Energizer bunny but going just the same.

I have a busy week ahead.
So much going on I can't just rely on my calendar to get by -- yesterday I had to sit down and write everything down for every day so I wouldn't get confused.
Usually I can go by a huge calendar we have in our kitchen for everything, but not this week.
I feel better now that I have everything written down and Ralph has kind of checked it over.
I wasn't so good about "scheduling" myself this week and the next for that matter.Yesterday was a bad "word day", but I started doing something yesterday that I have never done.....like spell words backwards when I was typing -- now I can't do that in the doctor's office when they give me that little mini-mental test so I don't know why I am doing it now.
It has taken me a very long time to write this entry.
Not only was I spelling words backwards (and most of the time getting them right!)
I didn't know I was doing it until I read back what I was writing.
And, then sometimes I was writing a word like "doing" and writing "goind" instead -- interchanging the first and last letters.
Pretty bazaar -- maybe I can just say I can't type!

Well, it had stopped raining but today is another wash out.
Not real great for the home Georgia Football game tonight.My husband decided to change our cable subscription and with it came a new remote control for our television set.
I could hardly work the old one -- now I have to learn this one.
It makes me a little anxious just touching it so hopefully he will be patient with me -- new things are difficult!I've been getting lots of requests to repost things on my blog so I'm going to do a few -- one is http://1mtweets.com/ -- this is a site for those that Twitter -- which I don't -- to remember a loved one with Alzheimer's.
They are trying to get one million tweets.Someone else has asked some questions regarding on going clinical trials.
Here is a link for the most current clinical trials I know of http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=alzheimer%27sJeanette sent this link to a device she invented to leave her mother messages.
She cares for her mother with Alzheimer's and wanted her to be able to hear her voice during the day.
I don't really know much more about it than what this link shows, and I'm not endorsing it, just passing the information along if you are interested http://www.kindreminder.com/.We're preparing for our Memory Walk which is in a few weeks.
For those that have contributed thank you -- if you still want to contribute see the link to the right.

I'm sure many of you have seen the news with all the rain we have been receiving down here.
It is much worse in Atlanta.
We have seen a little over 7 inches here in Athens over the last couple of days.
But it is still raining and we are in for a few more days of it.
Many of the Atlanta school systems have shut down because of the flooding and six people have lost their lives.
We haven't had this much rain in a very long time -- when we have it has been related to a hurricane in the southeast.
So, this was obviously unexpected.
Thanks to all those that have called or emailed asking about the situation down here.

I haven't written for awhile I know.
I've had a cold and I've been extremely tired -- so not motivated is a good way to put it.Our trip to New York was really nice.
I was confused a lot of the time -- too much visual stimulation I think, as well as too many people!
But, I survived and did the best I could.
When I get in large crowds I have to hold on to someone -- I know that sounds silly -- but it helps me get by.
My husband doesn't like holding my hand (God forbid I would touch him in public), so when I am with him I have to try to hold on to his arm or his shirt or something.
And, he walks really slow so I get aggravated.
When I am with my son, he walks fast and doesn't mind holding his mom's hand, so it was nice to be with him and get his assistance.
I really get confused crossing the street -- this sounds silly too -- but I can't take my cue from other people because they cross when they are not suppose to -- so you have people walking across both sides of the street at the same time.
When I look at the crosswalk signal I get confused, because at the same time I can see a green light so I'm not sure if I am suppose to cross or not -- and the crosswalk signs are different in each city so I get confused.
Little things I know -- but little things make a difference.
Going out to the US Open the subways were really crowded and I managed to have a really bad trip one day -- but I got through.
I knew it was going to be a problem, and anticipating the problem helps, because I can try to help myself as much as I can and those that are with me can help me too.
A lot of people ask me how I can go to sporting events when there are so many people at them -- my response to that is that in most cases, people have a seat and are sitting in it -- it's not like I have all these people standing around me -- there is some sense of order to it.
I'm not in the middle of it -- and I know what to expect --I think the surprises catching me off guard makes things worse.But, I'm glad I went.
I have been wanting to go to the Open for along time.
The facility and grounds were beautiful.
We got  to watch some great tennis.
I'm glad we were not there the second weekend as the rain was a real problem.
The weather was almost perfect for us and made the trip more pleasing.
Plus, I got time to spend with Alan and with his wife Jennifer.
She could only stay a few days with us because she had to get back to DC but I don't talk to her much and I hadn't seen her since Christmas so I was glad to spend some time with her.
When I'm with Alan we always laugh so much -- I miss that -- we don't laugh around our house much -- which is really a shame when you think about it.Alan starts a new job today -- he left his law firm and is going to do a two year clerkship with Judge Kollar Kotelly in the DC circuit.
He's really looking forward to it and it will be a great experience for him.
They are also moving into another apartment this month so a few changes for them this month.

<doc date=Tuesday, September 08, 2009>
I'm still recuperating from my trip -- I'm still exhausted.
I'm either getting a cold or suffering from my allergies which doesn't help.
The trip was great but I could never have done it alone -- I'm glad my family was with me.
The crowds got the best of me a few times.
But I survived -- it was great being with my son.
We laugh so much when we are together and I really miss that.
Alan always has a smile on his face and it is very refreshing.
Our daughter-in-law Jennifer was with us for a few days and I had not seen her since Christmas so it was nice spending a few days with her as well.On another note -- World Alzheimer's Day is September 21st.
I have been getting some requests to post some sites you might want to check out.
One is "memories matter" -- this is a site in the UK which lets you post memories of your loved one with Alzheimer's -- or your memories if you have the disease.
The link to it is http://www.memories-matter.org/.
I have also heard from David Wasser from Retirement Living TV -- they are running a documentary on September 21st about Alzheimer's.
I'm not sure I get that channel but the link to their site is www.rl.tv.
There are some previews of the show there.
Hopefully, we will see a lot in the news about Alzheimer's and take advantage of this day.

We just returned from five days in NYC.
We went for the US Open Tennis tournament.
Alan and Jennifer came up from Washington DC to meet us, although Jennifer couldn't stay but a few days.
Going to the US Open was something that Alan and I had been wanting to do for some time but the timing wasn't right with his school and his work, but we made it work this year.
The experience was great and it was one of those things that you were glad you went.
The crowds got to me and a few other things but I survived.
More on the trip later -- just wanted to post these photos.
Jennifer and Ralph took these photos.

Our Memory Walk is in about 6 weeks -- can't believe it is coming up so quickly.
We are having it at a different venue so it is takinga  little more planning than usual.
Luckily, some sponsors have come in.....our goal is to raise $75,000 -- with the economy it is going to be hard, but we are optimistic!I'll be away from the computer for a few days and I know I haven't posted for awhile....but I'm going to try to do better come September!

Thanks for your emails and comments about my "meltdown".
I'm still bothered by it -- I hate that it happened.
To Lee in Illinois -- I have not had a yoga class but my doctors have taught me how to get out of it and I'm pretty good at it.
Most of the time I start hyper-ventilating at the same time, so it is important for me to get my breathing under control.
I have a brown paper bag I carry in my purse to breathe into, but since I was on the golf course I didn't have my purse.
But, even though I could get out of the panic attacks, I felt that it was best to get off the course and get home -- I feel "safer" at home.
If that makes any sense.

Well, I tried.
Today I went to go play golf.
I haven't played in a couple of weeks and with my new medication for concentration I was doing pretty well.
My husband and two guys that have retired from where he worked usually make up our foursome.
The last time they played without me they played from the red tees -- which is the ladies tee and the "seniors" tee.
Usually they play from the white tees which are little farther back from the red tee.
Anyway, today they decided to play from my tees.Although, I couldn't handle it.
I started having panic attacks on the second hole, because it "wasn't right" -- it wasn't my normal routine.
I thought I could work through it but I couldn't -- I hit two shots straight into the woods and then had such panic attack I thought I was going to die because I couldn't get my breath.
Then, when I did catch my breath I just sat down on the cart path and started crying.
I couldn't get it together -- things were "off" and I couldn't concentrate and I couldn't get it together.
After calming down a little I decided to come back home, I knew that I couldn't go on.Such little things can throw you off and it is so frustrating that I have to live this way.

I know I haven't posted for awhile.
I'm still dealing with a sore tooth -- even after my root canal.
I'm not sure it will ever feel better.
I go back to the dentist next week and hopefully, at some point, I will be able to chew on that side.I'm also still getting used to the medicine the doctor put me on for my concentration.
It is helping I will say, but it does take some getting used to.
It's a good thing......just different.
It certainly has helped my concentration on the golf course if nothing else!We are planning a trip to NYC in a few weeks.
Alan is going to meet us up there and hopefully, if Jennifer can get the time off she will as well.
We have tickets for the US Open Tennis Tournament.
It's something Alan and I have always wanted to do but the timing was never right.
I guess the "stars alignned" and we were able to pull it off this year -- barring any unforseen circumstances.
Since I've been to NYC many times, I am hoping I won't have many problems.
Since it is the week before Labor Day the crowds might still be up but I will just have to deal with them the best I can at that point I guess.
I won't be alone and I can always go back to the hotel to rest if need be.
Since I have been so many times, there isn't a lot I haven't seen in NY.
Alan also has many friends in the NYC area that he can catch up with while he is there.
I've been busy with Memory Walk -- trying to get my part organized.
That has been a lot harder for me this year.
Just having to make lots and lots more notes and lists.The clutter around the house has been getting to me as well -- not that there is a lot to it but it makes me nervous.
So, I have been systematically going from room to room and organizing and cleaning it.
I'm sure that I will put things places and forget where they are -- but oh well -- it won't be the first time!

<doc date=Sunday, August 02, 2009>
I know that I have said this before -- that when I was first diagnosed with Alzheimer's that my friends (and family) were the most important things to me.
Unfortunately, some friends that I thought were friends, really weren't friends because they went running to the hills when they found out about my diagnosis.
I learned a lot from that.But a few months a friend from my hometown passed away.
We had gone to elementary school and high school together.
Word of his death hit me very hard although it had probably been over 25 years since I had seen him.
He was quite successful in business as I think we all knew he would be.
He was every kid's friend and I don't think I ever heard anyone say anything bad about him.
I've recently tried to reach out to some of my old classmates through Facebook and "talking" with them via Facebook I learned that they too were hit hard by his death.
I guess that speaks volumes about him as a person.
I'm sorry I didn't make it back home to his funeral.
I had sent a note to his parents and received a lovely note in return about the support they had been given and how touched they were that so many old classmates came to pay their respects or contact them.
I don't think we will ever know what type of impression we leave on people.....we all hope it is a positive one I am sure.
I was proud to call Terry my friend.

I have had quite a few questions emailed to me recently and I'll take this opportunity to answer them1.Someone asked which medication I was taking for concentration -- the answer is Adderall -- it is a drug given for people with Attention Deficit Disorder.
I don't know if it works for everyone but it certainly has helped me.
I was having such a difficult time concentrating for more than an hour or so, it has definitely helpe me.
One of the side effects is that it will keep you awake so sometimes, even though I still feel like I need my afternoon nap, that is difficult to come by.
Sleeping at night though hasn't been a problem if I take my pill early in the morning.
It took a little while to get the dosage to where it has worked, but for now, it is helping.2.
Next questions was about travel since I have been talking about it a lot lately.
Someone wanted to know "how well I travel".
I wish I travelled better -- it is getting harder and harder to do if I go to a place I am unfamiliar with.
My husband was with me on the last two trips -- but the one up to Cape Cod was definitley harder because I had never been before.
Plus, all the tourists (me included) made it more difficult.
I don't do well in crowds -- I get a feeling of being overwhelmed and the noise is very distracting.
I find myself having panic attacks.
I know how to deal with them so I do, and having someone along certainly helps and can get me out of situations if need be.
Also, not overcrowding my schedule helps and lots of sleep.3.
Do I speak to groups?
was another question I have had recently.
My answer is yes -- and I love to do it.
I have said that as long as I can I want to be able to speak about this disease to help educate the public.
I'll go just about anywhere and talk to just about anyone.
As long as my expenses are covered I'm usually good to go.
I try to bring a bit of humor into my talks so it isn't "a downer" and try to share some day to day experiences with the audience.
Just leave me a message with contact information if you are interested and I promise I won't broadcast that information out to all the readers of this blog.4.
Memory Walk -- I've had several people ask me who can walk in a Memory Walk.
Anyone can walk in any walk across the country!
Of course, Memory Walk is the major fund raiser for the Alzheimer's Association but you do not have to raise money if you don't want to --- you can just find a walk near you and come out and support the cause.
If you do raise, $150 you will get an official "Memory Walk" t-shirt.
Walks are held all over the country in the fall -- go to www.alz.org or find a walk near you.
We need you all to come out and support our cause.Thanks for reading and thanks for your questions.

I have had quite a few emails about the Memory Walk spots that are playing around the country.
People are asking if that is me in those spots and yes, I am in some of them.
They were done a few years ago and are not playing in all markets.
There are certain spots that are running in all markets and many of you may have seen some of those.
Anyway, to answer the question, yes, that is me.My teeth are still bothering me.
Another trip to the dentist tomorrow.The medicine the doctor gave me for concentration though really seems to be working.
I'm keeping my fingers crossed that it will continue to help me.We had our Memory Walk Captain's meeting today.
If you would like to donate to the cause, please follow the link to the right that says Memory Walk Donation Page.
I know times are bad right now, but even a little helps!

Last year I had three crowns put in my mouth.
Last week I had a root canal.
I haven't had that much dental work in one year ever -- I've always had pretty healthy teeth -- what is up with that.
But, after the root canal last week things are a lot worse -- that tooth hurts now even more than it did before.
Of course, it started hurting late Friday afternoon so you know what I am going to be doing first thing today!But, I'm on my way to Atlanta for some business so if I am to get back into the dentist's chair it will have to wait at least one more day -- but it can't come soon enough.

We're back from the Northeast.
We flew into Boston and then went to Rhode Island.
We visited Newport and the International Tennis Hall of Fame and then some of the mansions there.
The next day we took the Ferry to Martha's Vineyard, then on to Cape Cod to visit my old college friend.
We hadn't seen each other in over 20 years and I think we picked up right where we left off.
We have been keeping in touch with each other over the years but it was so nice to see her again.
She and her husband have a beautiful house in Cape Cod but they live full time in Albany New York.
More soon -- just wanted to post a couple of photos.
We are sitting on her back porch -- the pond behind her is called "Katie's Pond".
The sunset is from the Cape Cod Bay.

I know it has been awhile.
My "concentration" medicine the doctor put me on isn't doing much good -- I go back tomorrow to see what he says.
And, I get to have a root canal tomorrow.
A girl just can't have too much fun in one day!Later in the week we are off to Cape Cod.
One of my best friends while in college has a summer home there and we are visiting her and her husband.
I have not seen her for 23 years -- I can't believe it has been that long but it has.
After working for a few years out of college she moved to Alaska, I then moved to Georgia.
She came down once to visit us here when Alan was about two years old.
She was in Atlanta on business and she got to visit for a few days.
We used to try to schedule our trips back to Peoria together so we could see each other but that got more and more difficult to do.
But, we have stayed in touch and this weekend we will finally get to catch up.
She left Alaska and moved to NY -- gained a new husband and they now reside in Albany.
I have never met her new husband so I am anxious to meet Bill as well.
And, we will get away from these 90+ degree days here in Georgia.

from DC.
Thanks to our son for being a great host.
We went a few places we hadn't been before like the new Air and Space Museum out by Dulles, a Baltimore Orioles game at Camden Yard and the National Cathedral.
We stayed busy -- the weather cooperated and it was nice to have a visit.
Things I always forget about Washington DC -- there is so much green space -- I know the city was planned but it is so odd to see it.
I wouldn't want to live there -- way too many people for me.
Makes me a little uncomfortable.
I got confused a good bit, but with Ralph and Alan there it was o.k.I had to rest a good bit but tried to stay up with the guys as much as I could.Our next trip is in a few weeks to Cape Cod.
That one should be interesting.

<doc date=Wednesday, June 24, 2009>
We're off to DC for a few days to visit with Alan.
Looking forward to a few days with him.
An infected tooth took me to the dentist today.
A round of antibiotics for me and a root canal when I return -- what fun.I finally got my medicine approved by the insurance company the doctor prescribed to help with my confusion.
It has a few weird side effects but hopefully they will taper off.More from the road.

<doc date=Monday, June 22, 2009>
I'm still dealing with the insurance company/doctor for the medicine he wants to give me for concentration.
I hope it can get resolved soon.
It seems like I have really really good days and really really bad days.
I'm realizing more and more things I cannot do and that frustrates me.
I've never felt like I couldn't do anything -- I might not want to do it, but I've always had that kind of attitude that you can do what you want or at least try.
No I know that I can't even try.
That's depressing for me.On a lighter note, we are going to DC to visit Alan this week.
His wife is visiting Taiwan with her sister and mom, so we are going to have some "just us" time.
Don't have a lot planned but it's always nice to visit.
Hopefully, I'll be able to do whatever it is we end up doing!

It's been awhile.
I've had a lot of things going on but not the concentration to put it all together.
I went to the neurologist today and he prescribed some medicine to help with my concentration but my insurance company won't pay for it.
So now, the doctor and the insurance company are duking it out -- and we'll see what happens.Since I last wrote --              My brother is back in the hospital              I'm getting a cold -- summer colds are the worse              We've planned a trip to Cape Cod for mid July              We've planned a trip to the US Open Tennis Tournament in NY at the end of August              It's gotten really hot here -- going to be close to 100 degrees by Friday              I'm starting to raise money for this year's Memory Walk (and recruiting walkers as well)              Have met two more people in the Athens area with early on-set Alzheimer's              Turned down an opportunity to do something that I wanted to do -- but had to admit that I just                     couldn't do it with Alzheimer's -- that was hard to doThere's probably a lot more -- but I can't bring those things to mind right now so I'll stop.
It's late and I'm tired.
I didn't get my nap in and I can tell.

My niece took this photo of her dad (my brother) with her four month old son Oliver, when my brother was in the hospital.
Thought it turned out well, so I wanted to share it.
Weekend was kind of slow.
It's already getting hot here so we are having to adjust our lifestyle a little bit.
It's not fun going out in the heat in the afternoon.
My son and daughter-in-law spent the weekend in Boston at Jennifer's sister's graduation from MIT.
Congratulations Christine!
Enjoyed watching Roger Federer win the French Open.
I think the whole crowd was rooting for him.
I also enjoyed watching native Athenian Tituss Burgess perform on the Tony Awards last night.
Tituss has been involved with musical theatre for so long here in Athens and for quite some time in New York.
He was featured in the Guys and Dolls performance last night.
We are going to meet Jennifer and Alan in New York later on in the summer to see Tituss and to also catch some of the US Open tennis matches.

Someone left a comment asking if I had gene testing.
This question has been put to me two or three times this week, so I thought I would address it briefly.
During my diagnosis process I had two spinal taps.
An analysis of the spinal fluid showed that I carried one copy of the APOE 4 gene.
APOE4 is associated with a higher risk of Alzheimer's.
About a quarter of the population inherits one copy of the APOE4 gene.
This increases their risk of developing Alzheimer's disease by up to four times.
However, you can have the APOE4 gene and not develop Alzheimer's -- you are just at greater risk.
There are other genes out there associated with Alzheimer's and I'm not sure how detailed my analysis got.
It showed a high level of Tau (I think that is right).
I am adding a link to a publication put out by the National Insitute of Aging/National Insititute of Health that can explain it a lot better than I can.
Here is the link http://www.nia.nih.gov/Alzheimers/Publications/geneticsfs.htmBoth of my parents died at a relatively young age (early 60's) and my father was adopted so we don't know anything of his family history.
It's possible in looking back by me and my two brothers that my grandfather may have shown signs of what they called back then "hardening of the arteries" or a dementia but we aren't sure.Doctors don't do genetic testing though just to see if you have the disease.
I say that, but then I also know people who have found doctors to do it.
If you're curious, have someone in your family that has Alzheimer's you should definitley discuss it with your doctor and make that decision together.

A couple of quick notes to these photos.
In the top photo is my friend Josh who was injured in Afghanistan.
He was in town to speak at a Memorial Day Celebration.
His arm is still in a brace and he is waiting for another surgery on his elbow.
He had a moving speech and there was a great attendance at the event, despite rain was ready to pour down any minute.
The second photo is me and my new friend Bill Dotson.
Bill made this walking stick for me.
Bill was diagnosed with Early On Set Alzheimer's as well and doesn't live too far away.
He read my post about needing a walking stick because of my balance and he made this for me.
Isn't he sweet?
Thanks Bill!
More soon -- I'm off to try to play golf before it gets too hot!

My husband has been gone for a few days.
This is pretty unusual for him because he is pretty much a home body and rarely travels by himself.
But what a difference it makes to me.
I know it sounds bad, but when he is away I feel a lot better.
I don't have to think, I don't have to talk, I don't have to listen to the television or the radio all the time, I don't have to constantly watch what I'm doing because he is watching over me......and as a result I don't get as fatigued.
I haven't had to nap for the last few days because I'm not feeling worn down by mid afternoon.
I still get tired, but not that mental fatigue that is so draining.
I'm sure that my husband would say "well, you don't have to do those things when I'm around" but he's wrong.
He doesn't take an active role in a lot of things and that means I have to try to think about things even if I can't or don't want to.
He hasn't quite caught up with the fact that soon, he will have to do most of the thinking for both of us.
I have a half day left to myself and I am going to enjoy it!

I have been having a hard time concentrating lately.
I haven't been sleeping well.
They could be related.
At any rate -- I was having a difficult time last night conveying something to my husband.
I realized then that the way I "see" things in my brain has changed.
I used to "see" things with words -- if I had a thought I was trying to say or get a point across it was words that I was forming in my brain and almost reading them back in order to explain something or even with a regular conversation.
Now, I see more images in my mind rather than words.
This makes it more difficult for me because I then have to convert those images to words and then get it out of my mouth!
How simple is that?
Not that simple for me.
Last night I had this whole storyboard of images in my mind with this story I was going to tell my husband.
I couldn't get it out -- I couldn't put the words to the images and make it come out.
I'm sure this sounds strange to most of you reading this, but I can't figure out another way to say it.I tried playing golf yesterday -- my concentration just wasn't there.
I didn't play too badly but it was such an effort it kind of takes the fun out of it -- if there is fun in playing golf!!
!On another note -- my new friend Bill (who also has younger on-set Alzhiemer's) and lives nearby read my post about the walking stick earlier this week and he made me one!
I haven't gotten it yet, but I'm excited about getting it.

I just finished watching the Caregivers segment of the HBO Alzheimer's Project Series.
The first person interviewed, Chuck Jackson, is a friend of mine.
It was great to see him and to see him in such great spirits.
Some of the quotes from the Caregiver's segment I can relate to ----"You're your own caregiver for awhile, then your friends and family""Living life in the moment""We try to stay in ther present and usually the present isn't so bad""If you can't cry about it all thet me you might as well laugh""Alzheimer's is a part of my life, I try not to dwell on it""People don't drop over like they used to.
you don't get invited very many places"These things are all so true

I've always said my best times were in the morning when I was rested.
My mind works much better then.
Or, after a nap.
Today I tried to play golf in the afternoon.
What a mistake.
I can't play that well anyway, but my concentration was out the proverbial window today.
Since we always walk the course,  I have to look at it as exercise -- which we know is good for the brain!
I should have asked my son for a walking stick for Mother's Day.
My balance is getting so bad.
I always realize this when I am out on the golf course and use my club as a modified walking stick.
When my husband and I go walking on trails I need one.
But I never think of it until I need it.
I forget......imagine that.
Maybe he'll read this and remember for me!

Well, I watched the Alzheimer's Project first series.
Many people have logged on to the blog -- probably because of the gentleman profiled there that had a blog.
My back story is that I was diagnosed 7 years ago with Early On Set Alzheimer's (not referred to as Younger On Set Alzheimer's) because I was diagnosed at an age before 65.
I was 46 years old at the time.Since I've kind of been following along with this project since its inception, I wasn't sure what the finished piece was going to feature.
Like many projects, the focus of the this documentary started out entirely different --or at least that is what I remember.
But, the finished product is something everyone should see.
If people and mainly legislatures that see this don't realize this is a disease we need to take seriously, then I am not sure of what will convince them.I'm looking forward to the future segments of this piece.Some of the lines in this first episode that struck home to me were:"That's what is so disgusting -- I feel so good......"The disease does "not take her intelligence away" -- this is hard to accept when you can't do the simple things in life -- you know you aren't stupid --it is just the disease talking"I have to read this a million times" in referring to a recipe -- I hate to have to do that!
"I never feel like I'm giving up" - you can't or you will.
"I don't want to be a burden" -- we all carry this I think"One day at time" -- live in the moment"Your judgment becomes an issue"  -- how true"my life is not that important in the grand scheme of things" -- you want to think so, but you have to know that it isn't.I'm sure others with this disease will see what fits them.
Since we aren't around others like ourselves at this stage it is almost comforting to know we aren't alone although we feel it.For those of you that are reading this blog that need help, please seek help with either a doctor's office, an association like the Alzheimer's Association or wherever you can find what you need.
Keeping this blog for years has helped and I call it my therapy -- others have their way of dealing with this as well.
Find out what works for you and try to stay positive.
It's hard, but when you fight something it's almost as if you are in a competition -- somebody always wants to win -- and I'm not a very good loser.
Thanks for reading and hope that you will drop by often.

Happy Mother's Day this Sunday to all those mothers out there reading this.
The best thing that anyone has ever called me is "Alan's Mom".
It was nice having him home this past weekend -- an early Mother's Day present for me.
Just spending time with him is enough.
I wish I could take the credit for him being the man he is today -- but I know that he has done most of that himself.
I'm real proud of him.My relationship with my mother was pretty bad.
We were like oil and water.
I was never good enough.
We went long periods of time without speaking.
And, it is sad.
But, I tried.
I don't remember early Mother's Days with her, but as I became an adult they became harder and harder.
I never, ever bought her a present she liked.
She would yell at me for buying certain things because "you know I don't like this" is what would come back to me.
If I knew that I wouldn't have bought it for her -- but I guess she thought I was doing it on purpose.
If I chose the route of sending flowers I would get the response "you don't take the time to go buy me a present so you take the easy way out and call the florist".
As you can see a no win situation.
Before she passed away twenty years ago we had become friends somewhat I guess, but never had that mother daughter bond.
As a result, Mother's Day was always a problem for me -- I was damned if I did and damned if I didn't.My first Mother's Day as a mother 25 years ago didn't go so well either.
My husband is not a person that usually buys presents or thinks about getting a card or wishing someone a happy birthday.
I always bought the presents for his mother, sent the cards and was sure that he called her on Mother's Day.
But, I was sure that my first Mother's Day would be different.
Was I wrong.
After going most of that day without even a "Happy Mother's Day" from his lips (Alan was 7 months old at the time) I was sure that he had something planned for that evening.
About 4:30 he asked me what we were having for dinner.
At that point I knew there were no surprises.
I asked him if he was ever going to wish me a Happy Mother's Day and his response was "You're not my mother".
I don't think I need to say anymore!So, all my friends out there that are Mother's -- even though you are not MY mother, I wish you all a great day on Sunday.

Last night, in Macon Georgia we went to an Alzheimer's benefit concert by the Manhattan Transfer.
That is a group I have always liked so I was glad when I heard they were playing.
The development director in the Macon office asked Alan to come from Washington DC and speak before the concert.
Last year, I spoke before their benefit concert so it was nice that they asked him to speak.
I was so proud of him -- as every mother would be -- but he put a lot of his emotions into the speech and it was very well received.
Lots of people came up to him afterwards and told him how touched they were by his remarks.
I know how hard that must have been for him to write and I appreciate him and love him so much.
I've posted a few photos from last night.
Thanks to all in Macon for such a great evening.

Many of you may have heard that today, there was a shooting at a community theatre here in Athens.
Three people were killed.
Here is a link to the story from the Atlanta Journal Constitution http://www.ajc.com/metro/content/metro/stories/2009/04/25/uga_professor_shooting.html?cxntlid=homepage_tab_newstabIt is so sad.
I knew two of the three victims.
They had been involved in community theatre for quite awhile and both great people.
Athens will miss them.My thoughts and prayers go out to the whole Town and Gown Theatre family.

This week I was volunteering at a charity golf event.
One of the ladies working the registration area with me was talking about her book club and mentioned that they had just finished discussing "Still Alice".
If you have been following my blog you know how much I like this book and that "Alice" is so like me (although in the book she is fictional).
The other lady was talking about how sad the book was and that is was so awful what she and her family were going through.
I hesitated for awhile before I said anything -- I'm never quite sure what to say -- I don't like to point out my Alzheimer's but sometimes I think I should.
I mentioned I had read the book and actually knew the author.
I was hoping that that would start someone asking me more questions -- like how do you know the author?
How many authors do you know?
But no one did.
I thought that strange and let it go.
We were busy doing our assigned jobs at registration and didn't feel like that was the time to go into it.
But afterwards, I wished I did say something.
I'm not sure what I would have said, but I would have said something.
Sometimes I never know when to keep my mouth shut -- sometimes I don't know when to open it!

<doc date=Tuesday, April 14, 2009>
A week or so ago I wrote about the tv show Friday Night Lights and the character on the show that has Alzheimer's -- or Alzheimer's related symptoms, because I'm never sure on the show whether they have acknowledged that she has Alzheimer's -- she appears to.
Anyway, in last week's show her family is taking her to an assisted living facility and she is going through things to take.
There is a photo of her grandson when he was seven years old (he is now a senior in high school) that she wants to take.
He keeps telling her not to take that photo.
She then says "when I have one of my spells and can't remember I want to look at this photo so I can remember you"  -- or something close to that affect.
Last summer, I went through a similar experience so having her say the words really caught me off guard and I realized what I probably sounded like.
But, last summer I insisted on getting a new photo done of my husband, me and my son for the explicit purpose so "when I get into a home this a photo I want to have in my room -- so I can remember you".
Kind of scary when you hear someone else say it.
It's kind of like when you say something and you sound like your mother.

I got to meet my friends Pody and Rick from Champaign while I was in Illinois.
I had to be sure that the Illinois logo on Rick's shirt showed so people didn't think I was hanging around a Tennessee fan.
And, my great nephew Oliver is the handsome young man on my lap.
Oliver was born in November.

I'm back from another trip to Illinois where I was visiting my ailing brother Bill.
He just can't seem to catch a break.
We received some more disheartening news of his condition while I was there.
My other brother, Tom, and I went to dinner with Bill's children, Elizabeth and Jonathan.
They are in their late 20's early 30's and have families of their own.
As I am, we are all struggling with the problems Bill is facing.
They want answers and so do I.
Unfortunately the answers are somewhat elusive.
I feel bad in that Tom and I are the "adults" if you will in this situation and we are not able to help Elizabeth and Jonathan with the answers they need.
I feel so helpless.
I feel like I should be able to provide the support they need and I can't.
I've never really felt like the "grown up" giving out advice.
But, they were looking for it and I couldn't help.
No one can -- and that is the difficult part.As I look at the situation, I realize that in my own life people feel helpless because they can't help me either.
But, I'm not looking for help in terms of what people can do for me.
I just need people to be around me for friendship and companionship -- not to forget about me because I'm sick.
There will be days when my family needs help and I hope my firends are there to help them when the time comes.
I feel bad that I am going to be a burden on people and hope that it isn't too bad.
I feel as inadequate about that as I do about not being able to help my neice and nephew find the answers they need.

This goose along with another goose made it to our house today.
We have had so much rain in the last week or so that in the background you can see the water standing in our front yard.
I don't know if these geese made a detour on their trip up north or what but they were certainly looking for food.
We feed the crows, the squirrels, other cats and whatever comes our way in the back of our house.
We usually feed them cat food -- I know it sounds weird but they eat it.
The geese didn't seem to care that much for it.
But they were lovely to watch before they flew away.
Today I went to a funeral.
The father of a man I used to work for passed away.
The service was lovely.
He was loved my many and it showed.
Life is just too short.
Friday Night Lights is a show that airs on Friday nights about high school football in Texas.
Last week while I was speaking at the Alzheimer's Conference there I had the pleasure of meeting one of the character's grandfather.
His grandson, Jesse Plemmons, is a Champion for the Alzheimer's Association.
Jesse's grandmother had Alzheiemer's.
Coincidentally, in the show there is a story line that involves another character on the show with his grandmother who has Alzheimer's.
Although it is not clearly stated that that is her condition, it is understood to be -- at least by me.
Anyway, the show has been dealing with this story line in a very dignified manner.
But last week it struck a chord with me.
I could see myself in the character and it is scary.
Just as I saw myself in the Still Alice book.
You can talk about this disease a lot, but when you see yourself, it is scary and becomes even more real.
It's hard to explain, but it is also hard to watch.
HBO is coming out with a series beginning in May about Alzheimer's.
They have been working on this for about two years.
I have been to several conferences where they were shooting.
I believe it starts May 10th and it is a four part series.
It will be good I'm sure as they have put a lot of time and effort into it.
I'm not sure if it is something I can watch either -- I know I'll tape it and watch it over time, but I'm not sure if I can watch it all at once.
Terry Moran, one of the hosts of ABC's Nightline program just did a short series on Alzheimer's.
He has Alzheimer's in his family and he goes the through the process in his piece about getting his DNA tested to see what his chances of getting Alzheimer's are.
Here is a link to the piece http://abcnews.go.com/Video/playerIndex?id=7175910.
He also interviews Meryl Cromer, a member of Newt Gingrich's Alzheimer's Study Group (ASG).
I had the pleasure of working with Meryl on a prelude committee to the ASG about a year and a half ago.
She is a true crusader.
And, in the piece she also finds out what her chances are for developing Alzheimer's.
She now cares for her husband and mother who both suffer from the disease.
Please note that the tests that they had only were indicators of developing Alzheimer's not that they would definitely get Alzheimer's.
During my diagnosis I had a spinal tap which indicated that I carried one of the genese for Alzheimer's but it didn't necessarily mean that I would get Alzheimer's -- it was just one of many markers in my diagnosis.
The story is interesting and I thank ABC and Mr. Moran for doing it.
I'm off to Illinois again on Saturday to visit my ailing brother.
I'm hoping to find him in better spirits and in better health.
I'll report when I return.
Thanks for reading and sharing your comments with me.

I was the guest of the North Central Texas Alzheimer's Assn.
chapter last week.
I spoke at a conference they were holding and it had a great turnout.
Over 400 people were registered and despite bad weather I think they all came.
Shelley Bluethmann from the National Office and I were invited to be their keynote speakers.
I really enjoyed my time there (although brief) and I appreciate the warm hospitality of all the Texans.
Shelly Young did a great job of putting the event together and Theresa Hocker was a great hostess as well.
The photo above isn't too good, but I wanted to model the cowboy hat they gave me as an "honorary Texan".
Thanks for having me -- I really appreciated meeting everyone and sharing my story.I arrived back to Athens to rainy dreary days but I was pretty exhausted so I took the opportunity to rest.
More next week.

Today, news Facts and Figures were released by the Alzheimer's Association.
For a link to the study go here: http://www.alz.org/news_and_events_2009_facts_figures.aspMore news will be coming out this week about the Alzheimer's study group so please watch for more on that.On another note, my friend Josh, who I have written about was recently interviewed by NBC Nightly News.
The piece aired last night.
Josh is doing so much better and he looks great on the video.
I'm posting two links -- one that was the piece that aired and the other was a "web only" piece.

This weekend our UGA Women's basketball team plays in the first round of the NCAA tournament.
The tournament is being held about 50 miles from home in Duluth Georgia.
UGA is the actual host of the tournament even though it is not at UGA.
Anyway, I am actually working the event this weekend.
A friend of mine in the athletic department needed some help so I am working it .
Yesterday was the first day of practice and today are the first two games.
It hasn't been too bad so far -- I'm anxious for the games to begin.Next week, I'm off to Texas where I will meet someone with the Alzheimer's Association for a meeting.
We are going to be keynote speakers at an event the Texas Alzheimer's Associaton is having.
So far, 400 people have signed up for the conference.
I'm looking forward to it.This weekend starts the public policy forum in Washington DC.
Please be watching for lots of news out of this conference.More when I return from Texas.

It's not too late to register for the Public Policy Forum hosted by the Alzheimer's Association at the end of this month in Washington DC.
If you register before March 13th there is a discount.
Go to http://www.alz.org/publicpolicyforum/09/overview.asp for more information.At this year's conference the Alzheimer's Study Group (ASG) will be presenting their findings from an almost two year study of the state of Alzheimer's in the United States.
The ASG was originated by former House Speaker Newt Gingrich who heads the for profit organization Center for Health Transformation.
The ASG is a bipartisan study and one of its members is Former Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor.
Last year she and Speaker Gingrich spoke to a senate subcommittee during the Public Policy Forum on what they were trying to accomplish.
This year, the results are in and the findings will be revealed at the Public Policy Forum.
I have been fortunate to be involved with a group that gave input to the ASG and I'm anxious to see how some of these ideas and thoughts we had made its way into the study.
Hopefully, we will learn a lot and hopefully, some of these ideas can be implemented to not only save the government some money in dealing with Alzheimer's but also to help the families struggling with this disease.
If you can't make it to the forum, please watch the news toward the end of the month because it will certainly be making headlines.Also, at this year's forum there will be an early stage summitt which will feature Still Alice author Lisa Genova who I have written about several times.
I learned this week that a friend in Atlanta who has Alzheimer's and his wife will be joining Lisa during a panel discussion.
Alzhiemer's will be in the news --there's lots going on.

About 300 advocates emerged on Atlanta yesterday to talk to our legislators about issues dealing with Alzheimer's.
It was a great day.
We were all wearing purple t-shirts that said "voice" across the front.
There was a press conference with the Governor which drew some press to the event.
The Governor's mother-in-law was recently diagnosed with Alzheimer's so this is also a personal thing for him.
We had people come in buses from all over the state.
Ralph and I went and there were a few other people from around our area there including a new friend I have made, Bill Dotson.
I was deeply touched that my daughter-in-law's father, Charles Lee also showed up to be with us.
I didn't know he was coming and it really meant a lot to me that he would take time out of his day to join us.
Most of the legislators we met with were receptive to what we had to say but with the budget the way it is in our state (and probably almost every other state) we will have to see what happens.
One thing I have been working towards is an Alzheimer's Task Force that would look at issues such as driving assessments, emergency placement and better long term health care.
This is something that will not take a lot of money but just requires some time and effort on some of our legislators part.
Thanks to Kathy Simpson and Ginny Helms of the Georgia Alzheimer's Assn.
for putting this together.
I look forward to next year's event.

Now that the snow has passed and it is 70 plus degrees outside today, it is time to go out and pick up all the limbs and branches that fell off our trees during the snow/ice storm.
It did a lot of damage in Athens and we will be picking up debris for awhile.Monday is our Advocacy Day at the Capitol in Atlanta.
There will be a press conference with the Governor that I will be speaking at and hopefully we can get some people's attention on  Monday.Last week, when our power was out, I had a lady call me from Missouri.
She had seen an article in a magazine about me and my struggles with Alzheimer's and she was desperate to talk to someone.
Her husband, 64, has been showing signs of Alzheimer's (loss of short term memory, confusion, getting lost) and she needed to talk.
She had been letting her husband do all the financial things around the house and as a result the house is in foreclosure and there are some issues she is having to deal with because these things were not tended to.
One of her first questions to me was "do you have problems with math?"
That seems to be a universal problem with all of us -- and I think she was relieved to know that but at the same time realized how much of a mess she was in.
She couldn't talk long because she didn't want her husband hearing her talking to me.
Since the power was out I couldn't look up the 800 Alzheimer's number but I told her how to get it and I hope she will call.
She asked if she could call me again and of course I said yes.
I hope she can find some help somewhere.
At least she realizes that there is a problem there.

The newspaper said we got 6.5 inches of snow.
The most Athens has ever had was 8 inches and that was in 1983.
We remember that one too but this snow was so wet and heavy that it did a lot more damage.
In the last photo I decided to take my black cat out to play in the snow with me.
She didn't like it much!
We didn't make the snow creatures -- someone else on our block did.
I was starting to get a little panicky after about 24 hours without power.
Not from being without power but just not having things be normal.
Over the weekend, I was in Macon for the Georgia Sports Hall of Fame induction.
Our UGA women's basketball coach was being inducted.
While there I met with the Macon Alzheimer's Development Director and got to meet a lovely couple they serve.
Cheryl and Norman met us for breakfast.
Their daughter has been active with their association as well since her father was first diagnosed.
They were a lovely couple and I hope I get to see them again next week at our state Advocacy Day in Atlanta.

Well, we got hit with some pretty big snow this past weekend.
It was beautiful and I'm going to post some photos later -- I know you Northerners will be used to it.
(I am a transplanted one you know) -- but with it brought massive power outages.
We lost our power on Sunday night about 5 p.m. and got it back 31 hours later!
So, I'm just catching up to things on the internet.
We were lucky that we have a gas stove and at least we could heat water and cook some things.
We took hot water to our neighbors so they could at least have soup and coffee.
By Friday it is suppose to be 70 degrees here.
Go figure.
More soon.

I'm heading to Macon Georgia this weekend.
The UGA Women's basketball coach is getting inducted into the Georgia Sports Hall of Fame and I am going with some other booster club members.
I'm trying to get a cold so I hope that doesn't make the trip awful.My brother is still in the hospital.
It seems he takes one step forward and two steps back.
We found out this week there are some more things that have attacked his body if you will.
Please keep him in your thoughts and prayers.Next week we have training for Alzheimer's Advocacy Day.
March 9th is Alzheimer's Day at the state capitol here in Georgia.
If you live in Georgia I would encourage you to join us.
We are hoping we will have 500 people carry our message to legislators.
If you need more information go to www.alz.org/georgia.I haven't been as sharp this week.
I'm not sure if it is because of the cold, not being on my schedule, being tired or not taking my meds at the right time (probably the latter) but hopefully I can get straightened out this week.

I'm home from Illinois.
My brother is holding his own, but has a very very long way to go.

I'm in Illinois this week visiting my sick brother.
I didn't think I was going to have to come but it was time.
I haven't seen him in nine months so you can imagine he didn't look real good to me.
He is having surgery again today.
He has a long way to go.
On top of his diabetes and all the trouble he has had with that he also has colon cancer.
They removed a tumor last week the size of his head.
I just can't imagine.
It will be several months before he can start his chemo as there are quite a few other things wrong and they have to take care of those first.
It's way too long and complicated to go into but suffice it to say he has a long way to go.
My plan is to return to Georgia on Sunday.
Please keep him in your prayers.

Hope everyone had a great Valentine's Day weekend.
My son and husband both surprised me with gifts and believe me -- I was surprised......not by my son's gift but by my husband's.
I don't think he has ever given me a gift for Valentine's Day -- needless to say he is not a gift giver!
So, that was extra special.Each week Google sends me a list of news articles that have been published during the week.
Last week an article caught my eye about Alzheimer's drugs.
The article was from the Orlando Sentinel.
The gist of the article was why do the drug companies paint such a rosy picture of Alzheimer's when there is no hope.
When I looked at the bottom of the article I saw where the article had been written by a writer in Stone Mountain Georgia -- not too far from where I live.
His email address was attached so I emailed him.
I had to differ with his opinion in the area that the Alzheimer's drugs on the market today can help some people -- especially in the early stages.
If it weren't for drugs I wouldn't be writing this blog today.
Yes, the drugs interact with people differently and although they won't help forever, it does give you a chance to lead a somewhat productive life in the beginning.
I don't think the advertisements are misleading -- they don't say there is a cure -- they say there is help.
The writer and I have a few back and forth exchanges.
When I received my list from Google this week, there was another article by the writer this time about the feedback he had received from his article including some of my comments.
There's always two sides (if not more) to a story.

<doc date=Friday, February 13, 2009>
Thanks to all who have called or email asking about my brother.
His surgery went o.k.
but he has a ways to go.
At least he is getting the care he needs.
I was heading to Illinois, but am going to wait a bit after talking with family members.
Thanks again and please keep him in your thoughts and prayers.

Last week my husband and I had the opportunity to meet a gentleman in our area that has early on set Alzheimer's and his lovely wife.
We met for coffee and it was nice to get to know them.
Bill and I shared "our moments" and his wife and my husband shared "their frustrations" --that probably isn't the right word for it but close enough.
I was so relieved to hear Bill say that when he was having his "moments" they felt like out of body experiences.
He is so right --that is the way I have been describing things since I was diagnosed.
It was nice to hear someone else say that.This weekend is Valentine's Day.
Over the last few days I have heard several people complain about the lame presents their husbands give them for Valentine's Day.
I want to shout at them -- "At least you get something and someone is thinking about you!"
I have written here on occasion about my brother.
He is in very poor health and has not done anything about it.
I worry all the time about him because over the years he could have done something about his condition -- but he hasn't.
In the last week his health has deteriorated and we have all been concerned.
Last night, he finally agreed to go to a hospital and at least will we get a take on what is going on with him.
The prognosis is probably not good.
I only write about this because if you love your family -- take care of yourself.
I always say how guilty I feel about having Alzheimer's because I didn't do anything to get this disease and it is so hard on my family.
When you have a health issue that is treatable -- please do something about it --not only for you but for your family.
They care about you and that says a lot.
Even if you don't care about yourself they do -- so don't be selfish and get help when you need it.OK -- I'm off my soap box now.
My husband turns 65 tomorrow.
We are going to celebrate.

Yes, I know it has been awhile.
Every time I sit down I can't seem to get the words to come out the way I want them.
But, I decided I was going to take a stab at it with some random thoughts today.My husband bought a motorcycle yesterday.
It is a 30 year old motorcycle -- just like one he had thirty years ago.
I call it his "late life crisis".
He turns 65 in a few weeks so that is his birthday present to himself.
I just want to be sure his life insurance is paid up.I had a neurologist appointment this week.
It's so frustrating when there is nothing he can really do to help you.
"stay on your meds and see you in six months" is what I hear.
He also told me that I am a poster child for the disease -- I don't want to be a poster child for anything!My friend Josh that I have written about is doing great despite all the surgeries and everything he has been through.
I actually got to visit with him for awhile yesterday and he is extremely upbeat and positive.
He knows how bad it could have been.
He has quite a few more surgeries to go through and will be in the hospital for quite awhile yet, but it was so good to see him.About six months ago I opened a Facebook account.
I'm still kind of getting the hang of it and don't have too many friends.
However, it has been fun to re-connect with people I've lost track of and make new friends as well.
I have met several people that live nearby that have Early On-Set Alzheimer's and that has been good for me.
I hope to keep adding friends and getting better at "Facebooking".I'm going to try to be better about posting....but I know I have said that before.

is certainly an historic day isn't it.
We just watched the inauguration on television and it was quite a site.
I don't care what party affiliation you are, I think it was moving.
My son and daughter-in-law were lucky enough to get into the Newseum a few blocks from the capitol to watch in the warmth.
Several of the news groups have been broadcasting from there including CNN.
I also have some friends that had tickets and I'm anxious to see there photos.I wanted to follow up on some other fronts.
I have written about my friend Josh who was injured in Afghanastan.
He is now stateside and has had several more surgeries for his wounds.
He is scheduled for another surgery on Thursday.
Keep him in your prayers and thoughts please.
If you would like an address for Josh please leave a comment for me with your email address and I will send you more info.
I promise not to publish your email address.Yeseterday I spoke to a gentleman in the Atlanta area that is going through the diagnosis of Alzheimer's.
He is close to a final diagnosis and has been going through all the "alphabet soup" tests we go through for this disease.
He is waiting his appointment for a neuro-pysch test which is usually one of the last things to have done.
I wish him well -- he is trying to fight this the best he can.
He also has a blog.
It's address is www.wheretobud.blogspot.com if you want to check it out.
I hope to be communicating with him more and staying in touch with his situation.Monday March 9 is Alzheimer's Awareness Day at the Georgia State Capitol.
If you are reading this and live in Georgia we need to you to come to Atlanta to be a special part of this day.
For more information go to http://www.alz.org/georgia/in_my_community_education.asp  We want at least 500 people there advocating on our behalf, so please come out.
Kathy Simpson at the state office is organizing this day and she is doing a great job.
Please come out if you can.March 23-25 Public Policy Forum -- Washington DC -- Please consider taking a look at attending this year's public policy forum in Washington DC.
I have been several years and it is very enlightening.
It is important that those with the disease be heard and families also have a voice.
There will be many people speaking at the conference that have Alzheiemer's and it is also a way to learn about what is happening with research, funding and public policy.
For more information go to http://www.alz.org/publicpolicyforum/09/overview.asp  If you want to register please talk to one of the meeting planners as those with the disease may be able to get a special dispensation.
On March 23rd there will be an Early Stage Summit which is especially for people with dementia.
Several of the sessions during the meeting will also include a speaker living with Alzheimer's so that perspective will be integrated in the discussions.Still Alice I've spoken about this book for awhile now.
It is now #5 on the New York Times Best Seller list.
It can be found in your local bookstores as well as Wal-Mart.
Don't miss this book.
Author Lisa Genova's account of Alzheimer's in a young professor hits the nail on the head.
It's a must read.
Side note: -- Lisa will be one of the speakers at the Public Policy Forum in March.I apologize for not blogging more recently.
I've had a lot to do and when I get busy at home it is hard for me to put my thoughts together enough to sit down and write.
I have a few trips planned over the next few days so it will be next week before there are any more entries.
Thanks for your comments -- I enjoy hearing from everyone.

Since posting the entry below I have had several inquiries as to how to contact Josh.
I have learned this morning that it is possible that he will be leaving Germany possibly as early as Tuesday to head state side.
It is not known yet where he will be sent for further medical treatment.
When I have that information I will pass it along.
Thanks for all your concern, thoughts and prayers.

This week has been slow.
That's good because I had a lot to catch up on and to get back to my routine.
I feel like I am a little more settled than I was over the holidays.I received news this week that my friend Josh -- who has been mentioned here in my blog several times and who is serving in Afghanastan was injured this week in the line of duty.
His unit was targeted by a suicide bomber.
Several in his unit were injured and they also lost two soldiers.
Josh has had three surgeries so far and will be facing more in the coming months.
We are thankful he is alive.
Right now he is in Germany but is hoping to be transported back to the United States soon.
He took shrapnel in the pelvis and his right leg.
In addition his right arm is shattered, his right ear drum is shattered and he has first degree burns on his face and parts of his body.
Please keep Josh in your thoughts and prayers as well as all of those that serve us in the military.
Josh was home at Thanksgiving and I posted a photo of him on this site.
Josh worked for me several years ago and is about the same age as my son.
I kind of like to think of him as a surrogate son but I'm not sure he would look at it that way!
Please keep him in your prayers.

Every year brings new beginnings.
The gym was packed yesterday with everyone beginning on their fitness routines       Weight Watchers was packed on Saturday with everyone beginning a new diet       Our University Town suddenly got busy again with students beginning a new semester       My daughter-in-law began a new job       In a few weeks there will be a new beginning for a new presidentI'm sure you can count my new beginnings surrounding you as well.
I think I look at each day as a new beginning -- it is certainly better than looking at it as a doomed ending.On another note -- I've written about this book before Still Alice.
Today, author Lisa Genova had this book released by a new publisher and if you haven't read it you should.
When I read it, it was my life -- I couldn't believe how accurate a portrayal this was for a fiction book about someone with Early On-Set Alzheimer's.
Go to your local books store and get it if you can.
If it isn't on your shelf this week it will be soon.
If you want to learn more about this disease read this book --it's an easy read.
It is a Barnes & Noble Discover Pick for Winter 2009It is an Indie Next Pick for JanuaryTarget Book Club Pick for FebruaryBorders Book Club Pick for FebruaryGood Read Pick for March in Australian Women's WeeklyHere's an article about it and Alzheimer's in today's Buffalo News:http://www.buffalonews.com/494/story/541205.html

The holidays have been nice, but now it is time to get back to reality.
It was great having Alan and Jennifer home, but with all the extra "stuff" that accompanies Alan (no offense Son) it was starting to get on my nerves.
I had to take all the Christmas stuff down shortly after Christmas Day because I was starting to have panic attacks.
Have to get back to that routine you know!!
!One thing I enjoy most about the holidays is hearing from friends you don't hear from often.
I love getting Christmas cards and I like to send them as well.
What worries me is when I don't hear from some one that has been sending cards and letters for years and then I don't hear from them.
I'm going to make an effort to contact them and hope that they are well.
When I was diagnosed with Alzheimer's I realized how much my family and friends meant to me.
I've said it here before that it is a shame that something has to strike you before you realize what is important in life -- but you hear many people say that.
So, it has been important to me to remain friends and reconnect with friends I have let slip by the wayside.
This past fall, a friend of mine popped back in my life that I was so grateful for.
We had been friends for years professionally and when we both switched jobs we kind of lost track of each other.
Then I ran into her in a local deli and I was so excited to see her and catch up on her life.
Unfortunately, I learned that her husband too was suffering from dementia.
She was glad to run into me as well and we shared notes and reconnected our friendship.
That has meant so much to me.
If you are looking for a new year's resolution -- don't look far.
Look to re-establish or to at least strengthen your friendships.
You'll be glad you did.

Well -- it is finally cold here in Athens.
The high today is suppose to be in the upper 30's.
But by Christmas Day they are looking at temps in the mid 60's.
At least it will feel like Christmas for a couple of days!
I know I haven't been good at blogging over the last week or so.
Have been busy and trying to prepare for this week.
We have been getting together with friends over the last several weeks and will again until after Christmas.
Fourteen people are coming to our house for dinner on Christmas.
Everyone is bringing something so it won't be too much work for me.
I'm sure that by this time next week I'll be ready to have the tree down and have things back to "normal".
I function so much better when things are near "normal".Wishing all of you a happy, merry holiday!

Well I have so much to do and don't want to do any of it.
I just can't get motivated.
We have two Christmas parties this weekend -- and I have been complaining that we haven't done anything "Christmassy" but I'm not excited about going to the parties.
That's contradictory isn't it?
I suppose when the time rolls around I'll feel like it.
It doesn't feel much like Christmas to me yet.
I've done the shopping, wrapping and sent all my presents off to friends and family across the globe, but I still can't get into it.
I think it is just all overwhelming to me at times and I don't think I can handle it all.
Perhaps if the weather turns cold and feels like "Christmas" that will help.

Alan, Josh, Chris, me, Melissa (Josh' wife) and Katie (Chris' wife) I hope everyone had a good holiday.
I did -- but now I need to rest up.
We spent a quiet day with friends for dinner.
Our son came in early morning on Thursday and we went to Atlanta to pick him up.
It was nice having a few days for just the three of us.On Saturday, we huddled around the television set to watch UGA play Georgia Tech.
For the first time in seven years, Georgia Tech beat Georgia.
Since GT is Alan's Alma mater -- he was extremely happy.
It was finally his year to gloat -- he certainly had to wait a long time.On Saturday night Alan and I went to a "come see Josh" party.
The photo above was taken there.
If you have been following my blog, there are two young gentlemen that used to work for me that I continue to follow through their life's journeys.
They are both a year older than Alan and when Alan went away to college, these two young men, Chris and Josh worked in the box office of the theatre that I was managing.
They had many friends in common and they kind of became my "surrogate sons" for lack of a better word.
I'm not sure they would agree that that is the proper word, but it works for me!
Since that time Alan,  Josh and Chris have all gotten married in the last year or so.
Chris now lives in Ft. Lauderdale with his new wife Katie and he is going to medical school.
Josh was home for some R&R as he has been deployed in Afghanistan.
His wife Melissa just bought a new house and we went to see him and to see the new house on Saturday night.
It is not often we can get together with everyone spread all over the world.
Josh returns to Afghanistan in a week or so and will be finished with his deployment in July.
These young men have been extremely kind to me over the years and are great about keeping in touch.
I only wish the best for them.
Since Chris and Josh are both huge Georgia fans, the defeat to Georgia Tech was a little more than they could handle.Now Alan has returned to Washington DC and I need some rest.

I know, I know -- I have not been blogging in awhile.
There's no excuse.
I've been lazy.I spoke last week at an assisted living center in a small town about 30 miles away.
It was a very nice setting and those I spoke to seemed to be genuinely interested in what I had to say.
They had some good questions and that is always a good thing for me.My niece back in Illinois had a little baby boy last night.
It's her third child and I'm glad she had it now so she can enjoy the holidays.
She was three weeks early, but the baby and mom and doing fine.
She won't have to go back to work until after Christmas.I hope everyone enjoys the Thanksgiving holiday.
Enjoy your families and the time you have with them!

Well our Memory Walk is over for this year.
My team raised over $15,000!
The goal for the entire walk was $75,000 and we are short of that but we are expecting some more donations and we'll be close.
Thanks Lauren M for your donation through this page!I woke up on walk morning and it was pouring down rain.
That was at 5 a.m.
I rushed to the computer to look at the radar and it showed that it was moving out.
By about 8:15 the skies were blue and it was windy but no rain.
It turned out to be a great day weatherwise.
Later in the day the winds kicked up and a cold front moved through but not before the walk was over.Thanks again to everyone who supported my team!

There is still time to donate on line at https://www.kintera.org/faf/donorReg/donorPledge.asp?ievent=263086&lis=1&kntae263086=45CDC69FE5EB408ABAB1BC12959A015B&supId=9079347Thanks for all your support.

I am feeling a bit overwhelmed lately.
I think what bothers me most is that I shouldn't be overwhelmed.
I have a few things that I need to do, but I can't seem to wrap my arms around them and do them.
The tasks seem daunting but they are not.
In my "old life" I would tackle all of these projects in one day and be done with them.
Now it takes me forever to get my thoughts together enough just to post to this blog!Thanksgiving is in a few weeks.
We usually get together with friends at someone's house.
I was thinking of being the host this year, but I realized I couldn't do it without help.
Alan is flying in from Washington DC on Thanksgiving morning and Ralph will be going to Atlanta to pick him up.
That means that no one would be around to help me get everything together for a meal.
So, I knew that I couldn't host friends coming over.
The realization of that bothers me a lot.
I realize that I could have asked some of my friends to come and help me but I didn't want to do that.
I wanted to do it myself and I can't.
That makes me sad.
Of course, one of our friends volunteered to do the hosting and we will all be together on Thanksgiving.
I'm thankful for that and for the fact that Alan is going to be here.
But it makes me feel inadequate and I don't like that.

Happy Halloween to everyone!
Alan received word today that he passed the bar exam.
We are so happy!

I've spent the last two days in the hospital.
I was having some chest pains over the weekend.
I had had them earlier in the summer, but this time they seemed a bit worse.
I just had this sensation that someone was standing on my chest.
So, I went to the hospital on Monday morning.
Going to the hospital is never fun.
There are two hospitals in Athens and we usually go ot the same one every time -- although I'm not going to say which one.
We have never really had a bad experience at this hospital -- until this trip.
The good news about the whole experience is that I didn't have a heart attack and there is no damage to my heart.
I have extremely low blood pressure and always have.
That could be my culprit.
But I'm fine now and enjoyed being in my own bed for a full night's sleep last night.
The bad news is that the as I mentioned the experience on this trip was awful.
I'm not going to go into it hear, but I did take lots of notes and plan to write to the hospital.
There is another option in town, and perhaps next time I'll take that option.
I felt my "Alzheimer's" kicking in when I became very frustrated and stressed while there.
It wasn't pretty!!
!Many of you have asked about Alan and Jennifer.
I know I didn't post much when we returned from Washington but it was a quick trip.
Their apartment is nice -- really small -- but nice and in a nice new apartment complex.
The roof has an area where you can go sit and there are even hammocks!
I liked that part.
I'm not sure how much of the year you can enjoy being on the top of the roof and not freeze to death -- but the weekend we were there it was delightful.
They live a close walk to the National Zoo and we walked down there to see the pandas.
Alan commutes every day on the metro.
There is a metro station connected to their apartment building and his office sits on top of a metro station so he really doesn't have to deal with the elements too much on his daily commute.
Jennifer has not found a job yet.
I hope with the economic downturn we are in that she will get one -- it may take her awhile but we are hoping the best for her.
Alan finds out this week if he passed the bar exam.
He enjoys his job with Hogan and Hartson.
He's working a lot but I don't think much more than when he was in law school since he spent so much time studying.
Memory Walk is in a couple of weeks.
Donations are down and that is probably a reflection of the economy.
Don't forget to vote if you haven't already.
I went the second or third day of early voting and didn't have to wait at all.
Now I know the lines are long -- but it is important for everyone to vote.

I've been busy with speaking engagements lately.
Last week I spoke to a graduate level course at UGA in Gerentology.
Their class was fun -- they had some interesting questions.
It's nice to get a chance to talk to young people about Alzheimer's.
I think it helps to look at it from a different perspective.Early this week, I went to Acworth Georgia -- a little north of Atlanta to speak to a group that was having a fund raising golf tournament.
It was a beautiful day and a beautiful location.
Thanks to my friend Brenda for going over there with me.And, a few hours ago I got back from Atlanta after speaking to The Georgia Association of Homes & Services for the Aging workshop that was on "person centered care".
People from a broad spectrum of health facilities were there to hear what every one had to say.
Bob Balfour, another early stage patient from Atlanta and I were on a panel with Genny Helms from the Georgia Alzheimer's office.
Everyone was very receptive.
Hopefully, we made a difference -- even if it was only in a small way.
Thanks for inviting us and holding the conference.Tomorrow, we have a fund raiser for the Memory Walk.
Then, next week another event on Monday night and I'll be finished with boot camp.
Then I plan to rest!

I know I have been bad about updating this blog.
So sorry!
I'm off to Atlanta today and then again on Thursday and Friday for some Alzheimer's events.
I've still been going to boot camp.
My husband dropped out after two times.
That only leaves four of us left.
I won't kid you by saying it is easy.
I'm sore all the time!
I have one and half weeks left and hopefully by the time it is over I won't feel as bad.Happy birthday to my son today.
25 years old.
That makes me feel old, but by the same token if you had asked me five years ago if I would still be able to know it was his birthday I probably would have said no.
I'm happy about that.Our trip to Washington was fun.
We didn't do a whole lot, but we did get back down to the Newseum which has become one of my favorite places to go.
It is a museum about the News and is relatively new.
George Stephanopalus does his ABC Sunday show from there each week, and we went down on Sunday morning to see if he was there.
We got to see him, Cokie Roberts, George Will and Paul Krugman.
The next day Paul Krugman won the Nobel prize for economics.
Pretty neat, huh?
We got there just as they were finishing their taping so they were walking out of the studio.
They were all kind enough to say hello.Well I need to work on my remarks for today's Alzheimer's event.
I promise to try to do better about updating this blog.

<doc date=Tuesday, October 14, 2008>
We just got in from a long drive from Washington DC.
We visited Alan and Jennifer in their new apartment.
It's nice to know and see where they are living and calling home.
It was a quick trip.
Jennifer made me a birthday cake with her new Kitchenaid mixer and we ate it all weekend.
Thanks to both of them for making my birthday celebation a good one.
Alan turns 25 next week and that makes me feel older than me thinking about my own birthday!When I got back today I received an email that American Express has awarded the Alzheimer's Association 1.5 million dollars in their Members Project.
Thanks to all who voted.
One of our members of the Early Stage Advisory Group, Patty Smith, her husband actually put that project forward.
The project is to help with early detection of Alzheimer's Disease.
Last year there were a couple of other projects nominated and they both got high votes, but didn't win the top prize.
I was going to nominate an Alzheimer's project this year if one didn't get submitted, so I was glad to see Jay's project and so glad it won!
Thanks to Patty and Jay for all they do!
We were just near you but knew I didn't have time to get in touch.
Hope you are both doing well.More soon -- when I have rested.

I try to go to the gym on a pretty regular basis but I don't push myself.
I do a lot of things, but I honestly could do better.
So, I decided to "jump start" things by signing up for "boot camp".
Three days a week for an hour, being drilled -- and yes drilled is the best way to put it.
I have been wanting to do this for awhile and each time I was going to sign up my husband talked me out of it.
This time, I wasn't going to have that happen.
Instead, he decided to do it with me.
I think he was feeling guilty that he wasn't doing something "healthy" as well, so he decided to join me.
Well, that was probably a mistake.
Of course, he is a lot older than most of the people there and it is grueling.
I'm not sure if he'll make it for the whole month -- he says it is harder than army boot camp -- which I cannot imagine.
I think that it has been so long since he did that he has forgotten.
Anyway, it is getting better for me, not so much for him.
Today is was pouring down rain and we were outside doing our thing -- that's dedication don't you think?
We'll see if it really helps me motivate myself to work harder in the gym.
I figure I can't do much for my mind, so I might as well do someting for my body!We are going to visit Alan and Jennifer in Washington DC this weekend.
We are driving and I told my husband that we need to stop to take exercise breaks so we won't be so out of it when we return to boot camp next week.
He didn't seem to like that idea.

The art of letter writing has pretty much gone by the wayside with email and text messaging these days.
That is too bad.
I've always enjoyed letter writing -- as many of you may know.
When we were young and in school we were encouraged to have pen pals -- remember those days?
In fact, my oldest brother married his pen pal who lived in England and they have been married 40 years!
Right now, my sister-in-law's brother has been writing to me from England and it is so nice to go to the mail box and actually have a letter waiting for me some days.
I've enjoyed writing to him as well.I've written before about my letter writing to my son.
The day he was born I wrote him a letter and every year on his birthday I have written him a letter.
I put them all in the safety deposit box not knowing when the appropriate time to give them to him would be.
Since my Alzheimer's diagnosis these letters have become even more precious to me.
I'm able to share my feelings with him while I still can and when I can no longer remember what is going on at least he will know how I was feeling at some point.
I have struggled to know when the best time he should received these letters.
At first I thought it was when I died.
He knew that I wrote them and at some point he would get them.
Then, when he turned 21 I thought that would be the time.
But, I decided to give them to him the night before his wedding this last August.
We were alone together and I had gone to the safety deposit box to get all 25 letters out and put them in a box.
I thought since he was starting a new chapter in his life, that I would give them to him.
It was one of the hardest things I have done.
I shed quite a few tears and I'm not sure why.
His first reaction to me was -- "I don't want those now!".
I don't know if he thought that this was an "end" of some sort or what.
I told him that he didn't have to read them now -- he could read them five, ten or twenty years down the road.
I added a letter that he was to read first -- and that bascially told him that I didn't care when he read them, but once he did I wanted him to tell me that he had read them if I am still alive.
His other comment to me was "Does this mean you are going to stop writing me letters?"
My response to that was "I didn't say that!"
But, he has 25 letters from me now and who knows -- since his birthday is coming up I might write another to put away in the safety deposit box.
I guess my reason for giving him the letters now is for him to decide when the right time to read the letters would be -- not for me to decide.
Perhaps when my mind is to the point of not remembering him or what is going on it will bring some peace to him -- knowing how much he has meant to me through the years and how proud of him I am -- I may not be able to tell him that at some point and at least I know I'll have it covered!
I guess what made me write this post is that I just finished reading the book "Wednesday's Letters".
It is about a man who wrote his wife a letter every Wednesday that they were married.
He wrote them thinking that he would die before his wife and she would have them to read as a sign of his love.
I won't spoil the book for you -- but it turns out they die together and the children find the letters.
What ensues is a beautiful story and reminded me so much of my letters to my son.If you miss getting letters in the mail from friends, write one yourself to a friend.
You might get one back.

I'm here.
Every time I sit down to write something, the words don't come out right or I can't get my fingers to do what they need to do on the keyboard.
I find that I am making a lot of typing errors lately and it takes me forever to write something.I go back to the doctor tomorrow.
I have finished taking my daily B12 shots.
I feel a little better -- a little more energy anyway.
Not sure that the balance issues are any better.
We'll see what the doctor has to say about it.Lots of things have been happening with Alzheimer's related events.
It seems to get busy in the fall and spring.
Of course, our Memory Walk is in November.
With the economy the way it is, I'm sure that our fundraising efforts will be affected.
I am also still participating in a national study group about Alzheimer's issues.
Those serving with me include people for the National Institute on Aging, the Veteran's Administration, the Center for Disease Control, The Administrtion on Aging and the National Alliance for Caregiving.....just to name a few.
Our charge is to help define a national strategic plan for Alzheimer's.
I've also been appointed to a new "Senate Alzheimer's Disease and Other Dementia Study Commission" for the State of Georgia.
It will be dealing with various issues including safety of persons with Alzheimer's Disease, dementia care practices and recommendations, future needs for services and the state's responsibility.
The Senate resolution for this commission states that it must have a person with Alzheimer's Disease on the commission.
Also, I would like to remind everyone about the American Express Members Project.
If you are an American Express card holder and could vote of the Alzheimer's initiative, the Alzheimer's Assn.
has a chance of winning some money based on where the project ends up in the final list.
Right now, the Alzheimer's initiative is in first place.
There is still a ways to go so if you haven't voted, please do.
The website is http://www.membersproject.com/project/view/OGSSPKA shout out to a fellow blogger -- Dee in Canada.
Dee's mother has Alzheimer's and she chronicle's her time with her mother.
Thanks for your kind comments Dee and hang in there.
We are all in this together.

I know it has been awhile.
Thanks for all the emails and comments.
I've had so much to write that I couldn't get in all in a few paragraphs.Went back to the doctor last week after my MRI.
The MRI didn't show anything drastic like a tumor or a stroke -- which is a good thing.
My Vitamin B12 level is low so I am now giving myself daily injections of B12 for awhile.
I'm feeling a little better since the B12 shots have started to kick in -- more energy anyway.
I'm still having some numbing in my face and some problems on my right side, but we will see what the doctor says after looking at my MRI more closely.
I go back in a couple of weeks.College football is here in all its glory.
I enjoyed watching three games at once yesterday with my remote control in my hand clicking back and forth between games.
I have a hard time following a lot of times by switching back and forth, but I do it anyway.This week I'm catching up with some old friends.
I've been pretty bad about that lately because I have been traveling so much.
I have to pace myself and only schedule so many "events" for the week.
That's hard for me to do -- I can very easily "overbook" myself and then have several days of trying to rest up.
It's hard to say no to people.
I have lots of friends having birthdays this month and next and try to at least go to lunch with them for their special day.
It's hard keeping up with all of it.I promise to try to do better in the coming weeks of updating my blog.

Now that summer has come to an end I am hoping that I can get back into the swing of things -- which quite literally means getting back to my routine.
That has been lacking a bit this summer and I really need it.My neurologist's appointment this week didn't go so well.
The balance issues have gotten much worse and I am going to have another MRI.
Some other problems have cropped up as well so it is probably a good time for another one.
It has been 18 months since my last one, and we noticed a good bit of change on the last one from the previous one.
So, I'm anxious to see this one as well.
We probably won't know a whole lot for a few weeks.Our trip to Michigan was great.
It makes me miss the midwest -- the cooler temps, the drastic season changes, the cheap produce (including watermelon!
), and the lifestyle.
They say you can't go back home again, but it is sure nice to visit.My house needs cleaning, I have lots of scrapbooking to do from the summer and have to catch up on many things that have gone by the wayside this summer.
With all the travelling we did this summer -- between graduations and weddings, our family travelled over 35,000 miles in three months collectively.
When you are going from west coast to east coast several times that adds up.
But it was all worth it.
I still have some resting up to do and when I do I will post some more about our trip to Michigan.

Yes, it has been a long time.
Lots of things have been going on.
Jennifer and Alan are here for a few days and we leave this week to go to Michigan for another wedding.
I'm looking forward to going to the upper part of Michigan as I have never been there before.When I get back I have a neurologist's appointment.
I'm anxious to see him to talk about some issues I've been dealing with lately and talk to him about my balance issues as well.
Then I have to get serious about sticking to my diet more closely and exercising more routinely.
I've fallen into a rut lately -- and I definitely have to get out of it!!!
!We bought a Wii.
We haven't played with it much but with Alan and Jennifer here we have started with the Wii fit game.
It is very interesting -- but it is hard for me to do because you have to multi-task -- that's hard for me to do.
But, I guess it will be challenging for me because it will tax my brain some!
Hopefully, I can get better!More when I return -- everyone have a great Labor Day weekend.

This week was hard for me.
I was so totally exhausted that I think I slept most of the week away.
I tried to play golf with Ralph on Thursday, but had skip many holes because I was too tired and couldn't concentrate.
I'm feeling a little better but still need some rest.
Thanks to all of those that have sent emails and notes about the wedding.
It was a beautiful day and I was truly grateful to my friends and family for coming and helping me through the weekend.Jennifer and Alan are now honeymooning in Costa Rica.
They have found a place to live in Washington DC and will be moving the first part of September.In a few weeks, Ralph and I will be leaving to go to Michigan for a friend's wedding.
I'm looking forward to that trip as it will be a part of the country that I haven't seen before.
A true vacation I hope.More soon.

<doc date=Monday, August 04, 2008>
The last several days have been spent sleeping.
Traveling takes a lot out of me these days.
My awful trip back (as mentioned below) did not help matters much.
The day I was coming back the delay in my flight was long in Chicago and then when I got to Atlanta the airport was wall to wall people because of the delays in Atlanta.
I started having panic attacks because of all of the people and I could not get out of that airport fast enough.
I was almost running through the airport to get out of there.
I thought about trying to go into a rest room or somewhere where there weren't as many people and try to calm down, but I couldn't find anywhere where there weren't a lot of people!
I thought if I could just get out to the shuttle bus where they can get me to my car I'll be fine.
I got out there fast although it seemed like an eternity.
I finally got my heart rate down and started to relax.
It was raining a little but I didn't care.
I then got in my car to come home and there was a major accident on the major interstate I was coming home on.
While that didn't bother me too much, I was tired and I just wanted to get home.
Obviously I made it home -- but it really takes the fun out of traveling!We are getting into wedding mode here at the house.
My brother-in-law from St. Louis comes in on Wednesday and Alan will be home.
That is going to be four people in the house as opposed to our usual two.
I've told my husband already how hard that is going to be on me and that I need my quiet time and I need his help.
It's way too much confusion to have that many people in the house for me, let alone clean and cook.
I know my brother-in-law will understand when I just have to go into a room and shut the door for quiet time.
By week's end we will be staying at a hotel in Atlanta for the wedding and it will be easier for me to escape.
I really enjoy having company and seeing people, but it isn't like it used to be.
I get so tired so quickly and I'm not myself.
I hate this!!!

After a very very long trip yesterday I'm finally home from Chicago.
Between thunderstorms in Chicago and Atlanta and a very large car crash blocking traffic in Atlanta it was a long day.
More about that later.I was in Chicago for the International Conference on Alzheimer's Disease.
Over 5,000 people from around the world were there -- it was pretty impressive.
They are all trying to find a cure for this disease.
That's encouraging.
Of course, most of the sessions were so technical they were way over my head, but I hung in there for a few of them.
There are some exciting things in the pipeline -- it will just take years for the drugs to make it through our complicated process of clinical trials and the FDA.
I have to keep in my thoughts that there will be a breakthrough of some significance in the next ten years or so.Thanks to the BBC for their remarkable five part series on Alzheimer's this week.
I have had lots of comments on the show.
They filmed my story while I was in Washington in May for the Public Policy forum and it ran on Tuesday of this last week.
Here is the link if you missed it.
http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7532226.stm  On the page that this comes up on you will also find links to the other stories that ran.
It was a powerful series in all.
There was a lot of press last week on Alzheimer's with the conference going on.
And, Memory Walk commercials were running last week as well.
If you want more information on the conference you can get it at www.alz.org.
I will be writing more once I am rested.

<doc date=Wednesday, July 23, 2008>
I'm off to Atlanta in a few hours for a meeting there.
And, next week I have meetings in Atlanta and Chicago so I will be gone most of the week.
The week after that is THE wedding.
Then I will probably collapse and rest for a few weeks!A lot of events have taken place this summer with graduations and weddings.
I haven't had much time to reflect on them, but as I do think about them, I wonder when those events will be a long lost memory for me.
It's kind of weird to think of it like that, but what will I remember in the years to come of those events?
It's anyone's guess I suppose.
The words "living in the moment" seem appropriate at times like this.
These events will be memories for some, but most likely not for me.
Enjoy the time you have with loved ones!I noticed on the traffic on this site that I have had a few people in the armed forces looking at my blog.
My friend Josh is now serving "over there" and I hope it is he that is reading.
If it is, we miss you a lot Josh and our prayers are with you to remain safe.
That goes for everyone "over there" not just Josh.
Won't have much time to write until I return from Chicago next week.
Alan takes the bar next week so everyone cross your fingers for him.

It's been busy here.
Alan and Jennifer are back in Georgia.
Alan is spending time back and forth between here and Atlanta.
He was here for several days this week leaving the house full of laughter but also a mess!
It's always good to have him home though.
He is studying for the bar so we tried not to bother him too much.
Some close friends held a shower this past weekend for them and it was a lovely event.
There were about 25 people there and we enjoyed visiting with everyone.The latest issue of the Georgia chapter's newsletter is out.
Our trip to Washington DC is chronicled in there.
The web address is http://www.alz.org/georgia/documents/Summer08.pdfAugust 3rd the PBS channels will be showing the show "The Forgetting".
If you haven't seen this before it is worth watching.
It is based on the book by David Shenk and chronicles some families that have been living with this disease in their family as well as some of the technical aspects of the disease.
It came out several years ago but it is worth seeing again.
I'll also update you as we get closer to the BBC America series on Alzheimer's which is going to run at the end of the month.
It will be on the BBC America newshour at 7:00 p.m. eastern time (check your local listings).
It is a four part series dealing with Alzheimer's around the world.
It starts on July 28th.

Pictured above are 11 members of our National Early Stage Advisory Group I wrote about below.
This photo was taken when we were all in Washington in May.A month or so I wrote about Jim Nantz' book, Always By My Side.
After reading it, I wrote Mr. Nantz a note thanking him for sharing his story about his father who was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in 1995.
A few weeks ago, on June 28th, Jim Nantz' father passed away.
Today, I received a note from him thanking me for my letter -- that's a pretty class act.
Please read this book if you get a chance -- it's priceless.

<doc date=Monday, July 07, 2008>
I might have mentioned this before, but last month I rotated off of the National Alzheimer's Association Early Stage Advisory Group.
It was very rewarding and a lot of work.
I didn't really realize how much I missed it until this week -- when I realized I don't get as many emails as I use to!
Having fourteen other people on the board with me and dealing with all the wonderful folks at the national office, it seemed like every day I was getting an email from someone about some thing that needed to be tended to for the day -- or just a friendly hello from my peers.
Although I know we all share that special bond of serving for a year we will remain friends and support each other through our trials and tribulations with Alzheimer's, it's just different now and I miss it.
A new board has been chosen and I don't know who has been appointed to the board yet, other than two friends that have told me they have been selected.
They will enjoy their time on the board.
I'm still involved with one or two projects that are a carry over from the Early Stage Advisory Group, but they are now independent of the group.
I guess it is nice to know that you are needed and you can possibly do something to help.Ralph and I will be going to Atlanta on Wednesday to meet with Jennifer and Alan to work on some wedding details.
It will be here before you know it.
I keep trying my dress on hoping that the few pounds I have put on won't stop me from getting into it come August.
I guess it is a real motivator!I've also been trying to clean the house since we will have out of town company for the wedding.
It's amazing the stuff that you keep around.
Our Memory Walk committee is having a fund raiser yard sale in September so I am trying to keep the stuff around long enough to sell it -- but I don't have that much space.Some friends are giving Jennifer and Alan a shower this weekend.
It's so nice of them to do that.
I know it will be nice.I'm going to try to play golf again tomorrow.
We'll see if I can make it around the course without falling down!
</doc>
<doc date=Wednesday, July 02, 2008>
Every time I finish a post I think of something else to write.
Then, I forget it the next time I post!
Guess it goes with the terriroty!Another promising drug for Alzheimer's that was in the final stages of clinical trials has failed to provide enough data to end up being marketed.
Here is a link to the Alzheimer's website for more information.
Last year, the same thing happened with another drug.
We just need to keep trying.
http://alz.org/news_and_events_13918.aspI played golf yesterday and with my balance issues I wasn't sure I was going to do so well.
But, I did o.k.
-- however, I did use my pull cart and my golf club as a cane.
I had a few moments when I thought I was going to fall but I didn't.
I think I must look like someone who is drunk!
Today, it seems to be a little better.
Jennifer and Alan are on the move from California.
They had some car trouble yesterday so they had unexpected delay (and somewhat costly) but I told Alan on the phone that at least they were not in an accident and they are o.k -- even though they won't be home on the day they planned.My nephew that just got married, passed his dissertation for his doctorate in child psychology last week.
Congratulations Jonathan!
I'm so proud of him -- he has worked really hard for this and will be working at a school district in upstate Illinois in the fall.
It's nice to have a "Dr." in the family.Hope everyone has a great Fourth of July -- at least for the Americans reading this blog.

The weekend is over and ended with a huge thunderstorm.
The wind blew over a tree about a block down the street and knocked down some power lines.
We were without power for 6 hours.
It was about 9:00p.m.
when it happened.
It was extremely warm in the house so we had to open all the windows.
The bad part was that a fire truck was sitting idly in front of our house until the power company could come.
The power company showed up around 2:00 a.m. with chain saws and started cutting up the tree.
Finally the power was restored, all trucks left and I could finally go to sleep.
The tree fell on a car parked on the street, but luckily there were no fires and no one was hurt that I am aware of.
We think the wind blew the tree over but ther was some powerful lightning in the area but none of the neighbors heard anything that sounded like lightning striking the tree.Balance issues were plaguing me a great deal this weekend.
I'm not liking this one bit.
I met three other ladies for brunch yesterday and had difficulty walking to the buffet line and out the door.
I held on to someone to help me the rest of the way.
Around the house I'm just sure not to "walk with sharp objects in my hand".I forgot to mention that we had our captain's meeting for this year's Memory Walk about a week and a half ago.
With the economy the way it is this year it may be a little more difficult to raise money but we are certainly going to try.
A new friend of mine from Atlanta came over to speak to our group -- her mother is "young" like I am and has the disease.
She did a great job.
Last week I went to an assisted living center about 20 miles away that has a monthly support group and talked to them.
They were great and it did me good to get out and speak.
I say that it is as much therapy for me as it is for them.
It's likely to be a slow week this week with the holiday.
Jennifer and Alan are driving to Georgia from California starting today.
They are hoping to be in Atlanta by week's end.
Ralph wants to play golf tomorrow, but I'm not sure if I can play with the balance issue.
Guess I'll have to wait and see.Everyone have a great week.

I have been having some problems lately.
Nightmares have plagued me for awhile now.
Not only do I get them at night but when I take a nap.
Most of the time someone is torturing me -- not sure what that is all about but it is very scary.
It leaves me tired because I'm not sleeping well.
Which makes me not to want to go exercise.....which leads to other things.The other problem I have been having is a problem with balance.
I know this is an Alzheimer's related problem and I haven't experienced it before.
I'm falling down and having difficulty stabilizing myself sometimes.
I am hoping that this is something that is off and on, more off than on!

<doc date=Tuesday, June 24, 2008>
I haven't posted in a while.
Lots going on but can't seem to put everything into words.
Plus, I'm fighting a cold so I haven't had much energy.
I have a speaking engagement this evening so I will probably try to rest a good bit today.
Don't have much else planned this week except for a couple of conference calls for Alzheimer's business.Have enjoyed watching the UGA Baseball team in their quest for a College World Series title.
If they win this evening, they will win the title.
Ralph and I are still dealing with Social Security.
They paid us one of my disability payments but have yet to pay the lump sum of over $55,000 still owed to us.
We were awarded our judgment at the end of January.
One payment since then.
It's a pretty pathetic system.
I get confused dealing with them and the insurance company that still pays my long term disability payments through my last employer, so Ralph has to do most of the talking.
I think it frustrates him as well.
Alan is in Washington DC this week interviewing for some clerkship jobs for the '09 year.
Yes, he does have a job with a firm in Washington for the coming year and they know he is doing this.
They work with those that want to take a leave for a short time to do clearkships and that is a wonderful thing.
He and Jennifer leave California on Monday to head back "home".
They are busily selling off things before moving.
More soon.

I mentioned in my blog a few days ago about how saddened I was at Tim Russert's untimely death.
Of course, I didn't know him, but was very sad by his loss, as was it seems the nation.
I have been watching lots of the coverage that has aired on all the stations recently and realize what a "larger than life" person he was.
He touched so many lives.
His son Luke, is a testament to his father.
I cried openly yesterday as I listened to his son giving a loving tribute to his father.
You look at a young man like that and realize his future is bright and going to be filled with great things.
How proud his family must be of him.
For someone to only be 22 years of age and command the respect he did is truly amazing.
There are many wonderful and amazing young people out there that we don't get to see much of.
They are making their way into the world and we will hear from them in due time I am sure.I'm sure my son is reading this at some point and he knows how proud I am of him.
I thought of him a lot yesterday while watching Luke Russert speak, thinking that he reminded me a lot of Alan.
Alan has a few years on him and has not had the privileges that Luke has enjoyed but they both seem to have worked hard to get where they have gotten and are very mature for their age.
I know that all parents are proud of their children and we probably don't tell them enough what they mean to us.
It's never too late to tell them.
Alan shared with us last night that he was ranked in the top ten percent of his graduating law school class at Stanford and for a class size of 180 that is pretty good.....it's actually better than pretty good!
I think I used the word amazing last night but I don't think that is the proper word either!
It is well deserved.
You did good kid!
Now go pay off that law school debt!!

I continue to get lots of comments from the recent articles and many phone calls as well.
Thanks for all your support.
To "grits" -- if you will email me at krisbga@hotmail.com I will be glad to answer your questions.One of our advisory board participants is interviewed by US News and World Report.
His story appears here http://www.usnews.com/blogs/planning-to-retire/2008/06/17/second-career-plans-scuttled-by-illness.htmlThis has been a rough week for me.
I have lots of unfinished business to take care of and I'm not able to get it done.
This, too, shall pass.

Yesterday was Father's Day.
After my father passed away, many many years ago it was difficult for me to go into a card store where they sold Father's Day cards.
And, sometimes, even now it is difficult for me to look at the cards celebrating Father's Day.
I felt especially sad this weekend when I heard the news about NBC's moderator of Meet the Press, Tim Russert's passing.
Of course I didn't know him, but I felt as if I did.
And, I know from watching him for so many years, he was so proud of his son Luke.
I kind of felt like part of my family passed away with him and I know that sounds silly.
But, I really enjoyed watching him.
I particularly liked his book "Big Russ and Me" about his father and their relationship.
I remember reading that and thinking that many times he was describing my relationship with my father.....which was indeed special.
He's been gone for 25 years and I still miss him.Go hug your father, mother, son or daughter.

<doc date=Tuesday, June 10, 2008>
is the name of the book that sportscaster Jim Nantz just wrote about his father who suffers from Alzheimer's.
I have been a big fan of Mr. Nantz's for a long time.
So, I was very interested in his book.
It talks about the special relationship he has with his dad, and how the sports career that he has had has influenced his life.
It is an easy read and I really enjoyed the book.
If you are not a sports fan, though, I am not sure you would enjoy it as much.
Since I'm kind of a sports junkie I could relate to many of the stories he told because I remember them and I've kept up with lots of the players in the book over the years.
His relationship with his father, and other people, like former President Bush (#41) is very interesting to read about.
The struggles they have faced with Alzheimer's in the Nantz family are no different than the ones faced by you and I, but he puts a different spin on it.
I would certainly recommend the book.It has been extremely hot here (as it has in other parts of the nation).
I got a little dehydrated over the weekend so it has taken me a few days to recover.
I'm suppose to be playing golf tomorrow but it is only suppose to be in the low 90's -- as compared to over 100 degree temperatures for several days here this past weekend.Things are kind of quiet around our household these days.
That's good -- it is the calm before the storm I know but it is still good.
T-Minus 61 days until Alan and Jennifer's wedding.

Well, this week started out pretty quiet.
I think I needed that.
I was having a hard time getting my thoughts clear enough to getting much accomplished around the house.
Once the news article ran, my blog got lots and lots of hits and I really appreciate the notes and comments that have been left for me.
I haven't published all of them for various reasons, but please know how much that means to me.
Hearing from others diagnosed young is always nice, although I wish it weren't the case.
There are many many people out there speaking out with the disease and I thank all of them for standing up to it and making a difference.
Together, we can all fight this!
I heard Jim Nantz (CBS Sports reporter) on the news today talking about a new book he had written about his father who has Alzheimer's.
Jim Nantz has always been one of my favorite broadcasters and I'm anxious to read what he has to say -- it sounds like a great tribute to his father.It's extremely hot here in the south these days.
I went to a baseball game today and it was well over 90 degrees.
Zapped me of much of my energy but at least I was able to go.
Last week I went to one and it was so noisy and I wasn't having such a good day, that I wasn't able to last long.
But I try!

<doc date=Wednesday, June 04, 2008>
I must say that since the article recently written by Lauran Neergaard of the Association Press on Early Stage Alzheimer's has been released, the traffic on this website has increased significantly.
I hope that those of you that are looking at this and are seeking more help about Alzheimer's will go one step further and contact the Alzheimer's Association if you need more information.After my initial diagnosis the first place I went to was my local Alzheimer's Association and asked for the help.
I basically said, "I'm 46, have Alzheiemer's --what am I suppose to do".
And, although they can't offer a cure, they have certainly been with me every step of my journey since finding out I had this disease.
Many of us are writing about our experiences since being diagnosed.
Some days it is harder than others to put into words what we are feeling and experiencing.
So, there are some days you will read this and not see anything about Alzheimer's.
I can't dwell on it all the time, and the reason for this blog is more to let my friends and family in on what I'm going through when it is appropriate to do so.
Early on in my diagnosis they would ask me "How are you feeling?"
and I would just say "fine" instead of going on in detail how difficult some things had been for me.
Through this, though, as things happen I can share the experience of living with Alzheimer's.
It's not always fun sharing, but sometimes it can be funny.
It's easier to laugh at myself when I do stupid things, than to admit how stupid I feel when I do things!
I don't always get it in the right words, but I try, and that, in essence what this blog is all about.Thanks to Lauran for writing the article and hope that it helps start more of a dialogue about early stage Alzheimer's.

I think that all my traveling has finally caught up with me.
I'm extremely tired and have been fighting "the blues" as of late.
Every little thing seems to bother me way more than it should.
Hopefully, this too, will pass.I've mentioned the book Still Alice before on my blog and I know that many of you have had a chance to read it.
I heard from the author today that her book was picked up by a major publisher and will be in bookstores beginning the first part of 2009.
Congratulations Lisa -- what a great accomplishment to you.
I think anyone who reads the book will certainly understand the trials and tribulations of dealing with Alzheimer's through Alice and her family.I'm closing now because I can't quite seem to get my thoughts together to write much more.
I will try again in a few days.

<doc date=Thursday, May 29, 2008>
I'm not sure my life is ever "normal".
But, I'm probably back to being as normal as it can be -- at least for a month or so.
Alan is back in California so the house will be quieter (and less messy).
I'm back to my routine and that's important.
I'm still extrememly tired from our trip but I have lots of days to rest up.
My husband has a nasty cold and keeps me up at night coughing, but last night I was able to go into Alan's room and sleep so I got some rest.Alan and Jennifer's wedding is August 10th.
They have just started a website www.alanandjennifer.com .
They will be posting information on it as they firm up more details.
They will be moving back to Atlanta the first week of July, Alan takes the bar at the end July, then the wedding, honeymoon and the move to Washington DC.
So, I have about a month before things start getting a little busier.More soon.

<doc date=Monday, May 26, 2008>
Yes, there is a new look to this page.
I'm not quite used to it yet.
My son helped me with it and I'm sure I'll make a few changes as the days and months go by.
We finally made it back home today and I'm so glad to see my little house.
It will take me quite awhile to rest up but I wanted to post this photo of the new bride and groom, Kathy and Jonathan Stagg.
I'm so happy for them.More soon!

<doc date=Sunday, May 25, 2008>
I'm still on the road -- will be back tomorrow night (Monday).
It's been a long and tiring trip but I'm glad we made it.
I'm glad Jennifer could come in from California, because as I said in one of m previous posts, it is probably the last time my family will be together.
She got to meet a lot of people that she has only heard about and some that I haven't seen in a long time.
One of my sister-in-laws is originally from England.
She and my brother have been married for almost 40 years.
Two of her brothers and one of her sisters came over for the wedding.
One of her brothers was here 38 years ago when I was just 14 -- mind you he was only 18 at the time!
I met her other brother at some point when he came visiting and I had never met her sister.
So, it was certainly a special time for all of us.
The wedding was great -- real laid back but everyone had fun.
I'll post a few photos when I get back.it will be nice to get back to a routine.
Alan leaves to go back to San Francisco on Wednesday and then life will be a little more "normal".
After jennifer and Alan move back in july it will be full steam ahead for their wedding.It was an emotional week for me.
Hard to deal with some things, hard to let go of some things.
I've become much more emotional though in the last few years so it doesn't take much!!!!
I lost my necklace that a dear friend gave me about ten years ago.
I never took that necklace off -- i loved it so much.
I had always admired other women who had something from their husbands like a necklace that they never took off.
My husband never gave me anything like that.
One year for my birthday a very dear friend from Illinois sent me a necklace that had a small pendant on it.
It was oblong and had the word love on one side, and then the word love was spelled in Chinese on the reverse.
It was very simple but beautiful and i fell in love with it when I saw it.
I knew that once I put it on I wouldn't take it off.
i got so many compliments on it.
Then, the chain broke when I was in Peoria this week and I lost the pendant.
I have no idea when or where it broke but it did and I was so sad to have that gone.
It really meant a lot to me.
I got very emotional over that.
I know that sounds silly, but it wasn't just the necklace, it was the thought that my friend would have taken time to buy it for me - he has such good taste and he knows how much I have worn that.
I'm going to hate to have to tell him.Enough about that.
I'm using Alan's keyboard and I don't like it, hence the capitalization errors in this post.
I'll try to clean it up later.More when I get home.

I'm leaving today for Illinois for my nephew's wedding.
Have a lot of things to do before going so this is going to be short.
I've enjoyed people's emails and notes from the Public Policy forum.
I'm still digesting everything that happened and making follow up calls to legislators that I met with.
I've also done a media interview since then.
A young gentleman sang at the Candlelight vigil that we had, Ken Johnson.
His songs were very emotional and you can check one out here on you tube.
I hope this link works!http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaRexAgjWugMore when I return from the wedding.

My husband has been gone for five days.
He and my son are driving from Palo Alto to Illinois.
It has been heaven to have the house to myself and the quiet.
I know I have written about this before, but you have no idea how much better I do by myself in solitude.
I don't have to have the distraction of the television or from my husband.
I don't realize how much it affects me until I get my quiet time alone.
There isn't much that can be done about it since my husband has retired and is home all the time, but I relish my quiet time alone.
I have a few more days of peace.In a couple of days I'll be flying to Illinois to meet the guys and Jennifer will fly in from California to meet us for my nephew's wedding.
Adjusting to all of that will be hard after my almost week of solitude!
This wedding, however, will probably be the last time that my whole family will be together.
It's kind of weird to think about that.
I have two brothers, one that is 13 years older than me and another that is only two years older.
My oldest brother is not in good health so I don't think he will be able to travel to Alan's wedding this summer.
I have a niece who is living in Nevada who will be back for the wedding in Illinois, but probably not for Alan's wedding either.
So, I guess this is the time to take all the photos we can as it will probably be the last time we are all together.
Growing up I thought our family was pretty "normal".
But, looking back I can see that it was anything but that.
Funny how your perspective changes as you get older isn't it?On another note,  a friend of mine that I used to work with called me this morning and her brother passed away yesterday at the age of 48 from a heart attack.
Since I'll be gone to Illinois I will miss the services and funeral and I hate that -- I don't think I have been as good a friend to her as she has been to me, and, for that I feel bad.
I have to do better by that.More before I leave.

At least it was sunny that day as it had been raining very hard the first three days.

Just got back today from Washington.
I promise to post more about the trip.
I hope you saw all the press about the conference and Sandra Day OConnor speaking at a senate committee hearing for increased funding.
The Washington Post did a great article and there is also a video from the town hall meeting.The video is about 5 minutes long and you might enjoy seeing it.
I promise to get to all the comments that have been left for me shortly.http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/05/13/AR2008051303349.html?wpisrc=newsletterYou may have to cut and past this address into your browser.

I said I would blog while I was in DC and I have been a little busy.
It's been raining a good bit and Alan came in on Friday.
We went to the Newseum -- a new museum about the news industry.
It was fabulous and we spent 4.5 hours there.
I could have stayed all day.
Then we went to a Washington Nationals game which wasn't so good as they lost 11-0.
Then we played 18 holes of golf on Mother's day.
The best part of Mother's Day was that I got to actually spend Mother's Day with my son for the first time in three years.Now the conference has started and we had our Town hall meeting this morning.
I left it early and as I write this some people from the BBC America are filming this for a piece they are doing on Alzheimer's disease.
I will let you all know when it is going to air.
There is a lot of press here for the conference which is great because we need the publicity.
It was encouraging today that so many people stood up at the Town Hall meeting to speak.
They shared information and it was a good exchange.
Tonight there is a Candlelight vigil somewhere near the capitol where one of our early stage advisory group members is going to speak.
It should be rather emotional.
I am hoping that the rain will stop and we will have some people there.
Tomorrow we have a full day of meetings and then on Wednesday we will be going to Capitol Hill to meet with our legislators.
The BBC film crew is coming to Capitol Hill with me so at least I will have our legislators attention with a film crew in tow.
To many of you that have asked -- the two year wait for Medicare is also big on the agenda here and we are hoping to make some impact on that subject as well as increased funding for research.
So,to all of those that have asked me to speak about that -- I am and I hope we will be able to see the fruits of our labor.I will write more when I can.

Got into Washington yesterday afternoon.
When I got in, the entire terminal looked different to me.
I realized that I had never flown Airtran into Washington DC before -- always Delta.
So, I got really confused and disoriented.
I had a panic attack and then asked for some help to get my bags and a taxi.
Once I got to the hotel it was fine, but needless to say I didn't venture out much on my own!
I did get to have a nice rest before meeting up with colleagues for dinner.Today we have three interviews scheduled.
The weather is pretty bad -- bad storms last night and lots of rain this morning.Alan will arrive tonight and that will certainly help me.

<doc date=Wednesday, May 07, 2008>
I'm off to Washington DC tomorrow.
Two days between trips isn't quite enough for me.
Plus, I'm getting a cold my son had over the weekend.
When I get to DC tomorrow I think I have about one day of rest before things get busy.BBC America is going to do a piece on Alzheimer's while I am in Washington and they will be interviewing my son and I and following us during the conference.
The piece sounds promising so I'll let you know when it migh air.While I was in California I recieved the loveliest note from someone who heard me speak in Macon a couple of weeks ago.
She is a cancer survivor and has some struggles of her own.
It was so nice to recieve her note and for her to take the time and trouble to contact me after the event.
I look forward to getting to know her better.Several weeks ago I mentioned that I was reading the Story of Forgetting, a new book out about Early on set Alzheimer's.
I finished the book and I didn't like it all that much.
It was very complicated for me to follow and it was certainly a different approach to the subject.
Many books are very emotional that deal with this subject and it wasn't -- which is o.k.
-- it was a little too technical at times if anything.
And, there was a lot of symbolism in it and I'm not sure I caught all of it.
It was a very hard read for me.
My favorite book so far is Still Alice by Lisa Genova and Losing My Mind by Thomas DiBaggio.
Someone left a note on my blog about the latter book and it was one of the first books I read after being diagnosed.
My son had given it to me for Mother's Day the first year of my diagnosis.
I'm sure others will like the Story of the Forgetting -- it just wasn't for me.My son will be joining me in Washington DC to help me maneuver -- I don't travel so well by myself anymore.
Although I just saw him last week -- it will be nice to be with him on Mother's Day.
And, Happy Mother's Day to all of those mothers out there reading this.I'm going to try to blog from the road.

I got a pleasant surpise in the mail today -- Michael Feinstein sent me three CD's.
When we were together last week we were talking about his CD's and he told me he was going to send me some.
And, they came today.
I didn't really expect them -- but now they will be downloaded on to my IPOD for my upcoming trips.We are getting ready for the trip to California.
I'm looking forward to it.
We probably won't be out there for awhile since Alan and Jennifer will be moving to the East Coast.
I'll miss an occasional visit out there.I'm also trying to gear up for the Public Policy Forum in Washington DC the Alzheimer's Association is having the next week.
I'll be home for two days and then off to Washington.
It will be a very busy time for me and I hope I can keep up.
I'm going in a few days early as the Association has interviews set up for me with the Associated Press, AARP, and the BBC.
Alan is coming with me on this trip to help me maneuver my way around.
It will be fun to have some quiet --if you can call it that -- time with him.
At least we will be together on Mother's Day and that means a lot to me.
During the conference he and I will be going with members of our State Alzheimer's office to lobby on Capitol Hill for more funding for Alzheimer's research.
We have meetings set up with Congressmen Price, Lewis, Westmoreland and Deal as well as Senators Isakson and Chambliss.
A very busy agenda as you can see.
During the Washington trip we will also have our last meeting of the Early Stage Advisory Group that I have been associated with the past year.
It has been a rewarding experience and I have gotten to meet some great people who also serve on that committee.Our state Alzheimer's Association has a new Executive Director that I met last week.
I'm anxious to get to work with her as well.
A lot still needs to be done!

As you can see by the photos, I got to meet Michael Feinstein last night.
The fund raiser was great and the development director in Macon, Karen Kinsler, did a great job putting it together.
I spoke a few minutes before Michael came out and met with him briefly after the show.
He is doing alot to help raise awareness for Alzheimer's and to help raise money.
It was a great evening.
Today has been a hard day for me because the day was pretty long yesterday and I'm very tired.
Things are"hazy" for me at best at times today.
I did get to take a little nap before I had a meeting this afternoon for the Memory Walk, but putting this post together has been difficult.
I'm glad I have the weekend to rest up.
We'll be off to California next week.

<doc date=Thursday, April 24, 2008>
Tonight there is a fund raiser in Macon for the Alzheimer's Association featuring pianist, singer Michael Feinstein.
He has always been a favorite of mine.
In my previous job as theatre director in Athens, he was always on my "short list" of entertainers I wanted to have come perform.
Well, it never happened.
But tonight, I will get a chance to hear him perform live and also get to meet him briefly.
I've been asked to say a few words before the concert and I'm looking forward to the evening.The weather is beautiful here this week and I've been enjoying being outside.
The pollen count is pretty high -- but it is worth it.
We played golf yesterday and I played better than Ihave played for a long time, but I was well rested before hitting the course so I think that helped.More when we return from Macon.

One thing that seems to be real universal with everyone that I know that has Alzheimer's is the lack of being able to deal with math.
I can't make change anymore.
I just usually give the clerks a twenty and they give me change back.
Today I was in Borders bookstore and my bill came to $27.45.
I handed the lady $17.00 in cash.
She tried to explain to me that I was short -- I understood what she was saying but I couldn't wrap my mind around it in order to give her more money.
I just stood there not believing I couldn't figure it out.
Needless to say, I got frustrated and took the money back and gave her a credit card.
I always joke that "God made credit cards" for those with Alzheimer's that can't handle money.
It makes you feel so stupid that you can't figure something as simple as that -- and I didn't want to tell the lady why I couldn't make the change in the first place!
How frustrating.The book I did buy at Borders is called "The Story of Forgetting" about a family dealing with Early On Set Alzheimer's with several members of their family.
If anyone has read it yet, please let me know what you think.
I've read some good reviews on it.Speaking of money........$7.99 for a watermelon at the grocery store?
I don't think so!
Talk about sticker shock!
If gas prices weren't bad enough!And, the last thing about money -- I have to have yet another crown -- another $1,000 to my dentist!
What fun.
My husband said with all the crowns I've had lately that that was my trip to Australia --- considering that is probably never going to happen anyway -- I guess he is right.

<doc date=Sunday, April 20, 2008>
This week my husband and I have been volunteering for a golf tournament.
My husband has been working more than I have because it is just too much for me.
I had forgotten how much better it is for me when there is no one in the house with me......silence is golden.
After I retired, my husband was still working and I had about two years here at home by myself.
The television was never on, the radio was never on and my peaceful day was bliss.
After he retired that all changed -- I had to suddenly become use to the noise of the television, someone else in my space, and the constant need to be "on" -- since I had someone else around who was expecting me to communicate.
If you knew me before I had Alzheimer's you would have agreed with me that being in a quiet still environment would not have been what I wanted, I would have gone crazy in no time flat.
But the distractions that just one person has on me is tremendous.
This week while he has been gone most of the day have been so much better for me.....I haven't been as tired as I usually am and have just felt better.
There's nothing I can do about the situation since my husband is retired -- I know he isn't going to get another job!
We have tried "quiet rooms" and that works to some extent, but it's not perfect.
My husband likes to do things together so when he plays golf he wants me to go with him.
Sometimes, I just find myself having to say no because I need that quiet time.
It sounds awful selfish I know, and I feel bad about it.I have one more day to myself and I'm going to enjoy the sounds of silence.

Watching the Masters tournament yesterday was exciting.
As much as I enjoy Tiger Woods, it is nice to see someone else get that Green Jacket.
The Masters tournament is so special.
I have been fortunate to go to the tourney (practice rounds) twice and the course so magnificent it literally can take your breath away.
The first time I saw it I just gasped.
I think I did that when I saw Pebble Beach in California as well.
I might not be able to play real well, but I can appreciate the courses.My husband and I are volunteering this week at a Nationwide PGA event.
We have done this for the last couple of years.
However, I have had to cut my hours back every year because it is a little much for me but I can help a day or two.
It's nice being outside anyway!To Kristi -- the college student that is working on a research paper -- I tried to email you but it came back as undeliverable.

This has been a weird week for me.
I've been unusually depressed about a lot of thins -- and of course--those are things that are out of my control.
I know I shouldn't worry about them because there is nothing I can do, but I do.
And, more so now than before.
I try to rationalize it instead of feeling trapped by these things, but I can't.
It's harder for me to process my feelings and that is frustrating in itself.
Several specific things came up this week that really made me sad and helpless --that I couldn't do something to make it right.
But, I can't and know one can.
Life is like that sometimes.I've also been extremely tired.
I haven't been sleeping well and I think it might have all caught up with me.
Therefore, I too, am not thinking as straight as I should be.My husband and I are doing an interview tomorrow with a UGA student who is doing a project on demintia.
Her grandfather passed away with Alzheimer's and she is a media student at UGA.
She has a magazine article to write and she also needs to do a video project.
So she and her "crew" will be here tomorrow to do that and then it is rest for the weekend.
We are volunteering to work at a golf tournament that is in town next week.
It will be our third year in doing this.
This year, I can't do as much as I used to.
It is too much for me but a couple of days I can handle.
I feel bad not working every day, but I learned my lesson last year that I have to be better to myself and pace myself.
In three weeks we make the trek to California for Alan's graduation.
I'm looking forward to seeing he and Jennifer since it has been Christmas since we saw them last.
It's taken me forever to write this as I have had to back and look at the grammar over and over.
I'm sure I have missed a few things, but hopefully you can read it.
More after I have some rest.

Yesterday was the Town Hall meeting in Atlanta.
Almost 100 people drove through some pretty rough rain and weather to get to the meeting.
We were very pleased with the turnout and the results.
I was so pleased that so many people spoke up and shared their stories.
The Association did a great job in getting prepared and facilitating the meeting.
I was especially moved by the people who find themselves still waiting for social security and for the system to catch up with them.
It is so sad that this is the way it is, when it doesn't have to be.
Many were forced from their jobs and the stories become all too familiar.
Thanks to those who came up to me and said they have been following this blog.
I never know who is going to read this and to those that do I say thank you.
Many times I don't know what I'm going to write when I sit down at the keyboard.
I find people do wade through some of the nonsense that I publish here -- and I appreciate their patience with me as I struggle to write sometimes.But yesterday was extremely exhausting for me.
I realized about mid way through the session that I didn't have as much "reserve" as I thought I did so it was hard to keep going.
I was able to catch a catnap on the way home from Athens which helped a little.
But then, I tried to watch NCAA basketball last night and kept falling asleep.
Every time I would wake up I would catch the score watch a little more and then fall asleep again.
Hopefully, I can stay awake for the women's games tonight.

It's cold and rainy here today.
Two days ago it was in the low 80's.
Yesterday the high was in the upper 40's.
Sunday it is suppose to be 70.
Go figure.
The pollen is out in full force and everyone in town is sniffling or sneezing whether they have allergies or not.Tomorrow is the Town Hall Meeting in Atlanta for Early Memory Loss.
I hope the turnout is good.
There seems to be a good number pre-registered.
I'm glad the chapter is doing this as they have not done a lot in the past for the early stage folks.
We'll see how well this goes over.I've been trying to take it easy this week.
I'm trying to better pace myself, but that really takes a lot of discipline on my part and that isn't always easy for me to do.
But if I don't I get so exhausted that I'm not very good for a few days so I need to be better.More on Sunday.

was funny.
It's definitely for mature audiences but it is worth seeing if you get a chance.
Russ, I didn't get your comment until I returned home to Athens.
Sorry I missed you.
I saw Sunshine but she was busy and I didn't want to bother her.It's just starting to rain in Athens.
It poured while we were leaving the show in Atlanta.
I hope the rain can wash a little of the pollen away.

Well, I'm back from Norfolk.
Our women's team got bounced in the second round of the NCAA tourney.
A disappointing loss needless to say.I'm extremely tired from the trip.
I slept most of the day yesterday and felt as if I was a step behind all day.
Today I am very anxious.
I'm upset about a couple of things that happened in my absence and I don't really know why.
I think I am probably more upset with myself about letting these things get to me, but just the same, I'm upset.
I'll get over it.
I usually do -- it just takes me longer these days to let go of things.
It's one of those days where I could sit around and cry all day.
I used to have more of those days.
I need to enjoy the day -- it is suppose to be sunny and nice outside.
Maybe I just need some fresh air.

I'm writing this from the hotel in Norfolk Virginia.
Our women's basketball team (UGA) pulled out a win today against Iowa.
It was a very close game and exciting down to the end.
We now play No.
1 Ranked UNC (in our regional) on Tuesday night.
It's been a long day for me with all the excitement.
I bowed out of dinner tonight because I was just too tired and knew that it would be too much for me.
I need my rest.
Yesterday was a long day with the ride and I was pretty tired at dinner last night.
I need to pace myself on this trip.I hope everyone had a great Easter.
More soon.

I should have put this in my new post below, but I forgot -- imagine that.
Today the National Alzheimer's Association released its updated facts and figures about Alzheimer's disease.
Here is the link http://www.alz.org/alzheimers_disease_facts_figures.aspIt's pretty amazing.
Also, this week starts a media campaign in print and nationwide media about Alzheimer's.
Hope you get to see some of the spots.And, the book Still Alice which I have mentioned before is getting a lot of press these days.
There was a review of the book in the Boston Globe a few days ago.
Here is the link There's a fantastic article about STILL ALICE in today's Boston SundayGlobe!
Here's the link if you'd like to see it.http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2008/03/16/despite_monster_she_is_still_alice?p1=email_to_a_friendThis book is great -- get it now.

Was in Atlanta and Albany Georgia this week on Alzheimer's business.
I had the pleasure of speaking to a group of Caregivers in Albany.
The group was really great and so many people came up to me afterwards and shared their stories.
It is heartbreaking to hear what everyone has to go through with this disease.
I learn so much from them.
I appreciate them asking me to come and speak.
It always helps me to listen to others that are struggling with the care giving aspect of this terrible disease.You have probably heard about the awful storms that went through Atlanta last night.
They think it was a tornado and the damage is still being assessed.
I think they are fortunate there were not any lives lost in the devastation.
I'm still tired from the trip this week.
More soon.

I'll be off line for a few days.
Have meetings in Atlanta and Albany Georgia this week.I have been thinking about all the young lives we hear of being taken these days.
I guess it is on my mind since the UNC student that was killed was from Athens.
My son is 24 years old and I look back at some of the friends he has lost due to car accidents, hom invasions and suicide.
I don't remember young people dying like that when I was young.
Perhaps it happened and we just didn't hear about it.
It is so tragic.
And, then of course, we have all the young lives lost overseas in the war.
It just makes you want to hug your kids and never let go.This past weekend CBS news ran a story about an Atlanta couple dealing with Alzheimer's.
I'm fortunate to know this couple and the piece was really good.
The husband has early on-set Alzheimer's and is dealing with it with other members of his family as well.
One thing that was striking to me is when they interviewed his wife Trish she said  something to the effect of -- if we sat around and were depressed about this we would be missing out on a lot of quality time together.
Forgive me Trish if I messed this up -- but it is so true.
Time spent feeling sorry for yourself robs you of the good time you have left.

Well -- we just got back from Nashville.
We lost in the second round of the basketball tournament which was not very good!
It snows about four inches in Nashville last night and getting back to the hotel from the arena was pretty slow going.
There was a lot of ice underneath the snow so it was slippery.
We waited for the roads to clear before we headed home today.
I'm glad we are home -- I'm tired and I have a long week in front of me.Many of you may have heard or read about the young lady that was murdered at UNC in Chapel Hill.
She was the student body president and she is from here -- Athens, Georgia.
I know her father and I can't imagine what that family is going through.
The details of her murder are a little sketchy to me because I have been out of the news loop.
She was so well loved and was the valedictorian of her high school here in Athens.
What a shame to lose a life that young.More when I get rested and before I leave for Albany this week.
Thanks again to all of those that responded, sent comments and emails from the Alzheimer's Assn.
post last week.

<doc date=Thursday, March 06, 2008>
to the hundreds of people who logged on to this blog after reading my story on the Alzheimer's Association website.
I'm so glad that people are using the internet to find out more about Alzheimer's.
Thanks, too, for the comments you have left -- I appreciate the feedback.
If you want to leave a comment with your email address I promise to get back to you personally and to not publish your email address.
I'd also like to say that if you are in Georgia and around the Atlanta area on April 5th, the Georgia Chapter of the Alzheimer's Assn.
is hosting a "Town Hall Meeting" for those with early stage Alzheimer's or dementia.
It is free but you must sign up.
Information will be posted on the Georgia website soon so please check it out.
www.alz.org/georgia.
These Town Hall meetings have been taking place all over the country and if you check the national website  at http://www.alz.org/townhall/ you can find out more information.
Thanks again for reading my ramblings.
Some days are better than others -- so check back often!

Many of you are probably aware of Facebook on the internet.
For some odd reason, several months ago I decided to see what it was all about.
I've known about it for a long time and my son knows some people that work there in California, but I haven't really been able to wrap my arm around the whole concept.
I understand it, but I guess I'm not very good at maneuvering it -- I don't do well learning new things!!
!One of the aspects is that you can have friends and you have to invite them to be your friend or vice versa.
I don't have many friends on Facebook!
I feel like the kid who never got picked in gym class!
Now granted, people my age don't usually use facebook so they wouldn't be on the system to be my friend.
I've asked a few people to be my friend and they haven't responded.
And some people, I want to ask to be my friends, but I'm afraid they will say no!!!
How is that for rejection -- by cyberspace!
I'm still working on it.
I am surrprised though by some that are on facebook and I would have never thought they would understand how to even log on -- at least I can do that.
I'm going to keep working on it.
My facebook profile is at http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=501222249We are off to Nashville tomorrow to go to the SEC tournament for women's basketball.
My husband is going and that helps me a lot.
Of course, I have my earplugs handy to handle the crowd noise!Next week I'm off to Albany Georgia for an Alzheimer's speaking engagement.
I'm looking forward to it -- I spoke to this group several years ago and they were a great audience and a large one at that.
I think back about how my speaking engagements have changed over the years with my message.
It's amazing all the I have learned and can hopefully share with others.
My friend Carol is going with me to be my traveling companion and I'm looking forward to spending time with her.I had one crown put on last week and it looks likes that might be it and I won't have to have the other one.
That's good for me as well as my wallet.

The photo above is of a daffodil that starting growing this week.
It was 70 degrees at the beginning of the week and then by the end of the week we had snow flurries and high wind.
The daffodil got "blown over" by the wind and didn't last long.
I think a squirrel must have transplanted this daffodil last year because it certainly wasn't planted there.
It seemed awful lonely there.
I went to the dentist -- not good news.
Two crowns are needed right next to each other!
Two cracked teeth.
I knew it wasn't good but I didn't know it was that bad.
I'm sure our dentist doesn't have a coupon floating around for Buy One Get One Free -- but I should get a discount.
He can't do both at the same time either.
I go for one today.
The state association of the Alzheimer's Assn.
has a new director.
She will start in April.
And, the national office has just hired someone to head up The Early Stage initiative.
That's progress and I'm glad to hear it.
We are getting some preliminary reports back on our work study issue that I wrote about a month or so ago.
It is kind of staggering to see the ages of when people were diagnosed and what they have had to go through in the workplace.
Results are still being tabulated but it should prove to be quite an eye opener.

OK -- so I said my week was going to be slow but my weekend made up for it.
And, I have had two days without a nap so I'm not doing real well tonight.
Saturday I had a Memory Walk mini retreat/meeting in Atlanta with people from six other walks around metro Atlanta.
It was a good meeting but long.
They we went to meet Alan's fiancee's parents for dinner.
That was delightful.
They are such nice people -- we really enjoy being with them and I'm sorry we don't do it more often.
It's nice to compare notes about our children -- most of the time anyway!Today was a women's basketball game at UGA.
We played good ball today and beat a good Auburn team by about 15 points.
Several weeks ago they beat us by 30 points so we did a great job today.
We need to with the SEC tournament coming up in just a few weeks.My teeth hurt.
I've mentioned this before and I went to the dentist and he told me a lot of my problem stemmed from grinding my teeth.
But there has also been this one tooth that we have "been watching" for some time that he has told me that will need a crown and possibly a root canal -- well it is time -- as much as I hate to admit it.
My wallet doesn't like it either but something has to be done or I won't be eating much for a long time -- which might not be a bad idea.
Hopefully, I can get in tomorrow and he we can have something happen soon.On a funny note (or not so funny note depending on how you look at it) -- I have to look at it as funny or I would totally lose my mind.
When I was getting ready to go to the basketball game this afternoon I was brushing my teeth with my battery operated toothbrush.
My husband had gone to play tennis and I was riding to the game with friends.
Anyway, after brushing my teeth I couldn't remember how to turn the toothbrush off.
I thought about it for awhile and knew that I couldn't put it on the counter top because it would vibrate and fall to the ground.
So, I decided that I would just put it in the sink and several things could happen -- 1 -- the batteries would just wear out, 2 -- my husband would come home and shut it off -- or 3 I would remember before I went to the game what I was suppose to do.
In the end, a few minutes before my ride, I remembered -- thus not having to get questioned by my husband as to why I would leave the toothbrush running in the sink.
What fun I have sometimes!I'm going to bed early tonight!

LB -- your comments are great -- don't worry about my time!
In answer to your question, I cannot explain to someone when this is happening to me.
Like for example, when I find that I can't make dinner -- at the time I can't tell my husband why I can't -- I just tell him I can't do it and he does it.
Sometimes when reading the paper and I can't understand it I might ask for help but even after it is explained to me I still don't understand it.
It may different with other people -- I usually liken it to an "out of body" experience -- like I know what is happening but I can't do anything about it.
Just being there as a silent partner as you mentioned is comforting -- it is to me anyway.
I know someone is around and if I can't do these things someone will do them and I don't worry about it.
I hope this helps.
This disease is so much harder on the caretaker and I always feel guilty about that.
It's hard for us to explain what is going on and you're suppose to know -- it isn't always that easy is it!!!
Thanks for your comments.

Last week was a long one.
I had something going just about everyday and it certainly took its toll on me.
This week I have nothing on the calendar.
I need to be better about scheduling myself for things.
I think I can do it and then I get so exhausted I can't keep up.
Plus, my writing skills have been so bad lately that it takes me forever to post here.
I have gone back and read some posts and some emails I sent and I know everyone must think that I didn't graduate from elementary school.
I just can't see the errors when I am doing this or proofing.
Most of my problems come from the words that sound alike but have different meanings -- and I can't think of the word for that right now -- but like reed and read.
It's so frustrating.
I'm trying to work on some of my homemade cards.
That seems to relax me and I am selling them for money for the Memory Walk this year.
I enjoy doing it and although sometimes it takes me a while to get to the finished product, I feel a sense of accomplishment.More soon.

On Saturday, April 5th there will be a Town Hall Meeting for those with early memory loss, mild cognitive impairment and early stage Alzheimer's.
The event is free and open to the public.
It will start around 11 and end at 1:00 p.m.
Lunch will be provided.
The event will take place at the Peachtree Road United Methodist Church in Buckhead.If you have been following my blog you will know that the Town Hall meeting concept is something that is being done all across the country.
It was intiated by the National Alzheimer's Association.
The purpose of the Town Hall meeting format is for those with early memory problems to be able to share the struggles they encounter and to meet others that also suffer from the same thing.
Caregivers are invited to attend but the forum will only be open to those suffering from early memory loss, mild cognitive impairment or early stage Alzheimer's.
More information and a sign up will be posted to the website for the state chapter soon.
I will also post a link when it is available.

I can't believe it is almost the middle of February.
February has always been birthday month for my family.
My father and both of my brothers all have (had) February birthdays.
My husband shares a birthday with one of my brothers (tomorrow, the 11th) and one of my best friends also celebrates her birthday tomorrow.
Later in the month another friend shares his birthday with my other brother.
I'm always amazed at how many people I know share birthdays.
My husband will be 64 tomorrow.
I'm only 52.
And, yes, the age difference becomes much greater when you get older.
But, when we got married almost 30 years ago, you couldn't have told me that!The next few months are busy ones.
I have a few Alzheimer's meetings and I am going to be a keynote speaker at a meeting in March in Albany.
I've thought a lot about that particular speech and can't decide on the direction to go with it.
I've learned so much since I started speaking out about Alzheimer's, that I am never quite sure what people want to hear.
I'm sure I will change the presentation several times before I realize what I really need to say.April 5th the Georgia Chapter is going to have an Early Stage Town Hall Meeting.
I've mentioned these before in this blog and I would encourage you that if you are in the Atlanta area and have early memory loss, this is the place you want to be.
There have been many Town Hall Meetings across the country and it is a great forum for those of us with early stage, early memory loss to get together and share ideas -- and to share ways of coping with it.
There will be more information about it soon and I will post a link to it when it is up on the Georgia site.
My women's basketball team (UGA Women) are not doing too well as of late.
We lost a close one to LSU today.
We play again on Thursday night at home and can hopefully pull out a "W".
The SEC tournament is in Nashville at the beginning of the month.
We need to win a few more before getting into tournament action.My husband and I are looking forward to meeting Jennifer's (my son's fiancee) parents for dinner in a few weeks.
It's a shame we don't get together more often since they are just in Atlanta.
I'm sure our respective children shudder when they think of us getting together -- especially since the wedding is just a little over six months away.
Our Memory Walk meetings start up this week.
The walk isn't until November, but the whole planning thing needs to happen soon.
The committee that works on our walk here in Athens is great -- they let me sit in whenever I want to.
I really don't have anything to do per se, but I do kind of keep up with what is happening.
The group is really committed to the cause.
This year's walk is going to be November 8th.There are many more things I was going to post today, but I will save them for another day.
It's taken me a long time to write this so I'll try to post again soon.

I'm having one of those days -- panic attack days!
I am real anxious today and there is no reason for it.
I just get like that some time and there is nothing to do but wait it out.
I feel more comfortable at home when I have these days and luckily I don't have anything planned until later this evening.
And, my husband will be with me so it will be o.k.
I have a lot I want to write in here but can't seem to put my thoughts into order today.
Some call these "foggy" days -- and I guess that is the best way to describe it.
More soon when the cloud lifts!

A young man in our community just lost his life in Iraq.
It was his second tour of duty.
His older sister went to school with my son and his mom and I were friends through PTA and other various school activities.
His funeral is tomorrow.
My husband and I are going.
It will be very hard.
I get much more emotional these days -- but losing a life so young is always hard.

I've been tired this weekend and had a hard time collecting my thoughts.
I guess with my SS hearing over with and a quick trip to Florida for a few days wore me out more than I thought.
I have a few meetings in Atlanta this week and then things get a little quiet.As part of the Early Stage Advisory Group, I have been working on a project with several other people regarding issues that those with early stage alzheimer's have in regards to work, getting insurance, benefits, etc.
If you are in the early stage category or a care partner of an early stage person, are reading this blog and could spare a few minutes to fill out a survey, please go tohttp://alz.earlystage.sgizmo.comWe are trying to get data to not only help the association to deal with these issues, but for many that are struggling with these issues to have some data to take to some agencies that might be able to help us in the future.
We all have our stories and if you are willing to share with us we would appreciate it.

After three years and three months I was finally granted Social Security Disability benefits today.
I went for my hearing before an administrative law judge.
Minutes before the hearing was to begin the judge came out and told us there would be no hearing, that full benefits were going to be provided based on my medical records.
My attorney and I sat with the judge for a few minutes, his decision was recorded and we were on our way.
I could say lots right now about the Social Security system, but I'm not.
I have said quite a bit already.
I'm just glad it is over.
It's just too bad it had to take this long.

I haven't written lately because I've had a hard time putting into words what I am feeling.
I'm very anxious and tired.
There are a lot of things on my mind that I can't get resolved and that is frustrating to me.
Things just seem to be fuzzy for me.
I'm not sleeping at night and that doesn't help.My hearing for social security finally comes tomorrow.
Maybe after that I will be feeling better.More soon when I'm feeling better.

The last two nights CBS has been running an investigative report on Social Security Disability and how hard it is to get it.
It was a two part segment and the links to the printed versions are below this post.
I learned a lot from these pieces and coincidentally, my case is being heard next week.
It has been almost three years of waiting for me.
My husband and I met with the attorney that my insurance company hired to help me through the process.
I learned even more interesting things from him yesterday.My claim meets all the criteria for benefits.
And, this claim has met every criteria from the day it was submitted.
But, it was denied.
The attorney went through some of the "checklists" the SS administration uses to grant or deny benefits.
In certain areas the person looking at the claim had checked off certain things that were impossible for me to do.
If you had so many of these things checked off you were eligible for benefits.
I met the criteria.
Two years ago Social Security sent me for some neuro psychological testing.
I already had some testing done during my diagnosis process but Social security sent me again.
The tests were even more difficult the second time around.
But, Social security sent me a letter and said basically that the tests showed that I was capable of holding down a full time job.
I asked SS for a copy of the results from the test and I was never given a copy.
Yesterday, my attorney told me that the second test I took was no better than the first and even worse.
It basically said that I was unable to perform at a certain level and that I had limited functionality.
But, SS said otherwise after reading the report.The piece on CBS said that 2/3 of the people that get denied for Social Security disability the first time, never re apply -- thus saving the government lots of money.
I was denied three times, and I will finally get my day in front of a judge next week.If you are fighting this battle, don't give up.
Talk to your legislators, talk to whoever will listen.
A new administration may be coming to town and now is the time to speak up.http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/01/14/cbsnews_investigates/main3712627.shtmlhttp://www.cbsnews.com/sections/eveningnews/main3420.shtml

Last night on The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer, there saw about a 12 minute segment on Early Stage Alzheimer's Disease.
I'm proud to say that five of my colleagues from the Early Stage Advisory Group that I serve on from the National Office of the Alzheimer's Assn.
were featured.
Two of them, Rich and Jay, held an early memory loss forum last year in LA and this piece was done at that time.
Please take a minute to watch it -- they did a great job and you can see what type of people they are.
Here is a link http://www.pbs.org/newshour/video/module.html?mod=0&pkg=10012008&seg=4If you like what you saw and can take a few minutes to send PBS an email, please do.
Thank them for their support and their time for running this segment.

Dee from Canada asked about my last comment regarding talking on the telephone.
I know that many others with AD have this problem as well.
Talking on the phone is difficult for me because it is hard for me to follow the conversation.
I have to concentrate for too long and I can't seem to do that.
I definitely prefer email because I can go back and re-read it if I need to.
It sounds kind of silly that it is hard to talk on the phone, but it is just so hard to keep focused and to follow the theme of the conversation.
Plus, when talking on the phone the conversation keeps jumping around and I have a hard time jumping from one subject to the next.
My friends understand this so that is good.One thing about our Early Stage Advisory Group is that once a month we have a teleconference call.
It lasts between 1 1/2 hours to 2 hours.
Needless to say, after a little while I have a hard time keeping up as I am sure many others on the call do too, but don't admit it!
But, it is the only way for us to all communicate at the same time since we are spread all over the country.
We do communicate through a secure message board when we need to and we do email, but the phone conversations are the best way for all of us to get together.We have a busy year ahead.
It kind of makes my mind spin just thinking about things.
Three weddings for one thing -- one of which is my son's!
If I can make it through the summer I'll be o.k.
I worry alot about how my health is going to be in 6 months or 9 months and I don't know why I worry because there is not one thing I can do about it.
Don't they say you shouldn't worry about things out of your control?
I guess it is because there are so many things going on this year that I wonder how I'll be feeling when it is time for those events.Numbers -- 186 Christmas cards received 120 days until my son graduates from Stanford Law School 6 days in May when my husband and I will be home together 22 days spent in hotel rooms in May 7 pounds I gained over the holidays (not a good thing) 1 hour spent writing this blog -- did I mention how bad I am getting at this?

A comment left by Jim on the post below brings up the question about an experimental drug discussed in the Still Alice book I mentioned.
To answer your question, Jim, I'm not positive about which drug in particular Lisa was talking about in her book, but about the time the book was being published, a drug was very close to being brought to market called Alzhamed.
However, the clinical trials did not come out as good as the pharmaceutical company was hoping for and the drug was not marketed afterall.
The only drugs I know of at the moment are Aricept, Exelon, Razadyne and Namenda.
Namenda is usually taken in conjunction with one of the other three drugs.
I belieive this is correct, but if someone else is reading this I'm sure they will correct me if I am wrong.
Many of us had our hopes up for the Alzhamed drug -- but there are several other drugs still in the pipeline in clinical trials.
Perhaps if Lisa looks at the blog she may also be able to address this issue.
And, I do agree with you that Still Alice is sad.....but so is this disease.
Thanks for your comments.Another event that I wanted to mention is another event happening here in Georgia.
It is being hosted by the Georgia Chapter of the Alzheimer's Association.
The speakers are great --I've heard many of them, so if you can spare a day on January 23rd, you might want to check it out.

I have tried to sit down and write something all week but every time I do I have so many thoughts that I can't sift through them all.
So, I get up from the computer desk and don't post anything.
But this morning, I decided to post even if some of the things I am writing don't seem to make sense.
I just need to get them written down.1.
My son came home this week.
It is so nice to have him home.
We laugh a lot when he is here and I miss that.
It's a little harder for me to concentrate when he is around because that is one more person in the house that I am not used to having around, but I'll take it anyday if I can be with him.2.
I have been amazed at some of the cards, notes and gifts that have been appearing on our doorstep.
I love getting cards at Christmas and yes, I am one of those people that love getting the Christmas letters from everyone.
I forget what is happening in their lives during the year and it is always so nice to catch up with what they have going on.
This year, when I sent out my Christmas letter, I decided to spare some people from reading it, so I didn't enclose a letter in many cards because I just figured that they might not care what is going on in our household.
How wrong I was -- I have gotten several cards and notes from people saying,  "we missed your letter this year and what is happening in your life".
That kind of shocked me but I should be pleased that friends are interested in us.
I suppose many thought perhaps my illness prevented me from writing something this year.
And, it was definitely hard for me to come up with something but I did.
I will follow up with these friends later.
And, thoughtful gifts, from people I never expected to get something from have arrived, with basically, a thinking of you message.
Friends are so important and I love everyone of mine!3.
My on going struggle with Social Security is back in the picture.
The social security office is now ready to work my case.
I got a letter from them and my attorney asking for all this information "immediately".
Of course, getting it over the Christmas holiday and trying to track down the records "immediately" might prove to be a little difficult.
And, I certainly would have appreciated them looking at my files "immediately" instead of almost 30 months after they were submitted!4.
I've got to try to get into the dentist today.
There is definitely something wrong with my teeth -- it is very weird -- I can't pinpoint the problem but I feel like all of my teeth hurt.
I know that sounds funny, but that is the only way to describe it.
I'm not sure if he can help me, but I'm hoping maybe he can give me something for the pain to get me through Christmas.5.
Going back to the cards -- one thing that certainly humbled me, was that an agent I used to work with when I booked performances sent me a card.
She left the business several years ago when she had a baby.
But, on the back of the envelope of her card, she put a note saying that I had inspired her and to read her Christmas letter - she hoped I didn't mind.
After opening the envelope and reading her first paragraph, I was touched.
She told her friends that she wasn't going to write a Christmas letter this year, but after reading mine and realizing how important mine was to her, that she decided to write one.
We became friends even in our crazy business days that I truly admire her.
6.
Tomorrow, I am going to meet my two "surrogate sons" as I have called them in previous blogs.
These two young men worked for me and I went to one of their weddings this year.
I had posted a photo of them on my site last summer.
One is in the army in Texas and another works in Pennsylvania.
They will both be home for Christmas and we are getting together for lunch.
They are about a year older than my son and I have really enjoyed getting to know them not only as employees but as individuals.
We have shared many a laugh together.
The other one is getting married this year, and unfortunately he is getting married the same day that my nephew is gettng married in Illinois so I won't be able to get to his wedding.
The Army is sending one to Iraq come July.
It will probably be a long time before the three of us are together again since I won't be at the wedding.
Just like my son, I hate that they are not close by.
I enjoy being around them and I am grateful they have kept me in their life.OK -- Ineed to stop now.
I realize much of what I have written probably doesn't mean much to most people but it does to me.
But thanks for reading.
If I don't get a chance to post again before Christmas --- my very best to everyone for a safe and happy holiday!

This week I was in Atlanta.
I went to speak to some donors of the Alzheimer's Association.
While there, my husband and I stopped at one of the malls since it was the middle of the week and not as crowded as usual.
The decorations were up, but it was 75 degrees outside.
It just didn't feel like Christmas.
Not that we usually have snow or anything here in the south for Christmas, but it usually isn't 75 degrees either.
A cold front is suppose to move in tomorrow.
That will help.I have a conference call this week for our Early Stage Advisory Group and my son will be home on Tuesday.
It's time for him to be home for awhile.
That will make it seem more like Christmas.

I'm here -- I've just had to slow down a little.
I have managed to wind up with pneumonia so I've been resting.
The doctor gave me some antibiotics and some cough medicine which I think have helped.
I've certainly been sleeping a lot.
I'm trying to push myself a little to do a few things, but I get tired very quickly.
I was due for some down time, but I'm not sure this is what I thought it would be!

has a great program called "The Infinite Mind".
A friend that is on our Early Stage Advocacy Group is interviewed as well as Peter Reed from the National Alzheimer's Association.
The program is an hour long, but worth listening to if you have the time.
James is a great person.
He and I have spoken a couple of times together at conferences.
He was in charge of the IT program for American Express when he was diagnosed with Early Stage Alzheimer's.
James has two daughters that go to Northwestern University.
He has a great sense of humor, and although we consider him a "techie", he is very outgoing and a great speaker.
I love his analogies when he speaks and I think -- why couldn't I have thought of that!Here is a link to the program http://lcmedia.com/mindprgm.htm

My trip to South Carolina for the Town Hall meeting was good.
I got to meet some new people but, as always there is never enough time to talk to everyone.
There were about 100 people at the Town Hall meeting.
One of the speakers, was a lady from South Carolina who has early stage Alzheimer's.
I enjoyed laughing with her as she talked about her ways of coping.
One thing she said she did as soon as she was diagnosed was to go and put names on the back of all of her photographs so everyone would know who they were.
I did that exact same thing!
That is what led me into doing scrapbooking.
We are all so different in how the Alzheimer's affects us but it seems like we respond in so many like ways.Before I left on Saturday I was writing some notes to people, and I just couldn't spell.
Every five minutes I was asking my husband how to spell things -- and I am a good speller.
I haven't figured out how to use the spell check in the blog program and since I have such a problem with synonyms (sp?)
it wouldn't tell me if I was using the right word.
How frustrating this is to me.
It's getting much worse.
I have to write and re-write just to make sense of what I am trying to say.
And, if you are reading this I am sure at times you become just as confused as I do.
I've also noticed that it is getting more difficult to type correctly.
I've always been a very fast typist and I realize I make a lot more mistakes now.
It's so frustrating I tend to scream about it at times!I've managed to catch a pretty good cold.
I've been sleeping most of the day.
A few more days of rest is what I need.More soon -- thanks for reading!

This week has been a long one.
There is so much to write that I have been putting it off.
But I decided that this weekend's adventure to South Carolina for the Alzheimer's Town Hall meeting would be a separate entry so I thought I should go ahead and fill in the rest of this week.Several weeks ago when I was going to Chicago to speak, I took the airport shuttle from Athens to Atlanta.
There were 10 women in this shuttle (poor driver) and of course you can imagine there was a lot of talking!
Someone asked me what I was going to Chicago for and I said a meeting.
Then she asked me what kind of meeting.
I told her.
Then she asked me why I was going to the meeting.
I told her I was speaking.
She asked me what I was speaking about and I told her.
As always, that opens up a new conversation.
And, as always, most everyone knows or has someone in their family with Alzheimer's.
The lady asking me all the questions had a mother with the disease and the lady sitting next to me had a brother (age 64) with Alzheimer's.
He was in an assisted living home.
Obviously, the topic revolved around Alzheimer's for the rest of the ride.
I kept noticing that a lady in front of us kept turning her head to listen in on the conversation.
Eventually, she turned around and joined us.
Turns out she is with the Gerentology Dept.
at the University of Georgia.
She had participated in our Athens Memory Walk.
She also asked me if I would come and speak to her class.
This past Monday night, I went to Dr. Glass' class and spoke.
What a great experience it was.
The head of the department, Dr. Poon, spoke before me and talked of his research with Centenarians.
It was very fascinating.
The class was a graduate level class and the students varied greatly in what fields they were heading into.
I enjoyed speaking with them and I am hoping that I will continue to be in contact with them and they can possibly help in some future fund raising opportunities for Memory Walk.
I really appreciated the opportunity to visit with them and to get to spend some time with Dr. Poon.
We talked a little about the "cognitive reserve" that I have mentioned in my blog several times.
He thought it would be useful to keep track every day of where "my tank" was on reserve and to highlight the reasoning behind it.
I think it is a good idea, I just haven't gotten around to start logging it yet!Going back to Chicago, a very similar thing happened to me as I was sharing a cab to the hotel with a lady from Boston.
She asked me a lot of the same questions the lady in the van asked me and eventually asked me to come to Boston to speak to a group of people.
She evidently works in the field of health care with an emphasis on aging.
She thought it would be interesting to get some of her staff and associates together to hear what I had to say.
Interesting how these things come about.Earlier this week I went to Atlanta to visit with the Alzheimer's Assn.
Chapter President, Jan Bequeath.
After eleven years with the Association she is stepping down at the end of this month.
Jan has been someone I have admired both as a friend and a leader.
Her staff has always been there for me and she will be sorely missed.
I wish her well.
That same night I attended the "Better Start Living" concert -- it was a benefit concert for the Alzheimer's Association at a new venue in Atlanta.
Song writer Monte Powell started organizing this about a year ago.
Monte is a prolific writer and has many many No.
1 songs for country artists across the board.
His family has been affected by Alzheimer's and he wanted to do something to help raise money.
One of the performers he writes for is Keith Urban, so he invited Keith Urban to town for an acoustical show!
It seemed to be a success and I hope a lot of money was raised.
There will be other "Better Start Living" concerts to come -- possibly to a town near you!All of my cognitive reserve was completed by yesterday.
I got home from Atlanta and I think I slept the rest of the day!
I was pretty out of it.
I'll rest some more this morning and then this afternoon I'm off to Spartanburg SC for the Town Hall meeting Saturday morning.
Someone from the Chapter office is driving me over there so I shouldn't have to call on "that reserve" until this evening when I meet with the staff from Chicago and Washington DC for dinner.
I'm excited about the Town Hall meeting tomorrow.
I hope the turnout will be good.More when I return.

I hope everyone had a good Thanksgiving.
We had a very quiet one -- just Ralph and I.
But it was a good day.
I got lots of things done around the house I have been putting off and finished up my Christmas cards.
Since I make my own cards it always takes awhile, and then, I can never decide who gets what card since they are all different.
But, I consider it my therapy and I enjoy doing it.
Speaking of cards, my son sent us the lovliest Thanksgiving card.
I won't share what he said, but it brought tears to my eyes (awwwww) -- sometimes he surprises me.
I have a busy week.
I'm speaking to a class at UGA on Monday night, going to Atlanta on Wednesday and Thursday for some Alzheimer's business and then to SC on Alzheimer's business on Friday and Saturday.
Wednesday night, legendary country artist Keith Urban is doing a benefit concert in Atlanta for the Alzheimer's Assn.
It is headed up by award winning songwriter Monte Powell.
Monte has written many songs for Keith Urban as well as other country stars.
Monte Powell has Alzheimer's in his family and asked Keith to help him with this fundraiser.
I hope it does well.
If you are in the Atlanta area and want to come, check out the Alzheimer's Assn.
website at www.alz.org/georgia.
On Saturday morning in Spartanburg SC there is a Town Hall meeting put on by the National Alzheimer's Association.
The meeting is for people suffering with early stage Alzheimer's.
The event is free, you just need to register.
If you are in that area and would like to attend go to the national website at www.alz.org and follow the prompts to the Town Hall meeting site.
Even if you have not been diagnosed or think you might have early stage, I would encourage you to attend.
You will learn a lot and realize you are not alone.
More upon my return.

My trip to Chicago was a good one, albeit short.
I  don't think I was there for a whole 24 hours.
It was cold and windy -- but -- it is Chicago!
I wish I had taken my camera because much of the city of decorated for Christmas.
I thought it was a little early, but I guess with Thanksgiving being this early that's why.
Since I was by myself I didn't venture out too much because I was afraid I would get lost.
Even though I know Chicago pretty well, I felt a little uncomfortable out roaming around.
And, that isn't what I was there for anyway.
I did get some rest the night I got in which was good because if I hadn't I don't think things would have gone so well the next day.The speech on Friday morning went pretty well.
The Association videotaped for use elsewhere.It's Thanksgiving week and hopefully more quiet.
I need a little downtime.More soon -- I promise

I have an Alzheimer's function to speak at on Friday morning so I am off to Chicago in the morning.
It is suppose to be 41 degrees with 23 mph winds.
That is a little chillier than Athens this time of year!
Had another meeting in Atlanta this week.
As I said in my last post, I'm tired.
Next week there isn't too much going on for Thanksgiving so I'm looking forward to resting and getting caught up on some things around the house.
More when I return from Chicago.

I had a bad day yesterday.
I have been out of my routine for several days and I am tired.
I was anxious the whole day -- fighting off panic attacks.
I have lots of undone projects and feeling stressed to finish them when I have plenty of time.
My words weren't coming out right and I had a very hard time concentrating.
I need to slow down a little and get some rest.

<doc date=Saturday, November 10, 2007>
I'm off to a UGA football game today.
A friend of mine in Atlanta has an extra ticket and he asked me to be his date.
We play Auburn and it should be a good game.
I sometimes have a hard time with the noise and all that is going on but with good friends, they help me a long.Thanksgiving is so early this year.
It will be here in just a few weeks.
I was thinking that this year I need to do a better job of letting all of my friends know how thankful I am for them.
They have all shared in my journey and I can't thank them enough for being there when I needed someone.
It's never too late to say thank you.My son is partying in New Orleans this weekend.
A bunch of his friends from the Georgia Young Democrats or some such group he belonged to in Atlanta was getting together down there and he decided to go.
It must be nice to be young and do stuff like that.Another friend of mine has decided to take the plunge and get married this summer.
He is a young man that used to work for me.
He's about a year older than Alan so I think I was able to relate to him pretty well when he worked for me.
That makes at least four weddings this summer -- something to look forward to.
As well as Alan's graduation.
We received a preliminary outline of what is happening at Stanford on graduation weekend already and we need to start making our plans.
Things seem to be happening so quickly!
But, Alan's graduation date has been circled on our calendar for three years -- and I know that he will be ready to graduate -- he must be getting tired of school by now!Need to get ready to go to the gym.
Some unwanted pounds have started to creep up and I need to do a little more at the gym before the holidays get into full swing.
Seems like there is always something to worry about.

<doc date=Sunday, November 04, 2007>
Sometimes I feel overwhelmed.
It used to take a lot to make me feel that way but not anymore.
There are lots of loose ends on some projects I am working on and that is always unsettling to me.
And, the loose ends are because I am having to wait on others to tie them up.
I hate that -- I'd rather do it myself and know that it is done.
I'm not a procrastinator and those that are drive me crazy.
I also don't like people who are late -- but that is a whole different blog subject!Anyway, this week we have our wrap up meeting for the Memory Walk.
We are still taking in money but I'm not sure we are going to make our $75,000 mark.
We'll see.
I also have to go to Atlanta for another Alzheimer's meeting.
I'm working on a speech for a meeting in Chicago the week after that.
I'm also starting work on another project with some colleagues from the Early Stage Advocacy Group.
It will be some work but something to look forward to.
I only hope that I can contribute as much as everyone else does.
I feel inferior sometimes when working with this group as they are all so accomplished, driven and intelligent.
My husband keeps telling me that I fit into that category but I don't think I do.
Perhaps I don't feel as focused because I have been fighting this disease for five years.
I'm not sure what the reason is but I know that a lot of work still has to be done and I'm willing to do my part as best I can.
</doc>
<doc date=Thursday, November 01, 2007>
I know I haven't posted in awhile.
I've been kind of lazy and tired.
I finally got caught up from the Memory Walk and then I was off to Atlanta for a couple of days.
I'm also working on a couple of projects for the National Alzheimer's office so that is keeping me busy.
My friends from the Early Onset Advocacy Group, held their Early Memory Loss Forum last weekend in LA and from all accounts it was a huge success.
You can read about it here - www.alzforum.org/new/detail.asp?id=1675   Hopefully, other chapters will pick up the ball and continue running with it.
It has turned cool here in the south finally.
The leaves are starting to turn but with the drought we have had this year they are not so colorful.
We are going to play golf today and I'm not sure how many balls we will lose in the leaves!The UGA women's basketball season opens up tonight with an exhibition game.
As you know from following this blog I'm a big fan.
Our team is ranked #10 in the pre-season polls.
We have lots of players this year -- it seems like we are always low in numbers because of injuries, but hopefully we will remain healthy this year.
I do have my problems going to games though.
Some days I can't go because of the noise.
It is way too distracting to me.
Sometimes we have to come home early because I can't deal with it all.
I try -- I really do but it many times just too overwhelming.
A friend of mine who recently retired has talked to me about going to some away games with her and the prospect of it sounds great -- I am just not sure how many of those games I can do.
However, the crowds at the arenas around the league are not as large as our crowds (except a couple which we wouldn't be going to anyway) so it might not be so bad.
My friends are getting used to traveling with me so that is good!Next week I'm off to an Alzheimer's meeting in Atlanta and then off to Chicago for a few days the week after that on Alzheimer's business.
I will try to enter a little more frequently.

I must be more tired than I thought today because it has taken me forever to figure out how to log into this blog to post.
But, now that I am here.....The fourth and fifth part of my friend Rich's interview can now be found on Alzforum at this linkhttp://www.alzforum.org/eFAD/profiles/bozanich1.asp#bozanich4I've taken this out of the fourth installment because this hit so close to home for me.Alzforum: People with high IQ tend to be more difficult to diagnose because they compensate so well.RB: Yes, the "cognitive reserve" again.
I take that to mean that people who had a high degree of intelligence, or high degree of functioning, have to lose more for it to either bother them, or become noticeable to the point where someone thinks, "Okay, something is clearly wrong with Joe."
I remember when I got my diagnosis, a good friend said, "Well, you were always too smart anyway.
Now you'll be just like the rest of us.
"That was meant as a compliment, but it's not very comforting.
My friend W. and I often talk about how people will say to us, "Oh, you don't have it."
He also had a very high-functioning career.
So although he notices his deficits and that he is not functioning the way he once did, others don't see it much, because he is not what people have in their mind as the stereotype of a person with dementia.To get back to my diagnosis, seeing the results of my neuropsych exam was heartbreaking.
My reading comprehension was grade-school level.
She had to keep giving me simpler and simpler passages to read.
I think I read a seventh-grade passage and got every question wrong.
And what did I do for a living?
I was an editor.
Do you think someone would ever allow me to work in publishing again if I couldn't read a simple passage and retain its meaning?
Thankfully, no one is testing me after it takes me 10 times to read an article in the newspaper before some small part of it sinks in.
"Rich says things so eloquently.
I remember reading my neuropsych evaluation and my heart sank.
Not only was this the first time that I saw the words "probably Alzheimer's disease" but it showed my IQ as being very very low.
I knew I had a relatively high IQ at one point and I felt stupid.
I know I'm not stupid, but I've said many times that this disease makes you feel stupid, because once simple tasks are so hard to do.
I have to constantly remind myself that I am not stupid -- the disease is making me do stupid things.Thanks again Rich for your interview.
I know it was a long process but you said everything so well.
Best of luck on your conference this weekend.

The piece on Spencer Johansen was great on NBC Nightly news.
I hope you got a chance to watch it.
If not, please check it out on their website at http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3032619There is a little more on the website.I think they did a good job and Spencer did a great job.
Hopefully we will see more of this type of coverage in the weeks and months to come.As always, I'm asking you to send feeback to NBC nightly news thanking them for their coverage.
Emails can be sent to nightly@nbc.com.

of Rich's interview is now on Alzforum.
Here is the link http://www.alzforum.org/I have heard from many of you that you have enjoyed reading about Rich and his "adventures" -- my word, not his!
I really like the part about reading the headline in the paper and not being able to undertand it.
This happens to me all the time.
I hate it!
And, then having to re-read the articles to have them make sense.
I don't do movies anymore either -- too hard to follow.I really appreciate Rich putting into words what some of us cannot.

<doc date=Sunday, October 21, 2007>
on Monday night (Oct. 22) is suppose to have a feature on one of the members of our Early Stage Advisory Group -- his name is Spencer Johansen.
He is still working as a police chief in the small town of Lexington Illinois.
Not far from my home town in Illinois.
When Spencer announced he had the early stages of Alzheimer's and announced it to his community they were very supportive.
The media has taken a look at this and wants to discuss the fact that he has alzheimer's and carries a gun.
We'll see how the news piece handles this.Please watch if you can.

The Memory Walk was today.
It was a great day -- lots of people and the weather was beautiful.
We had over 450 walkers registered before the day started, $45,000 raised before the day started and 39 teams.
I don't know where we ended up money wise but we'll know soon enough.
The goal for our walk was $75,000 and I think we will make that.
It was a great event.
Having said that -- I'm glad it is over.When I came home I told my husband my body and my brain were so tired I didn't know what to do.
I rested, took a good nap, and rested some more.
It will take my brain a few days to recover.
I bring this up, because there has been much discussion lately about "cognitive reserve".
I never really knew it had a name, but I figured that someone would come up with it.
It is where you can store up all this brain power for something and then it is shot and gone for several days.
I am putting a link in here that I hope you will all read if you are caring for someone with Alzheimer's -- or have it yourself.
Rich Bozanich is a friend from California that serves on the Early Stage Advisroy Group with me.
Rich is a journalist and can put into words so eloquently what I can't.
The Alzforum  http://www.alzforum.org/  has an interview with Rich that to me is amazing.
The interview is going to be in five parts with the first two posted at this link.
Rich and another college Jay Smith have worked tirelessly for the last 15 months to put together an early memory loss forum in Los Angeles.
It is next week and it is sold out with 350 people signed up.
They've done a great job in putting this together and I know that they will be totally exhausted when it is over.
Many people will be better off having attended this seminar I know.
I wish I could be there with them, but they know I am there in spirit.
Please take a few minutes to read Rich's interview.
It is very enlightening.
I hate it that my words don't come out like Rich's -- but at least someone can do it!
I especially like Rich's comments in the second part of the interview when people are trying to make themselves feel better by trying to make you feel better.
I kind of had to laugh out loud because we have all been there.
Thanks Rich!Hopefully I can get my brain wrapped around a few more thoughts and write some more about the walk soon.
My team did a great job -- they raised almost $15,000 and we still have money coming in -- so we might make it yet.

You might have read an article about a new blood test designed to detect Alzheimer's much earlier than can now be done.
It is going through testing and is expected to be on the market by 2009 and if everything goes well.
One member of our National Advisory group was on CBS news last night in relation to a story about this new test.
He did a great job!The national office called me yesterday to see if I could do an interview with ABC news, but I had to make my way to the ABC affiliation in Atlanta in exactly three hours from the phone call.
At the time of the day they called me if would have taken me too long to get ready and to get to Atlanta during rush hour traffic to make it, so someone else was called to do it.
The networks sometimes don't give the national office a lot of time to react.
Luckily, there are many on our advisory group that live closer to a large city where this can happen.Here is a link to another story popular yesterday -- this discusses several different things in the pipeline to help us.

It's been a busy week.
I think I have one more busy week this week and then I can coast for awhile.Thanks to all who called me this week or sent emails.
I appreciate your thoughtfulness and remembering me.
I haven't gotten around to returning a lot of the emails but I will!I've been eating way too much lately and have to get back on the wagon.
When it gets a little cooler I turn to comfort foods and those are not always as healthy as they should be.
Many of you have been asking if Alan and Jennifer have set a wedding date yet.
There's no long answer -- the short of it is no.
I'll be sure to let you know when they do.
Have lots of meetings and planning for the walk yet to do this week.
Saturday is our big day.
My team -- Team Athens has raised over $10,000 now and I think that we'll top out over $12,500 -- or at least that is what I am hoping for.
We are suppose to get some much needed rain later in the week -- and if it rains on Saturday that will be o.k.
-- because we need the rain so much.

The weather has finally turned a little cooler and hopefully it will stay that way for awhile!
It was nice to have the doors open today and actually feel a little chilly!The photos above are from the trip I took with my friend Carol to Nashville last weekend.
We had a great time -- it was nice to get away.
But, I realized on the trip how much I rely on my husband these days.
He can pick up when I need help and steps right in.
I felt bad having to ask Carol to count my change out for me at a restaurant or to steer me in the right direction when we were going somewhere.
She is a true friend let me tell you!
Things are gearing up rather quickly for the walk.
It will be here in about 8 days.
Our team, Team Athens has raised almost $10,000 and we will have met that total and more by the time the walk rolls around next weekend.
Next week, is another conference call with the advocacy group that I am on from the National Alzheimer's office.
It is exciting to hear all that is happening out there and how engaged the whole group is in their work to help fight this disease.
I know that several major news outlets are planning some stories about Alzheimer's in the coming months.
That's about all I can say about that for now but I'll be able to report more later.
Ralph and I just returned from S.C. where we played golf at a state park.
It was enjoyable but after a few holes I lose my concentration and it gets difficult.
But I enjoy being outside and it was a beautiful day.
Since my golf isn't that good to begin with I always say it is just another "walk in the park" for me.

Lots of things have been swirling around in my head these days but getting them to this blog in a way that I can clearly communicate becomes another matter.
Since my son's birthday is coming up I have been thinking a lot about birthdays.
How we celebrate them and other holidays is usually based on our upbringing.
For instance, my father was pretty much an orphan growing up and at Christmas time he liked to have lots of little presents because as a child he didn't have any presents.
We would wrap up everything and anything so he would have lots of presents.
He was into fishing so we would buy individual lures and wrap them up and he would take his time opening each one and admiring them.
It was fun to watch his amazement at each present.
Our family always made a big deal of birthdays with family around to celebrate.
My husband celebrates birthdays in a whole different way.
I don't ever recall him saying his family didn't celebrate birthdays and I have photos to show that they did indeed have family gatherings.
When it comes to mine or his family he is pretty blase about it.
When asked why I didn't get a birthday present it was because he couldn't find something "he" liked -- not what I might like but what he liked.
Or I would recieve something that he wanted so he bought it for my birthday.
Or if there was something particular I wanted I would show him in a catalog the exact item I wanted, he would do research on the internet or consumer reports and buy something he thought I would like better.
When his mother was still living I was the one buying her birthday and Christmas presents -- I gave up on his brothers.
At least I tried.
When I realized that there was a pattern here I was determined that if we had children that birthdays would be special for them.
And, he has pretty much gone along with it.
He starts asking several months in advance of Alan's birthday what he wants or wants to be sure we have enough presents for Alan for Christmas.
I guess that proves that some things anyway change when you have children!
We have a bake sale today for our Memory Walk.
The Walk's in two weeks.
I hope we have nice weather for it.

<doc date=Thursday, October 04, 2007>
I've rested some from the Nashville trip.
My friend Carol was so great with me.
She did all the driving, helped me manage crossing the street at the right time, and helped me make change when I needed it.
I'm used to my husband helping me do simple stuff, so I forget that I actually need help sometimes!I'll post some photos at some point.
I just need to sift through all of them.October always seems to be a month of reflection for me.
I suppose it is because it is the month of my son's birthday.
I've written on this blog before how I have written my son a letter on his birthday every year beginning on the day he was born.
All through the year I save things for the letter and about September I start thinking about what I am really going to write.Well, I have just a few weeks and the pressure is on!
Not really, I enjoy doing it and now probably more than ever because I don't know if next year I will be able to.
You never know about anything in life let alone when you have a crazy disease.
All of the letters to date are in the safety deposit box and will be given to him at some point.
This year has been tough for Alan in many ways -- growing up isn't always fun.
But he will look back on this year later and realize how much he learned and what it took to get where he is.
I miss him a lot.
It looks as if he will be working in Washington DC next year after graduation so at least he will be closer.It's finally getting a little cooler here in the south.
But we still need rain.
There was an article in the paper this morning that if we don't get rain soon, we will be out of water by mid-December.
That's a little frightening!Thanks to all who have supported me with Memory Walk this year.
The walk is in three weeks and if you would still like to donate you can athttps://www.kintera.org/faf/donorReg/donorPledge.asp?ievent=223554&lis=1&kntae223554=8E1450127EA74F88A5546C2F816E0116&supId=9079347

I've been gone for a few days with a girlfriend for a girls weekend away.
We went to Nashville and had a great time.
I'll write about that later -- I need to rest up!But, I did want to bring a few things to the attention of many of you who read this blog on a regular basis.Two colleagues of mine that serve with me on the Early Stage Advocacy Group are doing something pretty special.
They are organizing an Early Stage Alzheimer's Conference in Los Angelese, CA on October 27th.
The LA Times had an article about them this week and I have posted the link.
(you will need to register for the LA Times but it is free).
The link is http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/california/la-me-dementia30sep30,1,6421737.story?page=2&coll=la-headlines-pe-californiaFor more information about the conference you can go to www.alzla.org/earlystageforumIt's only $25.00 for those with the disease and $75 for professional caregivers.
If you are in the LA area and can attend this event I urge you to do so.
Rich and Jay know what they are doing and I know that you would find it valuable.Another event that is a few months away is the next Town Hall meeting put on by the National Alzheimer's Association.
This Town Hall meeting is meant and designed for people that have Early On-Set Alzheimer's.
The meeting is being held on December 1st in Spartanburg, SC.
I attended one of these in Chicago and it was great.
For more information on this meeting go to http://www.alz.org/townhall/ and register.

I know you have all read my rants and raves about my social security disability ventures.
Well, nothing has really changed, I'm still waiting to see a judge for a hearing.....it has been over 24 months we have been waiting and still don't know when we'll get our hearing.
I was just informed of a new bill being introduced by a Congressman from New Mexico, that will change the two year waiting period for those on Social Security Disability to get Medicare.
I know that I have heard from many of you on this subject through email and your comments.

One of our two cats passed away this morning.
I woke up around 5:30 and fed both of them.
At around 6 I left to go to the gym and noticed that one of them was asleep on the living room floor.
When I came home she was in the exact same position so I went to check on her and found her dead.
I guess she had a heart attack -- at least she didn't suffer.
She was old -- about 14 years old but it is sad when you lose a member of your family.My husband came home last night from St. Louis.
I'm glad that didn't happen while he was away.

<doc date=Sunday, September 23, 2007>
My husband has been gone for a few days visiting his brother in St. Louis.
I cannot believe what a difference having him gone has meant to me.
This isn't suppose to sound bad, although I know when you read it, it will  sound that way.
I forgot what it was like when he wasn't around all the time.
I am not as tired as I usually am.
I think that not having to deal with him all day really makes a difference.
And, by "dealing with him" I mean, just having him around talking to me, having the television set on most of the time and knowing that my brain should at least be engaged all day takes a toll on me.
I don't think the television set has been on at all since he has been gone other than to watch the Georgia football game on Saturday.
The constant noise of the television wears on me.
It wasn't so bad when my husband was working because I could have all that quiet time to myself during the day.
What a difference a little noise makes!

We returned from Washington DC and I'm still trying to process all the information from the meeting we attended.
I'm not sure how much of the information we learned is proprietary so I don't want to say a whole lot at this time.
The meeting had a lot of heavy hitters in the room and the topic was basically about trying to get a handle on what everyone is doing in the realm of dealing with Alzheimer's and how we can work together.
I was privileged to be there and am thankful that they solicited the input of those with the disease and the families that are caring for them.
I know that this is just the beginning and with the energy in the room I am hopeful that a lot of minds will be working on how we move forward at this point.Ralph is leaving for St. Louis today to visit his brothers.
I'll be working on some Memory Walk projects while he is gone.
And, resting -- I can't believe how long it takes me to get back to what I consider "normal" after a trip.

The photo above was taken this summer when my son and his fiancee Jennifer were home.
A wedding date hasn't been set yet, but we are hoping that it will be set by the end of this month.The trip to Peoria was a good one, but exhausting.
Ralph and I are headed to Washington DC for an Alzheimer's meeting on Monday and then back home on Tuesday.
We have a little more travel in the next couple of weeks, but then things may slow down a bit.
The Memory Walk is October 20th and we are gearing up for that as well.My son is going through the final process of trying to get a federal clerkship after he graduates in May.
It is a rough, rigorous and competitive process and no matter what the outcome for him it will be a good learning experience.
I have to keep reminding him that even if he doesn't get a clerkship, he will still end up with a law degree from Stanford and that is definitely worth something!
As far as my health goes, things are o.k.
Went to the doctor last week and of course, there isn't much he can say other than "come back in six months".
I think we all feel a sense of helplessness -- knowing we can't do anything right now to slow this down.
You do the best you can and carry on.

I'm sure my son is going to read this and figure that this post is for him.
But, it isn't.
I'm still in Illinois visiting my brothers but will be heading home later today.
I have been able to see lots of folks that I haven't seen for awhile.
While visiting, there seems to be a theme in what we talked about -- disappointment in things not going the way people were hoping for.
It's hard to understand why some things don't go our way.
I've never been real religious but I do believe that things happen for a reason.
Or at least, in my life I believe they do.
It might be hard to see at the time, but later on I have been able to look back at things and realize why I didn't get a certain job, a certain grade, a certain opportunity.
It might have been a few days later, a few months later or even a few years later, but the reason has always presented itself.
In talking with friends here (as well as my son this week) they have shared some disappointment in something not going their way.
Most of the time, when things have not gone my way, it has been for the better.
I wasn't always happy about it at the time, but when looking back it definitely was for the better -- I wouldn't have had a chance to meet some people, or to make as much money or to be happy.
I've often written about my husband being very pessimisstic.
His response to that is "if I don't get my hopes up about something,  then I won't be disappointed if things go bad."
I'm not sure that is the right way to look at things, but each to his own I guess.I think you have to be positive and then live with what happens as bad as it might hurt or not feel right at the time.
Everything is not going to go your way every time.
You just have to hope that you can handle what is thrown at you.
I certainly didn't want to get Alzheimer's -- but it has happened for a reason and I accept that.
I don't see many other alternatives at this point so you make the best of it.
I've certainly grown as a person and value my time with my friends and family so much more.
I think, too, that we have to learn from all of these opportunities.
It certainly won't be the last time we are disappointed by something and hopefully the next time it happens you will be ready for it -- or at least realize that it is not the end of the world.
Learn from it and move on.
Life is way too short.

I'm off to Illinois tomorrow to visit my brothers and family.
It's been way too long since I have seen them.
I'll get a chance to see some other true friends and I'm glad they are going to be able to take some time for me.My golf game stunk yesterday.
I'm going to have my brother help me some when I'm home.
He'll know what to do.Busy week when I return on Monday -- have several memory walk meetings and then we are off to Washington DC for some more Alzheimer's meetings.More soon.

Boy it sure took me a lot longer to recuperate from my trip to Chicago.
I was so tired after only being gone a few days.
It has been hard to get back into my daily routine -- thought I was coming down with a cold, but it just turned out to be exhaustion.
I'm traveling to central Illinois to visit my brothers at the end of this week, but I know I will have more downtime than when I was in Chicago so hopefully, that will not be as bad.I went to the UGA football game last night.
We don't have season tickets, but a friend of mine called and had an extra ticket so I was his date.
I haven't been to a game for a couple of years so it was nice to go.
Some friends of mine that go to every game gave me a ride and stayed with me until I caught up with my friend.
Then my friend walked me back to a meeting place for my ride home so I wasn't alone.
The stadium was sold out which means over 92,000 people were in attendance, so I was glad I wasn't alone!
I really got tired after the half and it was hard for me to follow the game.
Having the game in the evening was also hard for me because I'm not at my best in the evening.
But, I'm glad I went -- it will probably be the only game I go to all season and it was a nice night for a game.
And, we won!

We returned late last night from Chicago where we had our first meeting of the Early Stage Advocacy Group for the Alzheimer's Association.
Fourteen people with Early Stage Alzheimer's had been selected to serve on this committee.
We have had a conference call to get to know each other a little better, but this weekend was the first time that all of us actually got to meet each other (except one who had another committment).
I was not sure what to expect.
Let's say that I was overwhelmed at the other people on this committment.
What top notch people to be serving on an advisory board such as this.The committee is composed of three women and eleven men.
We have retired architects, doctors, IT specialists, banking and finance executives, artists, musicians -- you name it.
I'm not sure that I quite measure up to everyone but I'm certainly going to do my best.
I was so impressed by this group and I am certainly honored to be among them.
One of the members of our committee is still working and he is a police chief in a small town in Central Illinois -- not far from where I am originally from.
He is very articulate.
He has gotten a lot of national press because there is curiosity out there about him having Alzheimer's and carrying a weapon.
I would be more than happy to rely on him for my defense if I ever needed it!
And, he said, after one of our meetings, that he felt that he has found a whole new community and lifelong friends after meeting for just a few hours.
I whole heartedly agree with that and am certainly looking forward to working on the tasks put before us.Those tasks will be many as there are things to be looked at like advocacy work, programming and awareness.
I appreciate the Alzheimer's Association so much for asking us to do this and getting our feedback.
Now as to the bad news -- A new drug called Alzhamed has been in clinical trials for some time and many of us have been hoping that this drug would be a big breakthrough in treatment.
The optimistic side of this drug was that it had the potential to help slow the progession of Alzheimer's.
Well, the trials have not shown these results and basically the drug is not an option.
There are some other drugs in the pipeline, but much further down the pipeline -- we were all hoping for such great things.
It's very sad news.Here is a link to a news story about it http://www.reuters.com/article/health-SP/idUSN2638111620070827

The heat is still here -- and it looks like it will be for a few more weeks.
It can't leave too soon as far as I 'm concerned!
This weekend we had a house full for dinner.
Alan and his fiancee and her parents along with three other couples came for dinner.
We got a little more information about what Jennifer was thinking about their wedding.
Which, I was glad to hear, fit into the same lines as I was thinking.
But the date still remains unset.
The reason for that is that my son is waiting to hear if he is going to get a federal clerkship when he graduates from Law School next May.
That determines a lot of things for them and he will know by the end of September.
So we don't have much longer to wait.
The law firm he was working for in Washington DC has offered him a job when he gets out and we are hoping the firm in Atlanta will do the same.
At least he has some options.At the end of this week we venture to Chicago for my first meeting with the Early Advocacy committee.
I'm looking forward to it and getting away even if it is only for a few days.
I'm tired after the busy weekend so I need to rest up before this weekend.

The heat is still here.
It's hard to do a lot when it stays in the 100 degree mark every day.
Hopefully, next week we will get some relief.I am getting ready for my trip to Chicago next week for the Early On Set Advisory group meeting.
I'm really anxious to be able to meet everyone.
All of my other colleagues sound so ambitious, I hope I can keep up!Memory Walk work is starting to heat up as well.
Although our walk isn't until October, it is amazing how quick it will be here.
I hope you have been seeing all the advertising the national office has been doing on the Memory Walk.
It certainly has generated some interest.My son and his fiancee and her parents are visiting this weekend.
We haven't all been together since last December, when my husband fell and broke his elbow while we were ice skating.
It will be nice to see everyone again.
My son finishes his internship up next week in Atlanta and will be heading back to California for his remaining year in law school.
The summer has certainly gone quick.
</doc>
<doc date=Thursday, August 09, 2007>
is awful.
I know it is hot in many places.
Today it reached 105 degrees in Athens, GA -- a new record.
I think it is suppose to be just as hot tomorrow.
The heat is getting the best of me.
We went out and played golf a few days ago.
We walk the course because we like the exercise.
We finished up around 12:30 and it was close to 100 degrees at that point.
I don't know what we were thinking -- I guess we weren't thinking if truth be told.
The heat never used to bother me much -- but I certainly feel it now.I guess the "lazy days of summer" will continue for awhile.

My "word" problems are really annoying me.
I have posted before that I am having problems finding the right words, understanding things I read and using the wrong words.
I've noticed lately that I have a real problem with words that sound the same but are spelled differently and mean different things -- I can't remember the name for these words -- for example, meat and meet, right and write -- you get the idea.
I know the word I mean when I write it (I had to think about that) but I'm not sure which is correct after I put it down on paper -- see how I avoided that?
I will use the tools on the computer sometimes to check myself, and the last few times I was wrong.
It's so frustrating when communications has meant so much in my life.
So, chalk it up to this disease if you read something silly I've written.On another note, the Alzheimer's Association is hosting some "Town Hall Meetings" about Alzheimer's.
The first one was last week in Oakland California.
I will be part of one in Chicago at the end of the month and there will also be one in Spartanburg, SC and Washington DC.
If you are close to any of these areas I would encourage you to attend.
Here is a link to the Alzheimer's website that tells you more about it.
-- it's important for us to keep the dialogue open about Alzheimer's.

This past week we went over to visit my son in Atlanta.
We wanted to see the law firm he is working in and had a nice lunch.
He only has about four more weeks before he heads back to Stanford for his final year in law school.
Hopefully, my health will still be good that I will get to see him graduate next May.
I have a couple of days of meetings planned in Atlanta this week and that usually takes its toll on me -- fatigue sets in so quickly these days.
I think I'm going to get a lot accomplished and then by the end of the day I wonder where the day went.
Next week, my 11 year old great niece is visiting us.
Her father lives not far from here and when she comes to visit him, she comes to see us.
We aren't used to having someone so young around so it is refreshing.
I'm planning a trip back home to Illinois in September.
It has been almost a year and a half since I have been home to visit my brothers.
It's a trip long overdue.More later this week when I return from Atlanta.

I wrote several weeks ago about my acceptance into an Early Stage Advocacy Group out of the national office of the Alzheimer's Association.
Well, last week, we had our first conference call that consisted of Alzheimer's staff as well as the fourteen people that comprise the group.
All of us have Early Stage Alzheimer's and the majority are Early on-set (under the age of 65).
It was interesting to hear their stories and to share our thoughts.
We will be meeting face to face at the end of August at a meeting in Chicago.
I'm anxious to meet all of them as we all share the passion to do what we can to help fight this dreaded disease.Our role will be to act as advisors to the Association as well as to be national spokespeople for the cause.
It seems we are all rather out spoken and we each have our own little niches that we interested in.
Many are interested in helping to educate the medical field more about what we go through, some are intersted in lobbying congress for more money, everyone wants to help educate the public and raise awareness to help get funds for research.It's a very diverse group and I am honored to be one of the fourteen.
One major initiative this year for the Association is to have regional town meetings to discuss Alzheimer's.
There will be one in Chicago while we are there, state chapters will have them and there will also be virtual town meetings.
If you are interested in any of these, you can check out more information on the National Alzheimer's website at www.alz.org.

Last night my husband and I went out to dinner with a couple from the Atlanta area.
The man has early on-set alzheimer's and is close to my age.
We had a good time over dinner getting to know them and learning more about what they have been through.
I hope this is a start of a new friendship for us.....we really enjoyed being with them and we certainly can relate to their situation.
I've been playing golf a few times over the last week and got some tennis in with my son over the weekend.
Didn't do real well at either but at least it is exercise!
It's amazing how quick my concentration can go.
But, I try to hang in there.Things have been a little slow.
I'll post more soon.

I've been getting lots of feedback from some of my posts.
Some of them have been added to this blog -- others not for various reasons.
Thanks to all who have taken the time to submit a comment.
Lots of interest in the Early Stage advisory group I described recently.
Many have specific questions and if you would like to email me at krisbga@hotmail.com I would be more than happy to answer them individually.
This is the second year of the Association having the advisory group and many areas were identified last year that need to be addressed.
The whole group will be meeting in Chicago at the end of August for our first meeting I will have more to report at that time.In the mean time if you check out the alz.org website you find some events that are upcoming relating to this group.
Specifically, there will be a series of town hall meetings held across the country to open up the dialogue on Alzheimer's.
I would encourage you to go if there is one in your area.

to everyone.
My week has been kind of quiet -- which is a good thing since we have been on the go.
It has been good to rest for awhile.
We don't have any major plans to travel any more this summer, until the end of August.
My son is now in California only to return in a couple of days to Atlanta.
He just ended his first "summer associate" program in Washington DC and will be started a second one next week at a law firm in Atlanta.
Although I know I won't see him much while he is here -- it will be like when he was at Georgia Tech for four years -- I knew that he was close enough that I "could touch him if I needed to".
When he moved to California to Stanford that was a little harder for me to take.I've been trying to play golf and tennis.
My concentration lags a good bit but I keep at it.
I love being outdoors and I'm getting some exercise to boot.
I'm so competitive that I hate losing -- so that is the hardest part!
I'm getting over it though -- or trying to at least.

Last year, the National Alzheimer's Association created an Early Stage Advisory group to deal with the particular problems those of us with Early Stage Alzheimer's have to deal with.
Some of our issues are different than those in late stages mainly because we are still somewhat functional, many still work, and many are in their 40's and 50's.
Insurance, disability, social security, job security, family issues come in to play and need to be dealt with in a different way.
I was so pleased that they came up with this and in their first year were very aggressive in the areas they addressed and wanted to help change.This year, I have been invited to be on this Advisory Panel.
I'm please to have been selected and hope that I can do it justice.
We will be engaged throughout the year as advocates and spokespersons for the association and Early Stage Alzheimer's.
I know from many of your comments and emails that I have received from others in the same boat that there are issues out there you want addressed as well.
I hear you and will definitely bring those to the table.
Feel free to leave me a comment if you have some of your own ideas.

Every month we go out to dinner with three other couples.
Each month a different couple gets to pick where they want to go.
Last night was one of our dinner nights.
But, I had had a bad day with panic attacks and noise bothering me a good bit.
I was at the gym and had a major panic attack, but I stuck it out and then came home.
Last night as we were eating dinner I several small attacks just because of the noise I think and I just felt a "little off".
I was quiet I know and it was difficult to carry on a conversation.
I always try to sit on the end of the table becasue then I don't have conversation coming from both sides at me.
But, that didn't help much.After dinner, one of the couples invited us over for dessert and I couldn't go.
I made my husband go without me and I felt bad about that.
But I just needed to be home where I felt "safe".
Hopefully, my friends understand that.
I hate it when that happens.

We just returned from a few days in Washington DC to visit our son.
He's working for a law firm there for just two more weeks (see above).
Then in July he will be coming to Atlanta to start a job there with a law firm.
It's nice to have him on this side of the country for awhile.We had a good time visiting and checking everything out in Washington DC again.
We tried to go places we hadn't been to before.
I certainly felt like the ball at the end of the chain though.
I certainly couldn't have done that trip by myself -- way too confusing.
I got tired pretty quick and tried to stay up with everything but it was hard.
The one thing I realized when we were there though was that you can tell when your child has become an adult when he reaches for the check at a restaurant before you do -- and then actually pays!While we were visiting him, his fiancee's parents were visiting her and her sister on the west coast.
Jennifer's sister took an internship in California and is staying with her this summer.
We were glad to hear that and we are glad they are all getting a chance to visit.
Promise more soon -- I need to rest!

Today, Monday, some new research is going to be unveiled in Washington DC regarding some new drugs that are on the horizon to fight Alzheimer's.
I've been hearing about them for several years and I'm anxious to hear the results of the testing.
I've heard some rumors that the research is not going to show the kind of results that I was hoping for, but I hope that is just a rumor.
In the next few days you will be hearing a lot about several drugs that are in the pipeline.
And, I'm told that Newsweek is going to do be doing a cover article on Alzheimer's in the next couple of weeks.

On Wednesday, I visited my neurologist.
After my last visit we decided it was time for another MRI since my language problems had become persistent.
The MRI revealed that on a whole there was some atrophy of my brain from the last MRI but there was significant atrophy in the area of my brain that controls my verbal communication.
Needless to say, I wasn't pleased, but I guess it is what I expected considering my problems.
I have been upset about it for the last day and I know I need to get over it because there isn't anything I can do about it.
I need to live one day at a time.

I've had one of those weeks where it has been really hard to concentrate....forgetting lots of words and organizing things have been difficult.
Last year I started making note cards from some of my scrapbooking left overs.
I am selling them with the proceeds to go to the Memory Walk.
I had a big order from someone and sat down to do it and realized how hard it was to actually put them together.
All I could concentrate on was some cutting and pasting (which I flunked in kindergarten) some of the embellishments that went on the cards, I just couldn't figure out how to assemble them.
So that is what I did for awhile.
I was able to get my order out with what I had in stock pile, but it was frustrating to not be able to do what I enjoy.Tomorrow I am heading to Atlanta to shoot a national tv spot for the Alzheimer's Association for this year's Memory Walk.
It is going to be shot in Piedmont Park and really pretty area right in downtown Atlanta.
It is going to be in the 90's so we will see how "cool, calm and collected" I will be!I'm off again this weekend.
And, while I'm gone, my son will be flying in for a very brief span of time to attend a retreat in North Carolina.
Hopefully, I'll get to visit with him for a few hours when he gets escorted back to the Atlanta airport on his return trip to Washington DC.More after the weekend.

We went to Hickory NC over the weekend.
We visited some friends that used to live in Athens and attended a wedding of a friend of mine.
Many of you have been following my blog for awhile and may recall that last year, I wrote about a young man that had a skiing accident in Colorado and almost died.
He had some head trauma, lost sight in one of his eyes as well as many broken bones.
His fiancee was finishing up her studies at Georgia and went to be by his bedside for several months and still managed to graduate on time.
She is a remarkable young woman.
I got to know her through Memory Walk here in Athens.
She chaired the event and did a marvelous job.
Due to the accident the wedding was put on hold, and finally, this weekend, they tied the knot.
It was an extremely emotional weekend for everyone, because of the severity of Brad's accident.I'm so pleased they allowed us to share in their special day.
But it was a long weekend for me and I have to rest for awhile.
I just wanted to share this story.

I have finally rested a little after my trip to Minneapolis.
It was a great trip even though it was so short.
I was part of a panel that spoke to a group from Golden Clinical Services, part of Golden Ventures.
It was a training session for their employees on Alzheimer's Care.
They were so nice to us.
Also on the panel were two gentleman from Minnesota that I have been working with for a few months on this and it was nice to finally meet them.
I really appreciate this company working with their employees to understand this disease.
Thanks for having me.To my Illinois friends out there, just wanted to say that I'm sorry for you that Illinois didn't win the NCAA Tennis tournament against Georgia.
However, this capped off Georgia's undefeated season so I am glad they won.
Illinois made a great move by beating some top ranked teams to get to the final.
They had a lot of supporters in the crowd and were very vocal!We are off to a wedding in North Carolina this weekend.
And, get to see an old friend that used to live in Athens.

It's been awhile I know.
I've been busy and I've been exhausted.
It's hard for me to write when I am tired.
My concentration level is not what it used to be!
I've been off on my days all week, thinking it was one day when it was another.
I think I must be anxious for this week to end!
On Monday, I'm off to Minneapolis for a speaking engagement.
I'll get to meet some new folks with dementia.
I've been working with them via conference calls for a couple of months so it will be nice to meet them.
Those connections are vital to me.I'll be back on line when I return and have rested up.
</doc>
<doc date=Thursday, May 10, 2007>
I'm gearing up for a few busy weeks.
As I tired as I get I need to pace myself.
Next week I am going to begin volunteering for the NCAA women and men's tennis tournament to be held here.
The men's tournament has been here for many years and we always go to watch.
This year both the men's and the women's tourney is being held at the same time and they needed some people to work.
I can't do much that requires a lot of concentration for a long period of time, but at least I might feel useful.
In the middle of that I'm going to Minneapolis to speak to a group on what it is like to have Alzheimer's.
There will be several people on a panel and I'm anxious to go and see some old friends.
It will be an exhausting trip for me and I know I will need a few days to recover.Over the Memorial Day weekend we are going to a friend's wedding in North Carolina.
This lovely young lady that is getting married was the Chair of our first Memory Walk here in Athens.
She was going to UGA at the time and her sorority, Sigma Kappa, supports Alzheimer's as their philanthropic interest and she was in charge.
She is a remarkable young lady.
She now lives in Denver and works for a pharmaceutical company.
I'm so glad she is getting married and I haven't seen her in over a year so I'm glad that we will be part of her special day.
I just have to remember to pace myself!In June we finally get to see the kid in Washington DC.
It seems like he is settling in to his new job at the law firm up there.
I'm sure he will have lots to show us and tell us.Speaking of the Memory Walk -- the date for Athens' is Saturday October 20th.
Your support is definitely needed.
And, if you get a chance, check out the national Alzheimer's Website at www.alz.org.
They have a great new ad campaign that is coming out and hopefully will help raise awareness.
Some big names have lended their support to the program and I am excited to see that happening.
The best of Mother's Day to all of you out there.

I think I have finally rested up from a busy week last week.
My husband and I volunteered at a pro golf tournament held locally.
It was about as much as I could do -- it was rather exhausting -- but it makes me feel useful!
My son is finishing up his second year at law school at Stanford this week.
Next Monday he starts a new job at a law firm in Washington DC.
I'm just glad that he is going to be in the same time zone as we are for a change!
It's an exciting time for him.
I miss him alot.
I was thinking that this is the longest time I have been without seeing him and I still have six weeks to go before we make a visit to Washington DC.
I know, though, that I am lucky that at least I do get to see him as often as I do.
I know there are many parents that have children that live much farther away and don't get to see them.
Many of you have asked how the wedding plans are coming for Alan and Jennifer.
Don't know much as I'm not sure that they have made many decisions.
Hopefully more details will be coming soon.It is suppose to be 92 degrees here in Athens today.
That is just too hot already for just the first of May.

Yesterday I attended a wedding of a former employee.
Pictured above is me with him (right) and another former employee who was the best man.
They are both just a little older than my son and came to work for me when my son had left for college.
I guess I kind of looked at them as my "surrogate sons" when they worked for me and they have sinced stayed friends of mine.
They are great guys and I am so glad that our paths crossed in life and I can consider them "family".
They have moved away so I don't see them very often, but I do see their parents and we stay in touch when we can.
Friends are important in life....don't forget that!

I know many of you are aware of the trouble I have had getting my social security disability.
I don't understand why some get it right away and others have to wait so long.
I've been denied many times and "my case" is suppose to go before a judge in Atlanta to determine whether or not I will get it.
My disability insurance company told me I had to apply when I started receiving my disability checks.
After gettting rejected several times they hired an attorney to help us through the process.When the attorney initially contacted me, he sent me letters telling me that a judge should hear my case within 90 days of application but because the Atlanta Social Security hearing offices were so backlogged it could be as long as a year before they heard my case.
It is now 21 months later and still nothing!I received a letter from the attorney yesterday telling me that it will be "several more months" before they even begin working on it.
My file remains unworked and unassigned at this time.My attorney also sent this notice to me:"There are 141 Social Security Hearing Offices in the US.
As of January 2007, Downtown Atlanta is at the very bottom of the list -- Number 141!
The other local hearing office, Atlanta North, is Number 131 in terms of the longest delays.The Atlanta North hearing office now has a docket of over 11,000 cases.
To deal with this staggering case load, they have seven fewer employees than several years ago when they were dealing with a 2,500 case backlog.
To make matters worse, two of the nine judges are retiring soon, and there are no current plans to replace them.
"I'm o.k.
for now, but what about all those people that rely solely on Social Security Disability?

Hug your kids, hug your families -- the tragedy at Virginia Tech reminds us once again how precious life is.
What a senseless act.
My best friend from college has a son that goes to Virginia Tech and he is an engineering major.
I have tried to contact her but I haven't been able to get in touch with her yet to see if her son is o.k.
Life is just too short for some.

was our 27th wedding anniversary.
The time certainly flies.
I guess none of us knows what we are getting into when we marry ......
I just wish my family didn't have to carry this burden with me.Yesterday also brought a trip to the neurologist.
He's changing up my medicine a little and it is time for another CT scan of my brain.
It's been awhile so we'll see if we can find some changes.
I have had increasing problems with finding the right words for things lately.
That is so frustrating.
I can see it in my head but I can't find it!

I had a busy week last week and got out of my "routine".
I noticed that my panic attacks were worse last week.
We had a garage sale with several other families and it was held at our house.
We had the opportunity to do a lot of spring cleaning, but at the same time, it created upheaval around our house because things weren't where they were suppose to be.
The house was a mess, our garage was full of "stuff" and things were just not "normal".
It is amazing how this affects me.
But it is over now and the money we raised from the garage sale is a start for our Memory Walk this year.Also, the mother of a close friend of my son's, passed away last week and that always gets me much more emotional than I used to be.
She was only 55 too and it was such a shock to everyone.
She had four children and Alan's friend read a eulogy that one of her other sisters had written.
It was so sad.
Those things stick longer with me now -- I don't know if it is the disease or the fact that I am getting older and people are passing away that are close to my age or just before their time.
</doc>
<doc date=Sunday, April 01, 2007>
my son and his girlfriend of almost five years got officially engaged last week.
They went to Hawaii for Alan's spring break and he finally popped the question.
Details to follow, but now I'll have another female in the family.
Have two brothers, my husband having two brothers and me having a son -- it will be nice to have a female as part of our family.....welcome Jennifer Lee.And, even though this is being written on April Fool's Day -- it is not a joke.The pollen in the south has been horrendous.
The yellow green color that it leaves everywhere literally can take your breath away.
We are suppose to have rain today and that will certainly help.This week I had a test done at a local hospital on my left leg.
The leg has been swelling and at first there was reason to believe that I had a blood clot in my leg.
But after tests for that it was determined that was not the cause.
Now the doctors believe that the problem lies in my lymph system.
Anyway, I went to the hospital to have this test done -- I don't remember the name of it -- but it entailed having some fluid injected into my feet and then they watched the fluid stream through my body.
It doesn't sound so bad, but the shots were given between my toes on each foot!!!
Sounds awful.....it was awful.
I have had several cortisone shots for various things over the years and it was very close to that -- which caused me excruitating pain.
And, it also topped right up there with getting two spinal taps during my diagnosis for Alzheimer's.
What fun I have had.
Results will be in next week on my leg.
It's not life threatening -- just a nuisance more than anything.

Many of my friends have recently passed some milestone birthdays so I guess that always makes me feel older too.
And, with it comes stories of failing health in some form or another.
Do we just neglect ourselves in all that we have to do, do we overdo things because our bodies are what they used to be or is it "just getting old"?
I've tried to keep remember what some doctors have told me about my Alzheimer's.
That they are hoping with the drugs out there today and some to come on line soon, that their hope is for people like me to die of something else rather than the Alzheimers.
Of course, I hope this is true as the downward spiral for someone with Alzheimer's isn't exactly pretty.
But some other diseases are not either.Spring has sprung in the south and with it comes the dreadful pollen.
I have never seen it this bad although my husband says it has been.
I suffer from allergies and when you can't go outside because the pollen is so thick in the air it is bad.
The range for the pollen is up in the 5000 range (whatever that means) and if you consider that the "high range" is 150, you realize how bad it is.
The streets, cars and any surface outside are covered with this yellow green dusting.
I remember when I was playing tennis with this pollen that you can see where the ball bounced because it would leave a mark in the pollen.
We are hoping for rain to help clear some of it out.I'm having some circulation problems in my left leg so am going to the hospital for some tests tomorrow.
The name of the test is too long for me to remember, but they will basically be shooting dye up my leg to watch the flow of it.
The doctor thinks I have lymphodema -- which isn't life threatening -- more of a pain and a nuisance.On a lighter note, my son and his girlfriend are in Hawaii on his spring break right now.
Ever since moving to California they have wanted to go since it is a lot cheaper if you are starting out in California.
I hope they have a good trip.
They have both worked hard to get there.

from Minneapolis.
It was really cold up there!
Our team won two games and now they are on to the Sweet Sixteen in Dallas.
I'm going to have to bypass that trip -- it is just too hard for me.
Thankfully, I had my husband and some other good travel companions with me on this trip to help me get through.
I'll post some photos soon.
Thanks for everyone's comments.
I promise to post more when I get some rest.In asnwer to someone's question, I am 51 years old and I was diagnosed at 46.

This weekend my husband and I are travelling with some other people to go to Minneapolis.
We are following the women's basketball team from the University of Georgia in their first and second rounds of the NCAA tournament.
He wasn't going to go originally but decided to.
That's good for me because it helps to have him along on trips.
It's hard for me to do some things with others without him around.
Or, I just don't feel like I can do them without some assistance and he is there to provide that.
It will probably do us so some good to get away.
I think I'm taking my ice skates.
Although, I have wondered whether I could take them on the plane as a carry on.
Do you suppose the blade on the skate would be considered "a weapon".
I guess I better check with the airlines.Happy St. Patrick's Day to everyone this weekend.

I feel like I am at a crossroads in my life.
And, I can't find the right words to express what I'm feeling.
It's very frustrating.
That is partly the reason that I haven't entered anything into this blog lately.
I'm just confused and it is hard to explain.
It's hard to ask for help when you can't describe what you are feeling.
Hopefully, this too shall pass.

<doc date=Thursday, March 01, 2007>
I have had somewhat of a "writer's block" lately so I apologize for not blogging more lately.
Soemtimes it is just hard for me to come up with the right words.When I was first diagnosed with Alzheimer's I made it a mission of mine to get into scrapbooking of some sort.
I had lots and lots of photos and they were catalogued or captioned and you probably know the drill.
It was always something I was going to get to.
Well, I decided that while I could still remember some things I would really work at getting all those photos and kid's drawings and momentos in a scrapbook.
It took me several months but I finally got caught up.
I was relieved when it was over, because at least I knew that my family would have some memories of our life even if I couldn't remember it.My project of late has been to work on a scrapbook for a friend of mine.
It is a secret so I won't go into who it is for and what the purpose is, but since I know this person doesn't read the blog I think it is pretty safe to talk about it in general terms.
I have solicited letters, stories and photos from friends to include in the scrapbook.
At times, I feel a little guilty in reading all the letters and stories about this person's life because they are so personal.
But at the same time, I am taken back by how much this person has meant to so many people during their lifetime.
You never really know what kind of an impact one person has on another until you read stories about them.
We take that kind of friendship for granted too often.
I look back and I can pinpoint several people during my lifetime that changed the way I am (was) and sometimes it is not the people you expect that change your life.
I'm not sure when I was growing up we called these people Mentors like we do today, but just the same they are important in our lives.
Sometimes we don't realize what an impact they had on our lives until way after the fact.
If there are people in your life that have affected you for the positive, let them know it, before it is too late.
There's no time like the present.

Over the weekend I had what I consider a "mini meltdown".
Many things had been building up and I guess I unleashed some of them.
I'm sure my husband would think this was a "major meltdown", but I guess the old saying is "you haven't seen anything yet" would apply.
The one thing my husband did say was "Is that you or the disease?".
I can say for 100 percent certainty that this meltdown was me!
Sometimes things I say or I do I can say that it is 100% the disease and sometimes I'm not sure.
I guess as the disease progresses it will be easier to tell.

I know I have said this before, but I tend to be a lot more emotional than I have ever been.
This past week, a very close friend shared some horrific news about something that is going on with her family.
I won't go into details, but it has affected me greatly.
I can't sleep, I think about it constantly and want to cry at the drop of a hat.
I don't know if this is good or bad but I know that five years ago I probably wouldn't have reacted this way.
The news still would have been bad, but I'm not sure I would have nightmares over it.
I'm glad my friend could confide in me and I wish there was something I could do to help, but there isn't.Again -- it puts other things in perspective.
Life just isn't fair.

can do strange things to you.
And, if you have Alzheimer's stress is probably one of the things you don't want to have to deal with because it makes it worse.
I've been under a lot of stress lately and that is part of the reason I haven't had many entries lately to this blog.
I haven't been able to find the right words.
I've been forgetting a lot lately and getting confused more than normal.
What is probably even odder, is that my dreams reflect my forgetfulness and confusion.
In my dreams lately I am mimicking (sp?)
my days.
Usually when I dream, I seem "normal" and don't have these problems.
Now they have caught up to me.
Maybe when I feel less stressful -- that too shall pass.

February is a weird month.
It's usually awful weather and everyone anticipates it being over to see the first signs of spring.Both my brothers and my father had a birthday in February so we always had some type of celebration going on it seemed.
Ironically, my best friend, my husband and my brother all have the same birthday.
Another couple we are friends with have their anniversary that same day.
It has always struck me odd how with 365 days in a year, that many people I know share the actual birthdays.
I know there are a lot of people in the world, but I don't know that many people.
I have four friends who share the same birthday with my late mother.
That just seems odd to me.A friend of mine in Illinois retired this week.
He wasn't quite ready to retire, but circumstances as they were, he felt that it was the right time.
He told me that his wife (also retired) was fine with it as long as he got up every morning and left to go somewhere at 8:00 a.m.
Retiring is certainly an adjustment and when there are two in the house it is even more so.
I don't adjust well to cerain things and just when I think I have the "adjustment period" of my husband's retiring over six months ago down, I realize I don't.
Maybe it is a constant "adjustment period".
The biggest thing I have noticed is that my husband has always been a very negative person.
I guess it didn't bother me as much when we were both working because we didn't see that much of each other.
But now, having to live with it 24 hours a day is wearing pretty thin on me.
I don't get it -- way too much energy is expended on being negative and for what reason?
I get to the point of not even wanting to talk with him because there is always something negative to come from it.
Life's just too short and as my son once said "gotta live it one day at a time".

I haven't written much lately -- I've been in a bad mood.
I don't like what I write when I'm in a bad mood and it seems lately I have been in a bad mood more than I have been in a good one.
I just don't feel like myself these days -- not happy with me, the way I look, the way I feel, just not happy about a lot of things.
This, too, shall pass -- I hope!Thanks to those that have commented lately.
I appreciate your feedback.
Nicole -- thank you and our thoughts and prayers are with you and your family.
Some comments I have not posted, but you know who you are and I thank you for them as well.My son is busy back at Stanford.
I don't know how he keeps up his rugged schedule.
I guess I was involved in a lot of things when I was in school -- you forget when you get older how much energy you used to have!
Alan's girlfriend, Jennifer, is in Shanghai this week on business.
Last week she was in Mexico.
I'm so glad she has an opportunity to travel with her job.
When I worked in Illinois I got that opportunity and while you might not realize it at the time (because you are working) it is nice to see new places.
It's even nicer to be able to go back to some of those places when you are not working!
They are planning a trip to Hawaii over spring break.The south has finally gotten some cold weather and we may be in for some icy conditions come Thursday.
But it is nice to finally have it feel like winter.

I received word last night that another friend with Alzheimer's lost her battle.
I had the privilege of meeting two remarkable women several years ago at the Alzheimer's Public Policy Forum in Washington DC.
They were a set of twins from my home state of Illinois -- one had Alzheimer's, one did not.
As twins go I guess they were like all twins, pretty close and inseparable.
The "well" twin dropped everything and took care of her sister.
These two women fought the battle as hard as anyone and did some amazing things to help raise awareness about Alzheimer's.
I heard from one of the twins last night that she lost her sister earlier this month.
I'm so sorry for their loss and it is our loss as well.
Thanks for being a part of my life and thanks for all you have done for the Alzheimer's cause.
I know your family will continue the fight.I've been in somewhat of a "funk" lately -- don't know what else to call it, but after learning of this tragic loss it gives this "funk" a different perspective.

I'm hoping all of this is a coincidence.1.Ten years ago I worked for a governmental agency here in town as the marketing director for special events.
The agency also handled many other tasks for the city and we had about 15 employees.
A friend of mine still works there and she called me and said "I have a present for you from Frances, I'll drop it by after work".
(Frances being one of the employees there).
I asked her why -- I haven't seen Frances in probably eight years.
She said that Frances' New Year's Resolution was to thank all the people in her life that have treated her kindly and I was at the top of the list.
She had thought about me a lot over the years and she said that I always did nice things for her and she wanted to do something nice for me.
I was pretty shocked to hear this, but I thought that was an extremely nice gesture on her part.
I always liked her and I guess the feeling was mutual.2.
When my son was in middle school and high school he was involved with a local community theatre group.
He performed in many musical theatre productions.
When he was in high school I joined him for a few of those performances so we could "experience the stage together".
It was lots of fun for me -- probably not as much fun for him -- having your mom in a show with you when you were in high school.
But that is beside the point.
We obviously became friends with the director of this community theatre group but I haven't seen him in a long time.
I've been to a few shows in the past couple of years, but haven't really spent much time with him to speak of.
I got an email from him this weekend -- he wanted to have lunch or dinner to catch up.
I was really pleased to get that email because I know how busy he is.3.
Out of the blue I received another email this weekend from a long lost friend.
I haven't seen her for probably 10 years.
She had gotten my email address through a mutual friend and wanted "to reconnect".
We never had a falling out or anything, in fact it was a good friendship.
However, we both went our separate ways both professionally and personally.
We just lost touch.
Now she is reaching out and I'm so glad.So, is it just a coincidence that three people I haven't kept in touch with on a regular basis have contacted me?
Or do they know something I don't?

I know it has been awhile since I last posted.
I think I have finally settled back into my routine since my son returned to Stanford.
Although, things won't be back to "normal" until my husband gets out of his cast and can drive again.
I do o.k.
getting around early in the morning when there are not too many people on the road but after about 10:00 a.m.
I don't do very well.My medicine and I have not been getting along so well the last week or so -- I hope it is not time to change again.
I guess we'll have to see what the doctor says at my next appointment.I wake up in the middle of the night and think about things to put in this blog and I don't write them down.
So, by the next morning I don't remember.
I'm afraid that if I wake up long enough to write them down, I won't go back to sleep.
That's kind of silly, though, since I don't seem to go back to sleep too easily anyway.
The doctor has me on a sleeping pill but I don't think it is doing much good.
Hopefully this blog will have a new look soon.
My son and I discussed it when he was home and he has promised to do a facelift on it!

A nice Christmas photo and then a few days later -- after surgery for his broken elbow.
</doc>
<doc date=Sunday, December 31, 2006>
It's New Year's Eve and I'm ready to get life back to "normal" whatever that is.
I've been out of my routine for a while with all the things going on over the holidays and I can tell its effect on me.
Now with my husband's accident it is going to be different as well.
It's o.k.
as long as my son is home (whichis only for a few more days) but then I don't know how I'll do.
He won't be able to drive for some time and although I can drive around town o.k.
-- I only feel comfortable going out in the early morning hours.
It is harder for me to do things when streets and stores become busy so I rely on him for that alot.
I get panic attacks thinking about having to deal with all of this.
I don't mind taking care of him -- but I worry that I can't do it.
I guess we'll have to see how things progress.
He goes to the doctor on Tuesday and we'll see when his surgery is scheduled.Happy New Year to everyone.

If you have been following my posts you know that I love to ice skate.
Living in the south that is difficult to do.....there just are not that many rinks around.
There are some in Atlanta so I asked my son if he would go ice skating with me when he came home for Christmas break.
So, we went this morning.
My husband, my son and I went to meet Alan's girlfriend and her family who were going to skate with us as well.About 20 minutes into the ice skating session my husband fell on the ice.
He said he hurt his elbow and we got off the ice to see if he could bend it, if it was bleeding, etc.
It seemed as if he might have bruised it a good bit.
After a few minutes he said he wanted to go to the hospital and have it checked out.
Mind you, my husband doesn't go to the doctor very freely -- so I figured it must have been hurting more than he let on -- he has a relative high threshold for pain.
So, we drove back to Athens (about 45 minutes) to go to our local hospital.
After xrays, it was determined that he broke his elbow.
Surgery now awaits him next week.Many of you reading this may know that many years ago he fell off of a ladder and broke his elbow on his left arm and his wrist on his right arm, both requiring surgery.
After casts were applied, there were no hands available to do the minor things in life and it was a little difficult for awhile.
This time he broke his right elbow and although he is right handed, at least he has a hand free this time -- and that will make life a little easier.You always have to find that bright spot!

As we head toward Christmas it seems as if there are always a lot of loose ends to tie up.
But I guess that is the way this goes isn't it.
It's a little harder for me to get to some of those things but I keep plugging away at it.My son gets home this week and I am going to see if I can get him to give this page a new look.
After several years it needs a face lift.I worry about a lot of things these days.
And I am worried about those climbers out in Oregon.
I don't know them but I am so worried about them --one has been found dead and I fear for the others.
I can't imagine what their families must be going through.
I'm almost obsessed about it -- wanting to check the news all the time to see if they have been found.I got to ice skating this past weekend in Savannah.
There were way too many kids on the ice and it was extremely loud so of course that was a problem, but at least I got to skate.
I hope that when Alan is home I will get to skate again.
Lots of friends to see this week.
That is a good thing.
Fortunately these are people that I get to see all the time.
I feel good about that -- that these are "fair weathered" friends if you will.
It's nice to have these people in my life.
I wish some of my friends in Illinois were closer as well as my family so I could see them more often.
I know they know that they stay in my thoughts all the time.I know this post kind of went from topic to topic.
My mind is jumping around a lot today.
That's why it is titled "This and That".

<doc date=Thursday, December 14, 2006>
Well, it is just a few short weeks until Christmas.
Although everything is decked out for Christmas, it doesn't seem like Christmas to me.
That is probably because it is so warm here.
It gets cold here in the south occasionally but it doesn't stay cold.
But it is suppose to be 70 degrees here today.
And, through next week in the 60's.
I'm going to Savannah tomorrow for a couple of days and it will be even warmer there.
Hopefully, by the time the 25th rolls around it will be at least in the 50's?
Here's hoping.Plus, it really won't feel like Christmas until our son comes home.
That will be next week and then maybe it will help liven up the season.

The story is to be on Early On-Set Alzheimer's.
I'm so pleased for all this media attention.
Help me again by thanking the media for the coverage.
There was also a story last night about Alzheimer's disease in general.
CBS' email address is http://www.cbsnews.com/htdocs/feedback/fb_news_form.shtml.

Please catch it if you can and let NBC news know that you appreciate their coverage.
They can be emailed at nightly@nbc.com.
CBS is also working on some coverage of this as well.
The National office of the Alzheimer's Assn.
in Chicago has been behind all this publicity and it is great.
The more we get the word out, the better the understanding of the disease and the bigger push to find a cure.

Every year we say that we can't believe it is time for Christmas again.....but come it does.
I am one of these people that shop all year round, but now I forget what I buy so it makes it harder!
I've started keeping lists, but then I forget to put things down on my list!
But, in the end, I don't think anyone will be forgotten and if they are, they will certainly understand.I'm anxious for my son to be home.
He's coming in later than usual this year, and it will seem as if Christmas is a bit rushed.
However, he is staying until after the first of the year so we will still be able to have time together.
That time becomes more and more valuable to me.The shopping crowds are a bit too much for me, so it is a good thing I do shopping throughout the year.
Panic attacks set in rather quickly these days and all those people are just a little overwhelming for me.The cold has gripped the South today and will be with us for a few days.
Being a native midwesterner I miss the cold and snow sometimes.
Having 60 and 70 degree weather in the winter just doesn't seem right.

It's gift giving season and it's hard to know what to buy some of my friends and family.
I know some of my family members are having a hard time buying things for me......but when it comes right down to it.....I don't need anything.
If I want something I usually go and buy it.
I say I don't need anything, but then I do.
I need time.
I don't know if "time" is considered a "thing" or not, but just the same I need time.Time to spend with my family.
Time to spend with my friends.
I realize how precious that time is as my disease progresses and that is what is so valuable to me.
When we are babies time is inconsequential.When we are children, time doesn't seem to go by fast enough.When we are teens, it seems like forever before you turn 16 and get your driver's license.Then it is an eternity waiting until you turn 21.After that, those big birthdays that end in "0" come all too quickly.Suddenly, you turn around and wonder where all the time has gone.Time, spend it wisely.
You never know when you are going to run out.

Well, Thanksgiving is over.
We had a nice dinner with friends and it was very relaxing.
It's always nice to eat someone else's cooking for a change.
But, I've eaten way too much and have to get back on the wagon so to speak.
I'm trying not to gain too much weight this holiday season.Shopping is becoming much more difficult with the crowds.
I have panic attacks so bad with large crowds that I really need someone to go shopping with me.
It is funny because I can go to a large sporting event and it not bother me as much, but I think it is because for the most part people are sitting down and not milling around.
Being the midst of a large crowd going every direction scares me and I need someone with me.
I guess it is a good thing I can buy things over the internet.
It is much less daunting to me.My nephew in Illinois got engaged over the holiday weekend.
He and his girlfriend were on a trip to Ireland and he proposed "across the pond" if you will.
I haven't heard all the details yet and I haven't met his intended but I'm really happy for him.
I hope everyone had a good holiday.
More to follow.

<doc date=Wednesday, November 22, 2006>
to everyone.
I appreciate all your support this year and am thankful to call you my friends.
As we all think about the holiday gift giving season, we all need to remember that friends and family and the some of the best presents we could get.
And sharing time with those friends and family is a better present.

Before I retired, I was the director of a performing arts theatre.
It was very stressful and I worked long hours.
I had to deal with agents, promoters, tour managers, tour accountants, groupies, roadies and of course the talent itself.
Sometimes working with these people was fun, sometimes it was a nightmare!
But sometimes the most interesting people I dealt with were the fans themselves.
I really came to understand the word "fan" as being "fanatical".
There were all kinds -- good, bad, weird, obsessive, good natured and fun.
I could go on and on about the fans I have met over the years.
When Bob Dylan came to play at our venue the fans were extremely strange.
We had lots of gifts, flowers, letters, etc.
that were sent to the venue to give to Mr. Dylan.
The rock groups had their groupies.
We had to do a lot of homework when an act booked with us to see what the fans were like and what we had to expect during the days and nights leading up to the show.Which brings me to "Thelma and Louise".
Back in 1997 we booked Kenny Rogers for one of his Christmas Shows.
I received a phone call from two ladies that live in Stone Mountain Georgia.
They told me what big Kenny Rogers fans they were and wanted to come over to the look at the theatre so they could "pick out their seats".
Our venue was relatively new at that point so many people were not familiar with the layout of the theatre.
My first thought at the time when I was talking to them was, "I just don't have time to show two women the theatre so they can "pick out their seats".
Besides many of our seats were pre-sold to season ticket holders and these women didn't have a chance of being able to "pick out their seats", because the ones that they wanted would probably already have been sold.
But after talking to them for awhile, I relented and told them to come over.
They lived a little over an hour away and we made an appointment for them to come visit me.When they arrived, they turned out to be more than a typical fan -- these ladies in their late 40's early 50's were true fanatics.
They are sisters and they told me that they had been to over 500 of Kenny Rogers' concerts.
They were also going to be buying close to 100 tickets (or more) because they had so many people from Stone Mountain that wanted to come with them that they needed to accommodate them.
They were renting buses and making this a grand affair.
They also wanted to feed these people in one of the banquet rooms adjacent to the theatre.
At the time, Kenny Rogers had a chicken franchise called Kenny Rogers Roasters.
There was one in Athens and the women wanted them to cater this dinner prior to the concert.
So, what turned out to be a meeting with these two women to "pick out their seats", became a big sale and a catered dinner.
On top of that, TNN, The Nashville Network, called me to tell me they were doing a piece on these two for one of their shows and wanted to come to the center and video tape them at dinner and at the concert.
So, we got a little press out of it as well.I really enjoyed meeting them and their zest for life.
Their enthusiasm for Kenny was a  little over the top to me, but that is what being a fan is all about, right?
Needless to say, while making all the arrangements for this trip, the ladies and I became fast friends.
I really enjoyed working with them and they always made me laugh.
But they had this passion that I had not seen in anyone for a long time.
I started calling them "Thelma and Louise" -- just because of their zest for life.
The funny part was that they didn't know who "Thelma and Louise" were.
So, they went and rented the movie.
They called me in horror after watching the movie and said -- "But Kris, we didn't kill anyone!".
We all had a laugh and they have been forever, Thelma and Louise.
Now they fight over who is Thelma and who is Louise.All of this took place about ten years ago and these two women have stayed in my life.
I've gone to two Kenny Rogers' concerts with them, met them in Las Vegas when they were there seeing Kenny and continued to keep up with many of their trips.
I could go on and on about them and you would laugh along with me -- they are so great.
To date, they have seen 963 of Kenny's concerts and expect to be at 1,000 by next summer.
And yes, they both have jobs, so arranging all the travel and tickets, etc.
for each of the concerts is a lot more work for them.Their mother had dementia so when I was going through my diagnosis, Thelma and Louise were right there for me.
And, continue to be.
Today, my husband and I are driving over to have lunch with them.
I haven't seen them in quite awhile but we keep up with each other.
You never know who is going to play an important part in your life.
Thelma and Louise will always be in my heart.

We made it home from California last night.
It was a short trip but it was nice to visit Alan and his girlfriend Jennifer.
I don't travel as well as I used to but I have this week to rest up.
We had great weather while we there.One day we went into San Francisco and it was a holdiay -- Veteran's day -- so there were many more people in the crowded shopping area and park we were at than normally would be for that particular day.
The schools were out so there were lots of kids in the shopping mall areas.
We went to a new place in town that just opened up and it is an entertainment/shopping district that had an ice skating rink.
You all know how I like to ice skate!
But, there were way too many kids on the rink for me to feel comfortable -- if it had been an average day I would have been out there in no time flat.
But, it wasn't to be.
I don't usually miss an opportunity to ice skate.
Being in large crowds is hard for me and I need to be sure that I stay close to whoever is with me.
Panic attacks usually hit me in these types of situations, but I got away with not having one.
I was glad to get back to the hotel though that night.More soon after I have rested.
The photo at top is of us at a winery in Napa Valley.
Alan's girlfriend, Jennifer Lee is in the photo with us.

We are off to California to see Alan tomorrow.
He was going to come home for Thanksgiving but airfares and schedules didn't work to his advantage.
So I'll blog when I get back.Here's a photo of my team from Memory Walk.
I'm real proud of them!
We raised over $7,000 and the total for the Walk is over $62,000 and we are still counting.

<doc date=Sunday, November 05, 2006>
to all who walked in the Memory Walk yesterday.
It was a great success.
Weather was great, lots of people and we exceeded our $50,000 goal.
Thanks too to Barbara for her wonderful comment she left on this blog.
What a great idea to bound your letters for you and your husband.
I know that project gave you as much joy as it has me.I'm tired from the walk.
More soon

Our Memory Walk is tomorrow.
This year I have taken a much less active role because I knew that I couldn't do what I used to be able to do.
It is way too much stress for me now -- I think I am finally learning my limitations although I don't always listen to myself!
But I knew that it was time for someone else to take over the reigns of the Memory Walk.
And, the lady that we have had chair our walk this year was outstanding.
She has worked tirelessly for the cause and she is really to be commended.
I appreciate all the things she is doing so much, I can't express it enough.
It's a big job to do and she has totally embraced it.
Thank you -- Eve -- for all you have done.
Hopefully, I can post some photos after tomorrow's walk.
Thanks to all that donated.
We will definitely reach our goal for this year's walk of $50,000.

I think my husband and I have become officially "old" people.
The reason I say that is it that every day it seems we are saying "remember when".
Whether it is something my son used to do as a child, what we did in college or as children we are bringing up the past.
Yesterday I was telling someone how in college we used to go "Trick or Drinking" on Halloween.
That was certainly a long time ago!
But, at least I can still remember a lot of these things -- recent things, not so much.One thing I enjoy doing every year that hopefully will bring back memories for my son, is my annual letter I write to him.
Every year on his birthday (his birthday was a few weeks ago) I write him a letter.
I started this on the day that he was born.
For some reason in the hospital I this desire to write him a letter to let him know what I was feeling that day.
I don't know why but the urge was so strong I just had to do it.
I wasn't sure at the time what I was going to do with the letter but I wrote it and tucked it away in my things when I went home from the hospital.
A few weeks after he was born I found it and re-read.
I sealed it in an envelope and thought I would put it in his baby book.On his first birthday the thought occured to me to write him another letter, so I did.
I sealed this one up and put it with the other one.
Then I realized that this would become my tradition, each year I would write my son a letter on his birthday.
My thought at the time was that when he turned 21 I would give them all to him.
Each year, I look forward to writing that letter come October.
I write things down over the year that I want to include in it, gather some photos from the year and any newspaper clippings or whatever I might want to include.
They don't always make it to the final letter but I enjoy collecting these items as the year goes on.
When he was smaller, I used to write all of his milestones down and tell him what I thought his future would hold for him.
This experience is really an emotional one for me because I usually pour my heart out and tell it like it is.
As he has gotten older, I chronicle his accomplishments -- but of course he will remember those on his own, but I want him to know how he makes me feel.
Since my Alzheimer's diagnosis these letters have become much more important to me.
Although I started scrapbooking after my diagnosis to help me remember as well as share what I could with my family through photos, these letters will hopefully mean much more to my son later on.He's 23 now and there are 22 letters waiting for him.
I skipped a year and there is a reason but I won't go into that.
Obviously, I didn't give the letters to my son when he was 21.
I'm not sure when he will get them -- my first thought is upon my death.
But when my disease gets to the stage where I can no longer remember him, perhaps that will be the time he can read them -- while I'm still with him, but not at the same time.

We are a week away from out Memory Walk here in Athens.
It is a little later than usual but that is because of the UGA Football schedule.
We have to work around football -- we either have to do it on an away weekend or an off weekend so November 4th was picked.
Georgia plays Kentucky in Kentucky that day.
But, because all groups have to work around the UGA football schedule, there are lots of events that happen on the same weekends.
We have stiff competition from the Heart Walk that weekend.Anyway, there is still time to donate.
My personal goal is $3,500.00 -- and I'm close -- just need a little help from my friends.
You can donate online by clicking here and following the prompts.......https://www.kintera.org/faf/donorReg/donorPledge.asp?ievent=160213&lis=1&kntae160213;=DEB6C0D2006F40EEB471A6DB11D8D104&supId=9079347

I have had the hardest time coming up with words lately.
Usually this happens when I get tired but yesterday I couldn't think of the right words for things most of the day.
When I get stuck, my husband will ask me "what does it do?"
"what do you use it for?"
or "what does it look like?"
-- which doesn't help at all -- it just makes me more frustrated.
I was on the phone last night with my son and couldn't remember some words and it is even harder for me when I am on the phone because I know the person can't see me struggling to find the words.
A lot of times, I just have to quit talking and come back later to it -- if I remember!

I know I have written here before about how frustrating it is for me to play tennis these days.
I lack the concentration for it.
And, tennis is probably about the only thing in life I have ever had a true passion for.
Yesterday, one of our Memory Walk teams in Athens held a tennis tournament to raise funds for the walk.
Of course, I had to sign up and my husband I played in it.
Of course we didn't win -- but my frustration with it was very upsetting to me.
First of all I forgot my earplugs.
The noise from the surrounding courts bothers me and to make matters worse, we played at a local high school and their football team came out to practice just at the same time we started to play.
So not only did I have to deal with the tennis court noise, I had the students making noise and the coaches whistles blowing all the time.
And, I think that my frustration came from not the fact that I couldn't play well, but that the reality struck me that I probably shouldn't play at all.
Giving up something like tennis for me is difficult.Another frustrating thing is that my oldest brother is not well.
He has diabetes and we think the start of Parkinsons.
He won't seek medical attention in spite of our best efforts.
He obviously has a death wish -- or so it would seem.
We all feel very helpless.
I feel even more helpless living so far away.
He won't listen to his family.
We know he is depressed and it hurts us deeply that he won't see a doctor about the things that he can do something about -- his depression and his diabetes.
He was diagnosed with diabetes a couple of years ago and refuses to take medicine or watch his diet.
His eyes and his feet are in bad shape and it is a shame to see him do this to himself.
How frustrating.

My husband and I just returned from our first "seniors" trip.
It was to the Greenbrier Resort in West Virginia.
It was just beautiful.
I have always wanted to go there and knew that we could never afford to go on our own.
So when some friends suggested it I jumped on the chance.The fall colors were at their peak in some areas and it was just breathtaking.I did o.k.
-- got tired earlier than I should have.
I ate too much, didn't sleep enough so I got off my routine.
But all I had to do was to follow people around all the time, so I did o.k.
It's was so nice to have it all arranged for us.
When we go on vacation we probably argue more about where we are going to eat than anything else.
In a few weeks we are planning a trip to see the kid in California.
He was coming home for Thanksgiving put the airfare and scheduling didn't work.
So we will have our Thanksgiving early I guess.Since I'm pretty tired I am going to stop for now and more soon.

Yesterday, I went to a funeral in a Catholic Church.
I wasn't raised Catholic and I always feel awkward when I go to a service in the Catholic Church because I don't know what to do and to say at the appropriate times.
My husband was raised as a Catholic but gave it up long ago.
I was raised as a Christian Scientist and gave that up long ago.
But one thing I realized when I was at the mass yesterday was that I miss going to church.
I also realized how much I missed singing the hymns.After our son was born, I asked my husband if we could shop around for churches as I thought it was important to bring Alan up with some understanding of the religious world -- if for no other reason than for him to be able to decide for himself later on what was right for him.
I wanted us to go to church as a family and be a part of a church.
But for various reasons, we couldn't agree on a church and that hope of mine was not fulfilled.
However, I found a church that I enjoyed attending and did so for awhile by myself.
But the problem I found was that in the south you don't just "go to church".
Church becomes you.
When I would go to this church I would see people that I knew and they were constantly asking me to "come to Sunday School", "come to my Bible Study group", "come to a church dinner", etc., etc.
I didn't want to do all that stuff -- I just wanted to go to church on Sunday morning and listen to the service.
When I explained that to my well meaning friends I think they understood and they let up for awhile but then they were back at it again.
I felt bad always having to say no and as a result I stopped going to that church.
It was the same with some other churches that I attended briefly.I'm not a deeply religious person but I do believe in certain things.
If you live in the south and don't belong to a church you are certainly an outsider.Switching topics -- Since being diagnosed I have become aware that I am much more emotional now than I have ever been.
The littlest things can bring me to tears.
I have attended several funerals lately and although I didn't know the deceased very well (knew their spouses better) I was overwhelmed by my emotion.
Things on tv get me stirred up to.
Perhaps it is at those times that I realize how much we take life for granted and we shouldn't.
I thought I had come to realize that -- but it is probably a good reminder.

My birthday was yesterday -- and amazingly -- I didn't wake up to a Red Miata sitting in the driveway.......or a new screened in back porch......or tickets for me and my family to go to Australia.
Go figure.
But I did get lots of calls and emails from friends and relatives.
And, of course, Alan was home for the weekend and that is the best present of all.
I cherish time with friends and family so much these days.
But now I'm tired....just a little gets me off my routine and I haven't had a nap in two days.
I know that sounds like something little to most people, but I have such bad days when I'm tired.
I really need to do better about those naps.
I certainly notice a big difference in not only my reaction time to things, but memory and lack of concentration.
It's days like this that you do stupid things and then it makes you feel stupid.
It is sometimes hard to distinguish the two -- that you really aren't stupid, you just do stupid things sometimes.

For those of you suffering with Early On-Set Alzheimer's or are caring for someone with it, there is a new message board on the National Alzheimer's Assn.
website for us.
You can access it by going to www.alz.org.
We all need to stick together and this will help all of us.
Thanks to the Association for doing this.

I have lots of "thank you's" for this week.Thanks to all of you for responding to my "Call For Action" last week as stated below.
I really appreciate it.
Thanks to the Georgia Alzheimer's Assn.
for the special greeting they sent me last week.
These folks are a great group of people.Thanks to all that have contributed to the Memory Walk this year.
But if you haven't, there is still time -- you can click to the left of this blog and find a link.
Thanks too, for all your comments that all of you have left on my blog.
Many do not get published for everyone to see for various reasons, but I see them all and they are very inspiring to me.
I'll save the rest of my "thank you's" for a time around Thanksgiving!On a few other notes, I would like to say that the interview with our family that was done as part of a series for CNN is scheduled to run this Friday, October 6th.
It will run in Headline News and is schedule to run once an hour from the 1:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m.
The Healthy Minute segment usually runs about 8 minutes after the hour.
There will be four Healthy Minute segments dealing with Alzheimer's in all and the other one that has my family in it will run on November 6th.
I'll be encouraging you all to contact CNN after they run as I did with the NBC piece.The National Alzheimer's office asked me to come to Washington to speak at a meeting that would include the FDA and some of the pharmaceutical companies.
Alzheimer's drugs was the topic.
I had to decline the invitation because of a trip we have scheduled to California to see Alan and it is also just a couple of days after the memory walk.
I really hate it when I have to turn down a request like that because it is so important to me.
I feel like I have let them down by not being able to do this, but my stamina isn't what it used to be.
When I'm tired my brain doesn't work right and it gets to be too much for me.
I appreciate them asking me and I know they will find someone else to do this, but I am disappointed I can't do it.
It's always been hard for me to say "no" to things, but I think I am finally realizing my new limitations and I don't like it so much.

OK everyone, I'm asking you for a favor.
Yesterday, the Today Show on NBC ran a story about Alzheimer's.
The main message was the current research and where we stand on a cure, early detection and current drugs on the market.
If you didn't see the piece here is the link http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3032633/?ta=y .
Hopefully, that will work.
If not, go to www.MSNBC.com and click on the Today Show.What I would like to ask of you is to email NBC and thank them for running the piece.
It doesn't cost you anything and it just takes a few minutes.
We need more stories about Alzheimer's running on the airwaves and if people take just a minute to let the news organizations know that we want more info out there it will help.
The address is Today@nbc.com.
During the month of October CNN is going to be running four one minute segments on Alzheimer's during the Headline News.
They are the "Healthy minute".
My family and I are featured in one or two of them as well as some the experts in the field of Alzheimer's research.
This started out being only one "one minute" segment, but because the information was so good they are doing four different segments.
Yes, it is only one minute -- but it is CNN.
The segment will be broadcast several times during the day.
The first one is scheduled to air on October 6th.
I will let you know when the others are going to air.
But, I'll be asking you to do the same -- after they air to email CNN and thank them for the coverage.I would appreciate everyone helping me do this.
We can all make a difference.
Thanks!

I've always enjoyed sports.
Growing up there were not too many opportunities for me to play competitive sports because Title IX wasn't in effect back then -- guess that shows my age!
But, I'm not sure if I would have done it even if it were.
I enjoyed the "backyard sports" as well as tennis and golf.
Having two brothers around the house who devoured sports and statistics as well as having rivalries between their professional sports teams, sports always seemed to be a part of my life.Nowadays, I enjoy watching sports on tv and of course the weekends give me many opportunities to watch a number of sports.
I find it is more difficult to keep up with them these days -- I'm glad most of the stations keep the score on the screen all the time, because sometimes it is hard for me to remember who is winning.
Plus, I'm kind of bad about switching to different channels to watch different games so it is harder to keep up.
But at least I can still enjoy them.
Attending large sporting activities has also become more of a problem.
All the noise, the crowds get me confused.
I wouldn't go it alone these days that is for sure.

I always have a hard time come up with titles for my blogs.
I always want to be cute and clever, but I don't seem to be as cute and clever as I used to be!
I get so frustrated some times because I can't think fast enough -- there have been many times (especially when I was still working) that someone would say something and I had a great line to come back with.
Even though I have longer to think about a title every time I write -- I still can't think of much.
That is why today I'm leaving it blank.I've been pretty lazy since coming back from the conference last week.
I think I'm still somewhat tired.
We were going to drive to St. Louis this weekend for my husband's niece's wedding, but for various reasons we aren't.
I'm glad we didn't -- not sure I was up to that and all the things that go along with a wedding right now.
Yesterday my husband took me to the grocery store.
As many of you know, I have a problem with his driving.
Around town it isn't as bad as when we go to Atlanta or a different city.
Yesterday, I got really anxious when we went to the grocery store because he didn't park in the same area that I normally park in.
I know this sounds silly to any of you reading this, but I lose all sense of where I am at, what I am doing and become confused.
If he is with me I am better, but that whole routine thing kicks in -- like I have to go the same direction in the store or go to familiar stores to shop.
This part of me is getting much worse.
But, I'm still going to try to do as much of the shopping as I'm still able to do.
I don't want to give that up just yet.

The Dementia Care Conference was great.
A little overwhelming, but great.
I've worked with three people for the last eight or nine months -- Dr. Scott Roberts from the University of Michigan, Michelle Barclay with the Alzheimer's Association in Los Angeles, CA and Kristy Klein with the National Alzheimer's Office in Chicago.
It was nice to finally meet Scott and Michelle and to see Kristy again.
They were all wonderful to work with and helped me along in the process.Although the conference was geared to professionals in the field of Dementia Care I learned more than I thought I would.
A lot of emphasis was given to early stage dementia and those attended seemed to want to know more.
It's just a baby step in this disease.But it was exhausting.
It has taken me a couple of days to feel my feet under me again.
The day I came home from Atlanta it was pouring down rain and the fog was awful.
It took me two and half hours to get home (normally it takes one and half hours) and I was white knuckle driving the whole time.
When I got home I felt wasted.
I was tired and pretty non-communicative to my husband.
Yesterday wasn't much better -- I felt like I was in a comatose state most of the day.
Needless to say these last two days have not been "good days" for me.
I stayed in Atlanta for three nights.
The conference was at the Westin and it was so nice that when I was feeling tired I could go up to my hotel room and retreat to the quietness of it.
Coming home on Wednesday I actually felt annoyed that there was someone else in the house (my husband) and he was invading my "silence time".
It was so hard to come home to "noise".
I got to the point where I was feeling mad at my husband and it wasn't his fault.
Those of you that know my husband know how quiet it is.
It was just that I had gotten used to the sereneness of my room and no distractions.
When I got home the noise of the television, the sound of my husband's voice and even the meow of my cats was getting on my nerves and making me very agitated.
I finally had to seek some quiet time in another part of the house, and then rested as well.
This seems like such a silly thing, but it is so upsetting to me.
I'm getting used to the noise around the house again.
I'm glad I don't have a lot of kids around or dogs barking all the time!Well, I have rambled on enough for now.
More soon.

I hope everyone got to rest up a little on this holiday.
Our day was filled.
CNN came to do an interview with my husband and me for their "Healthy Minute" segment.
It stems from the National Conference that I have been working on for the National Alzheimer's Association.
The conference is next week in Atlanta and many professionals in the field of Alzheimer's will be there to share their work, their research and their experiences.
CNN will be talking with some of the doctors there as well.
Early On-Set Alzheirmer's caught their eye and that is what the piece will be about.
Judy Fortin is the reporter.
I'll let you know when it airs and I would encourage everyone to email them after it is over to support their exposure to the disease.
We need more of this!
Tomorrow I am heading over to Atlanta to shoot some Public Service Announcements for this year's memory walk.
The walks are starting all over the country this month and will go through November.
I know I have discussed them here before, but, if you are reading this, you have some interest in Alzheimer's.
I'd like to encourage you to walk or donate to the cause.
More information can be found by clicking on one of the references to the left of this post.
OK -- I'm done with all of that for now.I think I have rested since the trip, but already with things going on this week it is overwhelming.
The conference is next week and then perhaps I'll be able to get back to my routine.
My panic attacks continue to be bad -- but I have put myself in situations that make them worse.
Fortunately, I've had someone with me most of the time, and it doesn't seem to be as frightening when someone is there.
I have to be better about not getting myself into these situations.My son starts his second year of law school tomorrow.
In about 4.5 months he'll be able to say he's half through!
He was fortunate to make the Stanford Law Review so he will be kept busy by that this year as well as his school work.On another note -- I recently read an article on Michael J.
Fox and his struggles with Parkinson's Disease.
I have read many, but this one was especially poignant to me.
I so admire what he is doing and speaking out on behalf of himself and others with the disease.
He has been able to reach so many people with his message and raise quite a bit of money for his cause.
I certanily wish him well as his Parkinson's progresses.

We made it back from Seattle late last night.
We are exhausted.
But, we had a good time.
It is always great to spend some time with my son.
He drove up from Mountain View California so he was our "driver" all week.
However, I have decided that if he doesn't make it as a lawyer he could certainly be a taxi cab driver in New York City.....he drives like one!The photos above are from Mt.
Ranier.
It was so beautiful.
The weather was great that day so we were able to see the full view of the mountain.
As we got ready to leave the clouds started rolling in.
It was nice to get away but it is getting more difficult to travel.
I really get tired and I try to "stay up" with the group but that doesn't always happen.
One day I just had to let my husband and son go out and do things on their own because I wasn't up to it.
I had a few panic attacks and it just becomes overwhelming.
I feel like I am the ball in the ball in chain when we go out because I'm usually the one holding everyone up.It will take me a few days to get back into my routine and I certainly missed it.
I'm much more comfortable at home now.More after I rest up.

<doc date=Tuesday, August 22, 2006>
in the morning for Seattle.
I promised to blog before I left.
I had planned to write a lot but our computer has been down and it is late so this is going to be short.
I'm very anxious about the trip.
I've had panic attacks all day and couldn't do the simplest of things!
It is so frustrating.
I hope I will be better when I am there.
I know I'll be all right because I have my family with me --that's a good thing.
More when I return.

I've been bothered a great deal by panic attacks this week.
They seem to come and go.
And, I haven't seen a pattern for them this week at all.
But, they do stop me in my tracks and the only place I feel comfortable is at home.I've been trying to stay to my routine as much as possible.
One day this week, though, it was time for me to go to the gym and the panic attack was so bad I had to stay home.
Luckily, I know I am not going to die from them, but they are certainly annoying.Perhaps I am getting a little anxious about a trip we are taking next week.
We are headed out to Seattle to catch up with my son.
He is driving up to Seattle from Stanford and we are going to have a week together.
I don't do well traveling these days and perhaps that is in the back of my mind.
More before I leave --I promise.

I had a strenuous "mind week" if you will.
Was working on a lot of things for the Memory walk and I also decided to tackle a jigsaw puzzle.
If you've read my posts before you know that I say never to give a jigsaw puzzle to an Alzheimer's patient (at least me) because it is so frustrating.
But, I felt pretty good and I had one in the closet and I decided to try it.
Talk about a brain drain!
But I did finish it and I was totally exhausted.
I couldn't believe how much it took out of me.
After finishing it up on Thursday, I went to a Memory Walk meeting with my husband.
It was at a restaurant that was very noisy.
I could barely get through the meeting and meal because of the noise and just being mentally tired.
I kept forgetting what I was saying, was confused and just normally not doing very well.
I'm glad my husband was with me because I'm not sure I would done very well getting home.
That night I had a dream and in it I had Alzheimer's.
Alzheimer's has never manifested itself into my dreams.
I thought it was interesting that that night it did.
I've always been this "normal" person in my dreams.
I hope that doesn't keep reoccuring because it is nice to know that when I go to sleep and dream I don't have this.

Over the last few days I have come across several people who are dealing with denial issues in regards to Alzheimer's.
Some are dealing with denial over themselves having the disease while others are dealing with denial from their family members.I can understand the denial from the person with Alzheimer's much more than I can with the family.
Now I realize that there is always some sort of denial in the beginning, but when it is taken to the extent of denial in not helping the person with Alzheimer's because they don't believe they have the disease -- that is a little harder to take.My family has said that I never went into denial.
I think I probably did, but if I did it wasn't for long.
What is the point?
If you have a disease what is the reason for denial?
Deal with it.
Find out what you can do and live the rest of the life you have.
We always say life is too short and when you are in denial it is even shorter, because you are not enjoying the time you have with your friends and family.
Besides, it takes too much effort (for me anyway) to be in denial.It's hard to ask for help when you are in denial -- and trust me -- with Alzheimer's you need help.
I don't like to admit that I do, but as each day, week and month passes I need more help.
I don't like it -- but I'm learning to deal with it.

I know it is hot all over the country and I don't know if that is the reason I have been so "out of it" lately or not.
I just haven't felt like doing anything lately (including writing in this blog).
I feel lethargic and lazy.
I know that everyone wants to blame the weather on everything , but because I can't think of any other excuse, that's what I'm going to do too!

<doc date=Wednesday, July 26, 2006>
As I get to know more and more people with Alzheimer's I find there are more and more blogs cropping up out there.
I'm glad that is the case -- those of us that can speak about the disease need to.
The latest one I found was a gentleman named Don Hayen.
His blog can be found here http://thetripover.com.
I've asked my son to put a link to it on this page so you can refer to it later if you would like.
Don was recently diagnosed and shares some of his trials and tribulations.
I've noticed that since he is just starting this blog that some of his observations are the same as mine have been -- he's just putting it into different words.
And, the longer I write this I realized that you always don't want to hear about my problems with Alzheimer's -- I don't like tothink of them myself sometimes.
So, I haven't been speaking of them as much as of late.
But I'll get back there -- I need to -- because so much more needs to be said.In reading Don's blog though, I find it interesting at some of the comments.
One lady wrote about a relative that could figure certain things out but not others.
She said something like it was interesting he could open up some files in his brain for some things and not for others.
That is so true.....I'm always amazed at how I know how to do things but I can't do them.
Like I know what has to be done, but I can't put the actions into an order to make it happen.
Like getting a meal together sometimes.
I know exactly what needs to be done, but I can't get there.
Our brains are interesting parts of our body!!

Over the last few days we have had some visitors.
My great niece visited for a day and my friends Pody and Rick from Illinois.
It was great to have them here.But now I am ready to get back to "normal" if there is such a thing anymore.
All of our company for the summer has come and gone and we don't really have much planned until we head out to Seattle to catch up with our son for a week's vacation.
I think I am ready for some down time.
I don't really realized until after the fact how tired I can get.
It takes me a lot longer to get back to my routine.
For a few days I will notice some problems with my Alzheimer's and have many more "Alzheimer's moments" but we have come to expect them and can live with them.
We always have little "surprises" but nothing we can't deal with.Lots of things are happening on the Alzheimer's research lately.
Some scientists in Australia claim they have found a "cure" .
The following is a quote from a recent article that was published in Ireland -- Scientists in Australia have developed a once-a-day pill, which they claim may cure Alzheimer's disease.
Human trials of the drug - PBT2 - are to begin next month.The breakthrough was made by a team at the Mental Health Research Institute of Victoria.
The drug stops the build-up of amyloid, a protein which is widely accepted to be a major cause of Alzheimer's.
"This is a major breakthrough.
Though much depends on the next phase of human clinical trials...early results indicate this drug offers hope to people with Alzheimer's disease", said Prof George Fink, director of the institute.Early clinical tests involving animals indicate that the drug is fast-acting and is capable of suppressing the impairment of memory function that arises as a result of the disease.According to Prof Fink, PBT2 could prevent Alzheimer's from developing or delay the onset of the disease for many years.He added that pending further trials, the drug could be on the market within four years.Wouldn't this be a great thing?

Many of you probably know that President Bush is set to veto the recent bill about Stem Cell Research.
It will be his first veto of his administration.
I know we all have our thoughts about this, but my view is that we need it.
Not only to help with Alzheimer's but a host of diseases.
I'm disappointed in his decision.It's hot here in the south as it is all over the country.
It's kind of hard to get motivated to do much.
We have company coming in a few days.
First my great niece who is ten years old.
She is down this way visiting her father and we will catch up with her over the weekend.
Then my dear friends Pody and Rick from Champaign IL will be here for a day.
These fine folks are the ones we went to visit last year in England.
We have such fond memories of the trip -- it just seems like yesterday we were there.Healthwise, I haven't had the best of days lately.
I try to get through them one day at a time.

As I was thinking about what to write, I thought of several titles, but then when it came to actual type it, I couldn't figure out which one to use.
So, that is why the title is what it is.As my post below indicates, I have been dealing with some other stuff lately.
Mainly that has been somewhat of a different kind of health scare -- it isn't over yet, but I am trying to remain optimistic about it.
The first few days I was dealing with this the stress that it was causing me was making my Alzheimer's much worse and I realized I needed to do something to try not to worry so much.
It was hard, but I tried to find other things to occupy my racing mind.
I am also upset that my son hasn't taken this recent development very seriously.
That's quite uncharacterstic of him.
But that is a whole different issue.I was able to get away for a day or two though and went to South Carolina to play golf and just relax.
It is definitely what I needed to help clear my head a little.
And, my brother is visiting from Illinois -- he is here because his work brought him through this part of the country and although his visit is short, it makes me feel better.In a week or so my friends from Illinois that were living in England in the fall will be visiting.
It will be nice to see them as well.
That's a great things about family and friends --they can certainly give you a boost when you need it the most.

I've been a little too pre-occupied with some other things going on in my life right now to post.
So, I promise that new posts will be on the way shortly.

<doc date=Wednesday, July 05, 2006>
It's been so hot here that we haven't been doing much.
I have finally recuperated from having my brother in law here -- or at least I think so.
Still haven't really gotten back into my routine.
We are having some work done on the house this week, but before they could come to work on it my husband has had to do some maintenance of his own on the house.
So, he has been outside working in 100 degree heat trying to get the house ready for some new guttering.
It always takes him longer than he thinks it is going to, so he spent a lot of time out in the heat.We did manage to play golf last week even though it was pretty hot.
My concentration level is getting so bad -- after about the fourth hole I should probably just call it quits and just walk the rest of the course without playing.
It's frustrating.Hope everyone had a great Fourth of July.
</doc>
<doc date=Wednesday, June 28, 2006>
My husband's brother just left after spending five days with us.
It has been 25 years since he has been to visit us.
It was nice having him here.
But, it was definitely hard -- havingsomeone else in the house.
I'm glad he came though -- it gave my husband someone else to play tennis and golf with.The weather has been awful down here -- lots of heat and humidity so you don't feel like doing much.
Unfortunately over the weekend and through the 4th of July weekend it will be more of the same.
I'm not planning on doing much.
It is going to take me awhile to get rested up from having company.
I didn't realize what a toll it would take on me.
On another note, I had a weird dream last night.
I hope it wasn't a premonition of some sort.
But I remember going around and telling everyone that they need to let everyone in their life know how important they are and how loved they are because life is just too short.
I was running around all over town telling people that -- kind of strange I know.
They all looked at me like I was crazy but I kep telling them that they would thank me for it later.
So, I guess I should take my own advice and thank all of you for your friendship and love -- maybe that's what dreams are for!

This morning I spoke to a local support group.
I've spoken to them in the past but what makes these folks different is that they are proactive.
By that I mean that many of the people are not in the support group because they are caring for someone with Alzheimer's, but most have had family members in the past with Alzheimer's and they just want to learn more about the disease.
I commend them for doing that.
Their group keeps getting larger and larger and I'm always so pleased to see them.
They always have great questions and I've said before, it does me more good I think than them.
I appreciate the opportunity to speak to them and any group.On another note, my brother-in-law is coming today for a five day visit.
We have lived here for 26 years and he came down a couple of months after we moved in and has never been back.
We visit him in St. Louis, but for various reasons he hasn't made it back down here.
He lost his wife to cancer at Christmas time.
I'm anxious for him to be here but at the same time hope he doesn't take it personally if I don't interact with him like I used to.
He isn't used to being around me and I definitely need my quiet time.
I told my husband to warn him that I wasn't been rude if I had to leave the room to "escape".
But, I'm glad he is coming -- it will do him good to get away for a few days.

I'm amazed at how much effort it takes for me to concentrate on something.
It's odd that the act of concentrating has become a conscious effort instead of something that comes automatically.
I am constantly having to remind myself what my tasks are and staying on task.
I've been trying to play some golf with my husband and after about four holes my concentration is gone as well as my game.......that's not saying I had a great game to begin with......but it certainly goes down hill after that.
I can't remember how many shots I've made (which might be a good thing!)
or even where I am aiming.
That's rather frustrating.

It's been awhile since I've had what I consider a "bad day".
But this week I did.
I usually don't go out much in the afternoon because I do better in the morning.
I had a doctor's appointment at 2:30 on Monday and I decided since I was going to be out I would try to run a couple of errands before going to the appointment.
Well, I should have thought about that before doing it.
Going out in the stores later in the day for me is not good.
There are just too many people and I get confused too much.
Needless to say I was very frustrated.
I needed to go about two miles from my last errand to the doctor and it took me over an hour to get there.
I was just so confused I couldn't make it from point A to point B in a rational way.
I called my husband several times for help, but he was not reachable by phone.
It is always odd that I know enough to call him for assistance but that I can't get to where I'm going.
Although, something that did change this time is, that I know that I can always call other people for assistance, but I couldn't do that on Monday.
That thought was not something that even entered my mind, until after the episode was over.When I finally arrived at the doctor's office (half an hour late) I had forms to fill out since I had not been to that particular doctor in awhile.
And, of course, that was a big challenge.
I had lots of blanks on the form because I just could not answer the simplest of questions.
It's so frustrating.I was glad to see Monday come to an end.

Yesterday, our Memory Walk Committee held their first meeting for Team Captains.
The turn out was great -- it is the third year we have done this and it was great to see how the event has grown.
I've been on the committee for two years but stepped away this year because it was a little much for me.
But I am so proud of what everyone has done, how the committee has expanded and all the things they have accomplished.
I feel bad I didn't do more -- but I know they are on the right track and I am so happy.
I really feel like we can meet our goal of raising $50,000 this year.
I also got a call from someone that had been at a recent meeting discussing clinical trials and some other things that have been doing on in the research field for Alzheimer's.
Although I don't want to get too excited because I have had my hopes dashed before, it appears there are now twelve different drugs in final clinical trial stages that have the potential to slow the progression of the disease down or prevent it all together --- wouldn't that be some wonderful news.
It's still a few years off but if I can hold out a little longer perhaps it can do me some good.
I'll certainly be keeping my eyes on that!

I don't know if you saw the news stories lately about Elizabeth Taylor having Alzheimer's.
Each week, I get news stories emailed to me by Google that have to do with Alzheimer's and last week there were many stories about Elizabeth Taylor having Early stage Alzheimer's.
These stories came from lots of newspapers, not just tabloids, but I don't know their sources.
Anyway, Ms. Taylor then went on Larry King Live and proclaimed that she did not have Alzheimer's.
Her interview probably did not affect you the way it did me but I was very upset with it.
She claimed on the show "do I look like I have Alzheimer's?
Do I look like I'm dying, do I sound like someone who has Alzheimer's?"
Just what is someone suppose to "look like" when they have Alzheimer's?
Ms. Taylor -- I don't "look like" I have Alzheimer's either -- but I do.
I'm not ashamed of it -- it's a disease and I have it.
Her attitude about this disease is what we must all fight -- people have to deal with it just like all other kinds of diseases.Can you see this bothered me?
I hope others are bothered by it as well.

As I write this my son is heading back to California.
It was nice to have him here for ten days.
I really miss him when he goes back.
We had a great time getting to play some golf and tennis.
Since my concentration is not that good anymore I'm not that much fun to play with, but he played with me and I at least enjoyed myself.Yesterday we went to a Braves game.
It was a long day for me.
To make matters worse my husband was driving and he has a severe case of road rage and it upsets me greatly.
I couldn't go to the airport with him today when he took Alan because I couldn't be in the car with him again so soon.
I get really agitated when he has one of his rages and he knows it --he just doesn't do anything to control it.
Because I knew that it always happens I asked him if he even wanted to go to the game (he doesn't like baseball that much) and if he did that I couldn't tolerate the "road rage" so if he went with us he had to keep it under control.
Obviously that didn't happen.
I can't change him, so I'm going to have to change the way I get around.
I've missed out on many things I want to do because I can't be in the car with him.
Around our town it isn't so bad because I can still get some places by myself.
It's harder when I need to go somewhere out of town.....but I'll figure it out.My son made a couple of changes on this website.
If you notice at the left, there is a link to this year's Memory Walk and a link to his blog.Now I need to get back into my routine and I'll feel a whole lot better.

I realize when my son comes home to visit how much I miss laughter.
When he is home we laugh all the time....at silly things....at life in general.....and even at ourselves.
I don't do that as much when he is not around.
I think I used to.....but not so much now.
Life really is too short not to laugh -- even if it is at our own expense.

<doc date=Tuesday, May 23, 2006>
Alan's home so I have been busy.
We've been trying to play golf as he lugged his clubs here from California so we thought we should put them to use.
My concentration isn't what it used to be so after about five holes I'm "done in for".
But, at least I'm out there trying and getting some exercise.We are off to relax in the mountains for a couple of days.
More soon.

My husband has been retired for about two weeks now.
He still thinks he is on vacation, but having him around all the time is starting to take a toll on me.
Although I have been trying to get out of the house when I can, having another body around the house all the time is just hard on me.
We've discussed the problems that I was going to face and how we can help to change the environment a bit.
We just haven't done anything about it and I guess it is time.
I've proposed some changes as far as making a "quiet room" for me.
The constant noise of the television being on all the time is really bothering me.
Having that extra noise in the house is very tiring.
Luckily, my husband isn't real needy and isn't a big conversationalist but I still feel the need to be somewhat engaging when someone else is in the house.....always having to be "on" if you will.
I haven't had to deal with that much since I have retired -- a few days on the weekend -- but then I would have Monday through Friday to get back into a routine.
The routine is certainly missing now that there is another person in the house.
I don't feel like I can carry on my regular routine with someone around.
I guess I'll have to get over that.
I've been pretty good about getting up and going to the gym in the mornings and a few other things that I regularly do, but when someone else is around it is just different.
I know it has only been a couple of weeks, but it is probably time to make some changes.
It is nice knowing someone is around in case I need some help, which on some days is more than others.
I'm just not very good with change these days.

Hope all the mother's out there reading this had a great Mother's Day.
I got enjoy watching some college tennis on the UGA campus.
The Georgia men are now headed to Stanford for next weeks NCAA tennis tournament.
I wish the tourney was being held in Athens (as it often is) because I enjoy watching -- but next year it will be back here and we'll get to enjoy seeing the best in the country play.
They make it look so easy!My son will be home on Saturday.
He has two exams this week.
I'm hoping he'll help me change a few things on this blog as it is getting a little boring!On Saturday I went to Atlanta to help film a Memory Walk video for the Georgia Alzheimer's Association.
They are putting this together for potential sponsors of the walk.
I hope it works -- we need support and anything we can do to get it will help.
I've already started raising money for the walk so you will probably be hearing from me shortly -- although our walk isn't until November.
Need to raise it when I can!
My husband's retirement is going o.k.
I think that he still feels like he is on vacation since it hasn't even been two weeks yet.
We have managed to "stay out of each other's way" pretty well so far.
It is different having him home though.
I realize all the little things I have to adjust to by having someone else in the house all day.
Plus, he hurt his back last week and hasn't been able to move around a lot so he has been kind of laying around the house these days.
I hope his back gets better before Alan comes home so we can play some golf or tennis.I've written enough for now -- more soon -- I promise!

to all my friends out there.
My son will be home next week so that will be a nice present for me.
It's easy to take our kids for granted.
Sometimes it is hard to see them for the individuals they are.
They'll always be our "children" regardless of how old they are.
I think the saying "you don't appreciate your parents until you have children of your own" is true.
I wish I would have learned that earlier.

My husband and I played our second tennis match on the little league I was telling you about a few weeks ago.
Rain in our area has forced us to cancel a couple of matches so we are a little behind.
I did a little better last night -- we still lost but we had a good match and it could have gone either way.
I still am walking around the court like a zombie most of the time, because I can't remember the score and can't remember who is serving.
I get into the point and my concentration is only on the point and nothing else.
My husband has a bad habit of not saying the score when he serves so I am having to ask him constantly what the score is.
He says it shouldn't matter what it is -- which is true because you should try to win every point and not play according to the score.
However, it is bad tennis etiquette not to say the score for everyone's behalf.
We had to play three sets and I held it together for that long, so I'm scoring a personal victory for holding on!We are suppose to play another match this week -- we'll see how that goes.My son will be home from law school in a couple of weeks.
I saw him about six weeks ago but it seems like a lot longer than that.
I really miss him being here -- do we ever get over that as parents?

Well, it is official, my husband is now retired.
There was a small party for him at the lab and it was so nice.
Everyone was so gracious and Ralph gave a very nice talk at the end.
That is not something he likes to do but I was very proud of him.
I know how hard that must have been for him.
We took some photos and I'll post some as soon as he takes them out of the camera.I gave him some golf lessons as a retirement present.
I hope he'll feel a little better about his swing after a few lessons.
He just needs to play more.
Now he has the time to do that.
I just need to find some other people for him to play with besides me.
Adjustment time is ahead.....for both of us.

My husband retires on Wednesday after spending 40 years with the US Government.
He certainly deserves it and I'm happy for him.
But at the same time I'm pretty depressed about it.
I feel guilty for saying that because it is selfish of me to think that way.
I'm used to having the house to myself, it is quiet all day long and I don't have to answer to anyone.
Having another person in the house makes me tired.
I started realizing several months ago how tired I was on Monday mornings and finally realized that I was more tired because there was more going on during the weekends with Ralph home and more was expected of me.
I had to actually participate in conversations and keep up with more.
Mentally, that is a lot for me.Ralph knows that some adjustments are going to have to be made.
From both of us.
I really don't know any couples that haven't had to go through some adjustments during the retirement stage.
It will be a few weeks before Ralph really feels like he is retired, as it will seem like a vacation for awhile.
Reality will eventually set in and hopefully we'll be ready for it.

I met an old friend for lunch this week.
I've know her for about 10 years and we don't get together very often which is a shame.
It had been about 8 or 9 months since we last saw each other and I was feeling pretty guilty about that.
I hate that I let so much time slip by since we last saw each other.
An occasional email and card were sent but it is so much better to get together.
So this week we met and it was as if no time had passed at all.
We picked up right where we left off and that is one of the great things about friends.
On the other hand, there are those friendships that you really have to work at.
I'm not real sure why that is, but some take more effort than others.
I've tried to evaluate whether those people are really friends or people that I know better than just acquaintances -- but I guess it doesn't really matter.
If they are worth having in your life, they are worth working on.Friends and family make the world go 'round -- don't forget that.

Several months ago I wrote in this blog about a friend who had a terrible skiing accident in Denver.
He suffered quite a few broken bones, lost sight in one of his eyes and took a pretty good blow to his head.
As a result he has been through a long journey and still has a long way to go.
He is out of the hospital now and into a rehabilitation situation.
I spent some time today with his fiance who is back in Athens getting ready to graduate from UGA.
I've been keeping up with his progress and realized early on that Brad was experiencing a lot of similar things that I experience as far as his brain injury is concerned.
It will be a long time before they actually know the extent of Brad's brain injury but some of the problems he is experiencing now are all too familiar to me.In talking with Lauren today we talked about how tired Brad gets and his doctor's have termed this as "cognitive fatigue" -- basically you brain gets tired.
I have often told people that I get so tired and the only explanation I have for it is "it's like taking a final exam for eight hours and you are mentally exhausted".
I guess now I can say it is "cognitive fatigue" --that sounds much better don't you think?
Some of Brad's other symptoms that are like mine are getting frustrated and agitated easily, not remembering the right words for things and dealing with emotion.
I guess when the brain is "injured" however that might come about a lot of the same symptons occur.
Lauren and I discussed how far the medical world has come on so many things but when it comes to the brain we seem to be miles behind.....or maybe it just seems that way.
There are probably a lot of other people thinking the same thing about the diseases that they have.
Brad and his family are on a long road to recovery.....to me it is so much harder on the families and you all know how I feel about that.
To me, that's the hardest part of having this disease, what it does to my family.
My best to Brad, Lauren and the rest of his family -- they have certainly shown a great deal of love and support to him and he will need more as the days and months and years progress.

It's been a busy week with the golf tournament and all.
I made it through my first day of "marshalling" a hole yesterday and have two more days of that.
The weather didn't cooperate the first part of the day so we ran about two hours behind.
All in all though I think it is goin pretty well.
Because of the weather delay I was on the course much longer than I thought I would and toward the end I was making a lot of mental mistakes because I was tired.
The mistakes weren't so bad that it messed up a player, just did some things that I wouldn't have necessarily done if I hadn't been so tired and "over extended" is probably a good word for it.I've seen a lot of people volunteering at the tournament I haven't seen for a long time.
Many of them I can't remember their names which is frustrating and I'm probably not remembering some of them at all.
But at least I'm out there.They've treated the volunteers extremely well with appreciation.
They have also been feeding us every day and since we are a country club it is country club food, not just sandwiches.
I've tried to stay on my diet the best I could but the food is pretty tempting.
One thing they had one day this week was fried chicken.
I haven't had fried chicken in probably well over a year because of my diet, but I had a piece this week and it was like heaven!
I think I even had a dream about it that night.
That's pretty pathetic isn't it?

One of the sponsors of our Memory Walk here in Athens last year was one of our hospitals.
This week they are hosting the Nationwide Tour of the PGA.
So, I decided to volunteer to work since they were good to us last year.
It's been fun watching the players.
It makes you want to go play some more.
I was hoping that by osmosis that at the end of the week I would play better, but that probably isn't going to happen!
I've been working on the driving range for two days and tomorrow I will be working on a hole as the tournament begins.
I suppose when Ralph retires in a few weeks, we'll be playing much more golf.
I used to play pretty well, but my concentration isn't what it used to be and that means I don't play real well now.
But at least I get out and get some exercise and enjoy the outdoors.
As many people have said, golf is kind of like a walk in the park chasing a little white ball.

I can't remember a time when I didn't play tennis.
I taught myself very young.
I've always been a tomboy and when my brothers wouldn't let me play baseball with them when I was young, I got a tennis racket and would hit tennis balls endlessly against a wall, near the baseball field so I could be close to my brothers and all the action that was going on.
My mom used to tell the story that my brothers wouldn't let me play baseball with them because I would turn cartwheels in the outfield.So I played a lot of tennis.
Sports for girls in high school were virtually non-existent at that time so I never really played on a "team" until my adult life.This all brings me to my tennis match today.
My husband signed us up to play in this mixed doubles league.
I have made it my practice to not play mixed doubles with my husband because it never seems to work out.
I play to win -- he plays for fun.
However, I said yes, and we started our league play today.The first set was fine -- we lost 7-5 but it was very competitive.
Then I lost it.
My concentration was shot, I put my earplugs in to help block out some of the noise.
I couldn't remember the score, I couldn't remember who was serving and I couldn't remember the last point.
I started having panic attacks and couldn't breathe.
I was so confused and so upset I started crying on the court before we started the second set.
Our opponents didn't see this (I don't think) but suffice it to say we never won another game.
I disappointed myself, but also my husband -- although he hasn't said that -- I just feel that.
I think I have now become a person who "doesn't play tennis" but rather a person that can go out and "hit the ball" for an hour or so and let it go at that.
So many other things that I have lost the ability to do, do not bother me as much as this.
Tennis has been a part of my life for over 40 years.
I've always been that self proclaimed "tennis snob" but I guess I won't be any longer.
I'm sure my tennis playing friends reading this will be rejoicing at that fact.
We still have five matches to go in our league and I'm not sure how I'm going to get through them or if I will be able to do it at all.
My husband has commented from time to time that I was always defined by what I did -- mainly by the jobs I have had over the years.
He worried that when I retired I would have a hard time, because I wouldn't be known for something.
I've always had relatively high profile jobs and he really felt that is what defined me.
It probably did sometimes.
But, I have always defined myself in many ways and one thing I was always proud to say was that "I was a tennis player".I guess I no longer am.
And that makes me very sad.

I know I have been a little slack lately in writing in this blog.
Sometimes I just can't think of what to write without boring all of you.
I've been working on a lot of projects and a few are coming to an end which will free up some of my time.
I was involved with a banquet this past Tuesday night which took a little more out of me than I thought it would.
But I have had a few days to rest up before I tackle something else.I hope everyone has a great Easter weekend.
The weather down here in the south is suppose to be 84 degrees over the weekend.
Tennis and golf weather it is.
I'll try to do better in the coming weeks about posting here.

<doc date=Monday, April 10, 2006>
The pollen has certainly made its presence known in the south.
The green stuff is all over the place and people are sneezing all the time.
The beauty of the trees, flowers and plants though somehow make it worth it.The spring makes me look forward to lots of things.....playing more tennis and golf and just being outside.
It is getting more difficult for me to play tennis and golf though as my concentration is not what it used to be.
But at least I can still get outside and get some fresh air.
I'm also looking forward to my son coming home next month.
He'll have completed his first year at law school at Stanford and he'll be home for a short break before heading back out to California for a summer job.
I cherish the time I have with him.And, this week is my 26th wedding anniversary.
I hate that my husband doesn't have brighter days to look forward to knowing that my illness will certainly affect his life more than mine.

For those of you that have known me for awhile you know that I have always been one to "say what was on my mind".
Sometimes that got me into trouble, but for me, what else is new?
So, what I am about to write will seem like a shock to you.
I'm having an increasingly difficult time saying the words that pop into my mind.
I know exactly what I want to say but I can't put the words together to make it mean what I want it to mean.
Yesterday, I was having a lunch meeting with some of the women on the Memory Walk committee for this year, and it seemed like every point I was trying to get across didn't come across the way I wanted it to.
I think they were able to get some things I was saying, but after the meeting I felt really bad because I know I must have sounded like an idiot at times.I'm also working with a national committee for a national Alzheimer's conference in Atlanta this fall.
Our work includes going over abstracts for speakers.
Since the committee is comprised of people from all over the country we are having conference calls to narrow the field of the speakers.
I have a difficult time working over the phone anyway, but to have lots of different voices coming at me makes it extremely difficult.
Then the lack of me being able to put sentences together to mean what I really want to say intimidates me so I end up being more silent than I feel I should be.
(What a shocker that is!)
I feel inadequate and very useless to the whole process when I can't contribute what I want.
I've said before that this disease makes me feel stupid and when I encounter days like yesterday I do feel stupid.
I know that I'm not stupid, but it's hard not to feel that way.Having come from a journalism background as a tv news reporter and writer for many different publications this becomes increasingly frustrating.
Communications has also been something I thought I did pretty well.
Since being diagnosed I have wanted to write a book, but I know that I couldn't do that without a lot of help.
I haven't found that help yet, so I guess for now this journal is the best I can do.....and I'm not really sure how good that is when I go back and read some of the posts I've written.
Thank you for reading anyway.

You know the feeling when you are on vacation and near the end of your vacation time you realize that it is going to be over soon and you'll be back to "reality".
Even though I'm retired, I still feel that way when I go away.
But since being back from Illinois I hadn't really thought that way until yesterday.
That's when the old brain decided to act up more than usual and I suddenly come back to that dreaded feeling I get when I think about this disease.
On good days I rarely think about it -- but when it rears its ugly head there's no denying it.On another front for "reality" -- in about three weeks my husband retires.
I know I have mentioned it before, but I think I have put it out of my mind.
What a change for him and definitely a change for me.
Having someone around the house all the time is going to definitely be hard.
My husband has a hard time being in the house without noise.
He has to have the television or the radio on.
I can't function like that -- there is never a tv or radio or anything that produces noise on during the day when I am home alone.
We will definitely be created a "no noise" room for me to escape to.
It will certainly be different for everyone.
My husband has worked for over 40 years in his job and he deserves to retire and we deserve to be able to do things while we still can.
But an adjustment to the way we live our lives is definitely around the corner.

I'm participating in a study with the Medical College of Georgia.
It basically is asking me and my blood family members for a couple of vials of blood for a study on genetic testing for Alzheimer's.
I have two brothers -- both older than me.
My oldest brother will not take part in the study.
The excuses are pretty lame and it bothers me a great deal that he refuses to take part.
It's just a couple of vials of blood and you have to answer a few questions.
I'm glad I don't need a kidney from him.

I returned home last night from my visit with my brothers and family.
My cold got better, but I managed to give it to Alan.
After he left me, he and his girlfriend Jennifer went to Lake Tahoe skiing.
He called me from the slopes to tell me I had passed it along.
I'm sure I told him "it is a nice thing to share".
Mind you -- he still had the energy to ski!It was nice visiting everyone -- but of course it is always nice to get home as well.
I certainly couldn't have done that trip alone -- I think those days are over for me -- at least maneuvering my way around Chicago on the buses and the EL.
Alan and I managed to see some friends, go to the Art Institute of Chicago, the Adler Planetarium and Navy Pier.
It was cold and windy -- what else do you get in Chicago?I wish my family lived closer or vice versa.
I always hated that Alan really never got to know his cousins very well.
Being an only child it would have been nice for him.

As I write this I am in Peoria, IL visiting my family for a few days.
Over the weekend I spent time in Chicago with my son.
We had some fun exploring Chicago and visiting with our friends Pody and Rick from Champaign.
Pody gave us a wonderful trip to the Art Insitute of Chicago by providing lots of information about the paintings.
She is an art history professor so I wouldn't expect anything less from her!
We got to visit her daughter's apartment in Chicago (Rachel is an attorney in Chicago, but was out of town), we went to Second City, Navy Pier, and the Adler Planetarium.
It was nice to be just be a "tourist" for awhile.
On Monday, Alan and I hopped a two hour train to Bloomington where we were met by my brother, his wife and my nephew for dinner before heading on to Peoria.The bad part about the trip so far is that I developed a cold the first day and some things I had planned for the trip I didn't do because I didn't have the energy and just didn't feel like it.
So, while in Peoria, I'm trying to take it easy so I can get to feeling a little better.
Plus, I'm extremely tired from the trip and some parts of it are harder than they should be.However, being around family is nice.
I don't see them often enough.More when I return.

Well, the calendar says it is spring, but the weather doesn't feel like it now.
A few weeks ago the temperatures were in the 70's and now we are lucky to get out of the 50's.
But I'm plunging into colder temps as I travel this weekend to Chicago to meet my son for spring break.
It's always cold in Chicago during fall, winter and spring.
And, the forecast calls for snow flurries.
Then we are taking a train to Peoria to meet with my family.
Alan will then head back out to the west coast and I'll spend a few more days visiting with my relatives.
My friends Pody and Rick (that we saw in England) will be joining us for a day in Chicago and Alan will catch up with a high school buddy that lives in Chicago now.
Lots to do, lots of people to see.
I just need to pace myself and try to get some rest when I can.
I know I'll have some interesting stories when I return.
I promise.

It is nice to have a "slow" weekend.
Not a lot on my plate and I need the rest.
I enjoy watching the basketball tournament -- both men and women's -- although I get confused a little when they keep switching back and forth between games.Next week, I'll be off to spend a few days with Alan and my family in the midwest.
It has been awhile since I have been up there and it is always good to see how everyone is and how big some of the children in my family have gotten.
I wish we lived closer so we could visit more often.
There never seems to be enough time to do a lot of things I'd like.Spring is officially tomorrow.
I wish the weather here in Georgia felt like it.

Well, yesterday I had a "once in a lifetime experience".
A professional group I still belong to had a "field trip" to Talladega Speedway in Alabama.
Although I knew it was going to be a long day and it would take me awhile to recover I thought that it was really something I wanted to do.
Not being a real fan of racing, I wasn't too sure about our excursion -- but it was great.Talladega is much larger than I thought it was going to be and we got to ride around the track at 120 MPH!
That was really awesome.
The slope on the turns is 34 degrees and it felt pretty amazing.
Now the real race car drivers go at 195 and they are just inches apart at times while racing --that is pretty scary to me.
Considering there were only two cars on the track when I was on it and it was scary, I cannot imagine what that must feel like.I guess I don't have the natural urge for the "need for speed".

One symptom of Alzheimer's can be hallucinations.
I have never really had them, but I do hear things.
The things I hear are not voices but "sounds that don't belong" -- like a door slamming when it shouldn't be or a car honking its horn when there are no cars around.
Quite frequently I hear a door in our house slam.
I am usually in the back part of the house when I hear this and go out to see if my husband may have come in and I didn't hear his car pull up.
But no, when I go look he is not home and there is no one hear but me and the cats.
And, the door that I swear I hear slam is already shut and I knew it was all day long.
I've mentioned this several times to my husband because it is so annoying but he always tells me not to worry about it -- it is probably a sound coming from the neighbor's house and it just sounds like it is coming for our house.
So, I haven't mentioned it in awhile.This weekend, our son was in Atlanta spending the night and expected to arrive home around noon on Sunday morning.
At around 5:00 a.m. my husband "heard a door slam" and woke me up when I heard him say "Alan is home".
When I looked at the clock, I knew there was no way Alan would be coming in at 5:00 a.m. when he was spending the night in Atlanta.
I rolled over and tried to go back to sleep.
My husband did not hear Alan come in or go to his room so he got up and went to look in the garage to see if the car was there.
Alan was not home -- Ralph was "just hearing my noises"!
I told him that it was the exact same sound I would hear during the day and how annoying it was.
He was convinced someone had slammed that door.
Now his explanation is "maybe we have ghosts"!

Many of you have been asking me to post a new photo of my son.
Since he was home this weekend I thought it would be a good opportunity.
It's not the best photo in the world and maybe when I see him in a few weeks in Chicago we can do better.My hair is a lot longer and in this photo it isn't curled so it looks a bit straggly.
Many of you have never seen my hair that long.
I decided to start letting it grow about a year and a half ago.
Since I wasn't working everyday and didn't have to spend a lot of time on it everyday, I thought I would try it.
It has been well over thirty years since I have had any length to my hair.
Some say it is because I turned 50 and this is my "mid-life crisis" -- if so, I say great -- since that isn't much of a "crisis" to me.
It's surprising that a lot of folks don't recognize me with long hair, but sometimes that can be a blessing, because I don't remember them so then I don't feel so awkward!Alan is safely back in Palo Alto facing a full day of classes.
It was certainly nice to have him home.
Now back to the routine!

Well, it is just Saturday afternoon but it has already been a long weekend.
My husband and I just got back from Augusta where I spoke at a conference for the Alzheimer's Association for caregivers.
Everyone was so nice and very attentive when I spoke.
I have said before that it seems like good therapy for me when I do this and I hope in some small way I am able to help others.
The group was great and so very gracious.
I appreciate being asked to speak because I have no idea how long I'll be able to continue to do it.
It's tiring but it is so worth it.
There are a lot of people out there fighting for us that -- it is the least I can do for now.
Thanks to Kathy and Kimberly for asking me to be a part of the conference.My son is off to Atlanta for the tribute to his friend that passed away.
It has been hard for me as a parent, as it is for most parents, I suspect, that you hurt when your children hurt.
Losing a friend at such a young age is tough.
Adam was a special individual and did more in his short life than many will do in their entire lifetime.
His parents should be proud and I know that those in his life are much better off by having Adam as a friend.Alan will be leaving to go back to California tomorrow and the house will be much quieter.
But I hate to see him go.
I just get used to him being around and he is off again.
In a few weeks, though, we will be in Chicago together for a few days and getting to visit with friends and family.
That will be nice.

Well, it has certainly taken me longer to rest up from Little Rock than it should have.
It has just been hard for me to get up these days.
Although, the doctor gave me a new sleeping pill a couple of weeks ago -- maybe it is starting to work!I have a speech to give this weekend.
It is in Augusta at an Education conference for caregivers.
I haven't spoken for awhile so I hope I do o.k.
When I go, I usually take two versions of a speech with me -- one that is totally written out and then one that is just notes.
Depending on what kind of a day I am having will determine whether or not I have to read it or I can wing it from notes.
Not sure what kind of day Saturday will be.
I always hope that I can leave folks with a little something that they didn't already know, but at times it seems like I am "preaching to the choir" since many have been associated with this disease much longer than I have.Last night on NBC news they spoke to a gentleman that had early stage Alzheimer's.
That gentleman was in Washington DC at the Public Policy Forum with me for a couple of years.
He seems to still be doing pretty well.
I haven't seen him in about a year.
I hope I can say that in another year.My son will be home tonight to attend his friend's memorial service this weekend.
It will be nice to have him home, although I wish it was under better circumstances.

Well, I came home from Little Rock in one piece.
Our team lost in the semi-finals and we were not real happy about that.
The trip back was long due to construction, but it is nice to be home.My son is coming home this week.
He is coming home for a memorial service for his friend Adam.
(See post below).
Adam's death saddens me so much.
My heart goes out to his family and friends because it is such a tragic loss.
I guess Adam  has "gone home" too.

Well, as I write this I am in Little Rock Arkansas -- the women are winning and that is a good thing.
I've finally figured out how to get the computer to work while I am here.But driving over to Little Rock on Thursday, I got a call from my son in California.
He had been notified that one of his best friends and former room mate at Georgia Tech had been found dead in his apartment in Atlanta.
His name was Adam Stevens.
Adam had taken a job with a company in Norcross (outside of Atlanta) after he graduated so he and Alan were able to stay connected.
He traveled a lot for business and he recently returned from a two week business trip to India.
Adam evidently died upon his return because he didn't contact his office when he returned and they sent someone looking for him and his body was found.
Foul play is not suspected, nor is drugs or alcohol.
Alan told me that Adam had a thyroid problem but he didn't think it was life threatening.
It is so sad to lose someone so young.
He was in his early 20's.
In high school my son had a friend that was killed in a car accident and one friend was murdered.
When I was growing up I didn't have to experience the death of any friends, just family.
That is hard on young people.
It is such a shame.
An autopsy will be done on Adam's body to determine the cause of death.
I feel so bad for his parents and for his friends.Life is so precious.

I'm back on the road this weekend -- to watch the UGA Women's basketball team play in the SEC tournament in Little Rock Arkansas.
My husband isn't going with me -- I'm going with three other ladies and we are driving out there.
I'm a little anxious about it because I don't travel well these days.
I feel more comfortable when my husband is with me -- but all of these ladies are my friends and they understand my situation.
I'm fortunate to have friends that still want to go places with me!I hope we are gone for several days because that means we are winning!

I think I have mentioned in this blog many times how I don't do well with change these days.
Routine is what I need but lately a lot of things have been changing.
So far, I've not done too bad -- a bad day here and there but for the most part, not too awful.My doctor once told me that she felt that it wasn't change affecting me as much as it was the "unknown" -- not knowing what was going to happen.
If the change was planned I did better.
I hope this makes sense.I guess there will be a true test in a couple of months when my husband retires.
May 3rd is his last day of working for Uncle Sam.
He certainly deserves it....he has worked there for forty years and it is the only job he has ever had.
It will be difficult adjusting to that change....both for him and me.

I told you last week we went to Nashville for a women's basketball game.
Well, this week I went with the team to Arkansas for a game with the University of Arkansas.
We flew over one night and returned the next night after the game.
It was a long day but we won and that is a good thing.
Next weekend I am off to Little Rock Arkansas for the women's SEC basketball tournament.
I get really tired on these trips and I'm not real good company.
Luckily, I have friends that drag me along and don't care if I can carry on a decent conversation!
The weekend after that Ralph and I will be going to Augusta where I have a speech to give at an Alzheimer's conference.
Those trips are harder on me because I actually have to do things, and it brings the realization of this disease out more.
I talk about it with others and there always seems to be great conversation -- that's a good thing I guess.I've gone back and looked at some recent posts and I realize that there are alot of mistakes in them.
I guess I need to figure out how to use spell check on this blog, but I also realize that when I have written these posts, I have been extrememly tired.
My brain doesn't work so well when I'm tired.Thanks, Roger, for your comments.
I look forward to meeting you in a few weeks.

Ralph and I went on a bus trip this past weekend to Nashville to watch the UGA Women's Basketball team play Vanderbilt.
I kept watching the weather all last week and Nashville and the lower Tennessee area was suppose to get a lot of freezing rain and snow.
I was a little concerned going over the mountains to get to Nashville, but in talking with the bus company they said it was the driver's call on whether to go or not, so I figured that if the bus driver thought he could do it he would.
And he did, the weather wasn't as bad as predicted I don't think but it was cold -- 11 degrees in Nashville.
And, there was snow on the ground.
It was nice to see snow.....I miss it sometimes living in the south.
And, of course, all of you know that I miss ice skating even more!The best part of the weekend is that we won the basketball game.
We needed win.
Now I have to rest for a few days.
That took a lot out of me!

It's been a busy week and this weekend we are going to Nashville to watch a women's basketball game.
There was a game last night and our team lost in a heartbreaker.
I do enjoy going to the games but sometimes they can be rough on me.
If I'm not rested it is hard and the noise is overwhelming sometimes.
Last night I forgot my ear plugs so it was particularly hard.
And, what made is worse is that we lost.

Last night I went to a memorial service for a man who had taken his life at the early age of 48.
He was married to a friend of mine.
It was so sad.
They have a son that is just a couple of years older than my son and he is due to be married this summer.
What a shame his father will not be by his side.
At the service they played a Travis Tritt song that was dedicated to the sone -- I think the name of it was "I See Me" and the song was about a man describing his son and the son not having fallen far from the apple tree.
I think about my son and my husband.
They are a lot a like and then they aren't.
I worry about not being with my son on his wedding day -- at least maybe not mentally.
And it bothers me -- so we have to be sure to cherish the time we do have with our family.
My heart goes out to my firend and her family.

My memory is getting so much worse.
I have been losing lots of things around the house.
I just can't seem to remember where I put things and I'll put things in very weird places.
It's so frustrating.
Yesterday, I was re-organizing all of my scrapbooking stuff and kept losing track of things.
I combined a lot of things to cut down on the clutter and then couldn't remember doing it.
And, I'm not recognizing people.
I know some people look at me like I should know them and they don't say anything.
I rationalize it by telling myself that because I am wearing my hair longer that people don't recognize me -- therefore they don't say anything -- but I have a strong feeling it is the other way around -- they are looking at me, realize I don't recognize them and then don't say anything.
It's that stare they give me, that tells me that I should know who they are.How frustrating.

I have had a very hard time sleeping these past few months.
Not exactly sure why -- but I find myself a few steps behind everyone during the day from being tired.
Besides that I have had weird dreams when I do sleep.
In the mornings I can usually figure out why I had the dream, but certainly not the meaning of it.
Last night I dreamed that I was in a cage on display at a circus type event and underneath it said "Has Alzheimer's Disease".
I hope people didn't pay a lot to see that!

are great to have.
I know I have written in this blog about how important friends are in my life -- now more than ever.
But, I worry about not being a good enough friend back.
Several friends I have are carrying big burdens of their own and I don't feel like I am there for them the way they have been for me.
What am I doing about it?
Not much right now.
Some of their burdens I can't carry with them right now for various reasons, but it doesn't mean that I'm not there with them and appreciating what they are going through.
I've tried to help the best I can, but I'm not sure that is good enough.
I'm going to have to change that.
To all of my friends out there -- thank you -- I do appreciate you!

I'm having one of those days where I just feel helpless.
Not helpless as far as myself goes, but in being able to help others.
In my post on January 18th, I wrote about my friend's fiancee.
Tomorrow he faces a huge surgery and I'm very concerned about him.
You can read about him here http://www.caringbridge.org/cb/inputSiteName.do?method=search&siteName=bradplain.
Please keep him in your prayers and thoughts, tomorrow is a big day.
I feel helpless in there isn't much I can do for my friend Lauren.
I guess it bothers me much more because she and Brad are about the same age as Alan.
But, they are strong and they will get through this one way or another.
I wish I could help.It is also times like this that I wish I was doing more to help others.
I sometimes don't go out of the house for days and wonder why I am wasting my time.
I need to change my ways.
</doc>
<doc date=Thursday, January 26, 2006>
Well, I had one of my bad days today -- and it is barely noon!
Just about every morning I get up and go work out at the gym.
It's about 1 1/2 miles away from our house.
And, every morning I go to the gym the same way.
This morning, though, instead of turning right out of my driveway I turned left.
You can get to the gym by going left it just takes a little longer.
But, when I realized that I wasn't going the "right way" to the gym, I became extremely disoriented and lost.
I could not figure out how to get to the gym.
So I drove back home and started all over, went the correct way out of the driveway and got to the gym.After going to the gym I decided to stop at Wal-Mart and pick up one item.
I drove down to Wal-Mart and when I walked in the store I realized that all kinds of things had been moved around and there were thirty or forty carts filled with merchandise that the employees were rearranging.
I immediately had a panic attack -- because what I was seeing was "not right" -- it wasn't the same way it was in my head and I didn't know what to do.
I froze in place.
I literally could not move my feet.
It was like I was scared of something.
The only other time I felt like that was when I was in Arizona climbing some rocks and I saw a rattlesnake.
I was so terrified I could not move.
Back to Wal-Mart.
I did my deep breathing exercises and tried to relax.
I relaxed enough that I could walk right back out of the store and go home.
I usually have a problem going into Wal Mart anyway -- it is sensory overload to me.
About the only time I can go is between 6 and 7 in the morning when it is relatively quiet and there are not many people around -- but obviously not today!
By now, I should realize when these things happen to me I just need to come home and stay at home.
But, I had a long list of things to do and after getting settled down a bit I looked over the list and crossed a few things off to save for another day.
I decided to try a couple more places.
Back to the car and off to the Post Office.When I was in the Post Office two people came up to me and were talking to me.
They both called me by name and chatted to me as if we were long lost friends, but I have no idea who they were or how they knew me.
I am always embarassed to ask people who they are but I shouldn't be.
Recognizing people and remembering things about them has always been something I could do.
My husband thinks that these might have been people that I have met recently therefore I can't remember them as easily.
It is so frustrating because this is something that I was always so good at.I was able to make one more stop before heading home.
When I got home, I walked in the kitchen and the kitchen floor was a mess.
It's obviously been that way for a few days but I just cried because it was so dirty.
I couldn't figure out how to clean it.
I swept the dirt,but it didn't come up and then I couldn't figure out what to do next.
I cried some more.
How silly -- but uncontrollable nonetheless.
I called my husband and asked him if when he came home tonight he could clean the kitchen floor.
I'm not sure in my whole life I have ever fretted over having a dirty kitchen floor!Tomorrow is another day.

I have started this post many times and didn't finish it.
I was afraid that those of you that read this blog will think I am writing about you -- and then I realized that the people I am going to write about probably don't read this blog so it doesn't matter anyway!
So, if you are reading this -- it isn't about you.I have very little patience these days.
I don't think I ever really had a lot to begin with but I thought over the years I had gotten better.
I don't know if my lack of patience these days is because of my Alzheimer's or my just getting older (yes, Carol you will be there one day too!
).But, I get so frustrated these days by some of my so called friends who just take things for granted because they think they can.
I'm much less tolerant of these people, because life is just too short!On another note, a friend of mine's fiancee was in a very serious ski accident in Colorado.
He is showing some positive signs now, but he has a very long recovery ahead of him.
He has a great deal of reconstructive surgery on his face ahead of him, and they are not sure of the extent of any brain damage he may have suffered quite yet.
He was taken off the ventilator yesterday and is breathing on his own.
That's a great sign -- and he has shown movement in his limbs.
He had been in a medically induced coma for several days after being airlifted out of the ski slope in Denver.
My friend and he just got engaged over Christmas.
They have a very long road ahead of them.
Please keep them in your thoughts and prayers.After hearing the news of this accident, I realized how much I miss my son these days.
I know they have nothing to do with each other, but there are days when he seems millions of miles away.
When he initially left for college five years ago my husband was very upset about him leaving and seemed to miss him much more than I did.
Now, that seems to be reversed.
My husband now sees him as the adult he is and he has his own life.
But, as a mother, I guess I will always look at him as "my little boy" (don't all mothers?)
and wish he was at least closer to home.
I guess I become more realistic as to what "good time" I have left to share with my family.

I apologize for not posting in awhile.
I think of things during the day to write about and then I either forget, or realize that noboday wants to hear about that anyway!
So, I promised myself that I would post something today even if this is all it was!It is extemely warm down here for this time of year (70 degrees) and I think that kind of has my mood messed up because "it's not normal".
It is suppose to get a little cooler this weekend and then maybe I will feel better.
Yesterday, I went to Atlanta and met a very nice lady that has early on-set Alzheimer's.
She was a real delight to get to know and we bonded instantly.
I certainly hope that we can continue seeing each other and "comparing notes".My son is taking his first set of final exams for law school.
His last one is today and then he will have a little break.
I'll be glad when this is over for him and he can get a gauge on how he is doing.
His girlfriend started a new job this week.
So, a few changes for them right now.Well, the mind is a little slow today so will close for now.
I'll try to do better!

It's New Year's Eve and all is quiet.
Alan went out to lunch with a friend.
Ralph is in St. Louis -- his sister-in-law passed away a couple of days ago and he drove up for the funeral.
This was his brother Tom's wife and it is very tragic.
Not only to pass away at the holidays but to pass away so young -- she was in her late 50's and had cancer.
She got extremely ill very quickly.
So, it has been a bittersweet holiday.
It has been nice having Alan home -- since he has been studying for final exams we haven't been doing a lot.
He has been very very good and staying in his room and studying.
It's very hard for me to not go into his room when he is studying and I have probably interrupted him more times than I should have!But, because he has been so "quiet" I have found this holiday to not be too bad.
Usually we are doing a lot more and I get more tired.
But, this has been a good one on that side of things.Well, I guess while the house is quiet I'll try to retire for a nap.
I really notice a difference when I don't get my rest.
Hope everyone has a great new year!

I promise to write much more soon -- this was taken on Christmas Day.Hope everyone had a great holiday.

It's a few days before Christmas and all through our house it is pretty quiet.
Alan is home and studying hard since his finals are January 4th.
What a great way to spend your Christmas vacation.
Ralph is taking some time off while Alan is home.
We are trying to visit with friends when we can and relax at the same time.
Alan's girlfriend, Jennifer and her parents and sister are coming over for dinner on Christmas as well as some other friends.
That's what Christmas is about -- spending time with those you care for and all of these people are as close to family as we can get down here in the South.
I miss being with my family in Illinois, but maybe some year we will try to do that.I hope everyone has a wonderful Christmas and I'll post again soon -- I promise!

It's hard to admit doing stupid things -- I certainly have my share of that lately.
I think that I need to stop trying to cook when others are not in the house.
On Friday, I decided to try to make some cookies.
I got out my ingredients and turned the oven on.
A few minutes later there was smoke coming from the oven --- when I opened it I found that I had but the sticks of butter in the oven when I got them out!
I had a real mess on my hands.
That's what happens when I try to do things when I'm tired.
A friend of mine who has Alzheimer's once told me that her smoke detector was her kitchen timer!
At least I caught it before the smoke detector went off -- I did think to turn the fan on to get rid of the smoke.In England, I had one day where I could not remember where I had been the day before.
I tried and tried and got so frustrated.
We were doing so much, and eventually, with a little prodding from my husband I remembered parts of my day.
I guess that is why it isn't a good idea for me to travel by myself.
</doc>
<doc date=Thursday, December 08, 2005>
Well, we are back from a wonderful trip to England.
We spent most of our time with our friends, Pody and Rick from Illinois.
Pody is teaching in Canterbury this semester and what a lovely city.
It reminded me of going to a Renaissance Festival.
It was so beautiful.
The Canterbury Cathedral is just a five minute walk from Pody's apartment and it is so amazing.
Pody got us tickets to a Christmas Carol concert at the Cathedral one night and it was a candlelight service with their boy's choir singing.
You can just imagine how that was.
And on Saturday morning, there was a Christmas parade and Father Christmas met the Archbishop of Canterbury at the end of the processional.
Then there were carols and a small ceremony.
Father Christmas garnered much more attention than the Archbishop.
The amazing thing that Pody and I both noticed was that if this had been done in America there would have been security all over the place with barricades and crowd control.
But not the case in Canterbury.
The parade was not what we think of as a parade here -- it is hard to describe but soon I will post some photos on the blog.
But the meeting of the Archbishop is a big deal and there was no one "protecting" him or security.
And, Pody and I actually got to speak with him....which was even more amazing.
Pody had greetings for him from the University of Illinois where the Archbiship had a god daughter that attended there.
Someone casually said to Pody before she left Illinois, if you ever see the Archbishop send him our regards.
Well, who ever thought that would happen but it did!I guess the funny thing to me was that when I was in England over 30 years ago, I stayed with some friends in Manchester.
They had a dinner to go to in London and they took me along and at the dinner was the Archbishop of Canterbury.
I had no idea who he even was (I was only 18 and pretty ignorant about all that stuff) and I got to meet him and talk with him.
I wasn't real impressed at the time because I really didn't know anything about the Church and all of that stuff!
It is a different Archbishop now, but to think that my path crossed with the Archbishop's twice is something I would have never thought would happen.Pody has been sick with a cold and I felt bad as she and her husband played host since she was sick, she should have been getting some rest.
I did o.k.
-- got tired but we did a lot and that was to be expected.
There is more to tell and I will at another post with promised pictures.
I just wanted to give you a quick post and let you know that we have returned.
I'm anxious to share our adventure with you.Kris

I hope everyone had a nice Thanksgiving.
It was very strange to have a Thanksgiving without our son.
The day seemed a little empty.
But, on Thanksgiving night we shared a wonderful meal with long time friends, who have become our extended family since moving to Athens twenty five years ago.
I am thankful for that -- it just would have been nicer to have the kid here!The next few days will be spent cleaning out the refrigerator and getting packed for England.
We are looking forward to going and visiting with our friend Pody and her husband Rick.
My sister-in-law is from London and although she has lived in Illinois for over 30 years, she was still able to give us some ideas to see some sights in London that would be decorated for Christmas.
I worry that I will be a drag on my husband, but hopefully he has traveled enough with me that he will be used to it.
I don't travel real well these days and when I get tired, I get very forgetful and confused.
Hopefully, we will pace ourselves.
When I was in California it was hard, but I did realize that I was there with my family and it didn't matter if I was confused or forgot something, because they were there with me to get me through it.Ta Ta For Now

<doc date=Wednesday, November 23, 2005>
I hope that all of my friends out there know that I am truly grateful for their friendship, support and love they give me all year round -- not just at Thanksgiving.A friend of mine's mother was in town from the Northeast for Thanksgiving.
I met the mother several years ago when my friend invited me to have lunch with them.
Since then, her mother and I have exchanged friendly emails and I usually catch up with her for lunch when she is in town.
Yesterday, we spent the better part of the day together as her daughter was working.
I enjoyed the day so much -- I think I enjoyed mostly feeling for a few hours that I was "part of the family".
I miss that -- not having a large family, not having family close by.
Thanks Mrs. K for making my day special....and thanks to your daughter for sharing you with me!Happy Thanksgiving to everyone!

It's hard for me to write about my bad days even though I know that many of you like to hear the good and bad.
I had a really busy week last week and definitely over did it.
I try to pace myself but I'm not very good at it sometimes.
I was so tired after doing too much.
On Saturday morning I tried to do a task of organizing things and getting them into piles -- pretty easy stuff.
It took me three hours and then asking my husband for help, to do a job that should have taken at most about 20 minutes.
It's so frustrating.
I just need to not put myself in those situations -- or manage my time better.
I keep saying to myself "if I can just get past Wednesday, or Thursday or whatever"....but sometimes it just doesn't seem to end.
I have got to do better.And, I get in a panic too easily.
A panick attack came on over the weekend out of the blue and I hate that.
I didn't leave the house all weekend.
Not fair to my husband when he wants to do stuff -- but I don't know that I can do anything about it.
The doctor said if they got too bad that he would give me some medicine, but I just don't want to take any more medicine.We have a trip to England coming up in a few weeks.
I am very very anxious to go but at the same time a little worried about the crowds and the confusion.
I'm looking to my husband to take the lead and to help me -- he will if I ask him to, but he really needs to do it this time without me having to ask him to.
He has got to take charge (something he is not used to) or he will probably have a pretty hysterical wife on his hands!

Learning new things is difficult to someone that has Alzheimer's.
Your brain just can't process things like it used to.
Today I was doing something around the house and came across a task that I hadn't done in quite awhile.
So, I decided to tackle it.
I'm not going to say what is was because it was really quite trivial and it will make me sound stupid.
But, for the life of me I couldn't remember how to do it and the directions just didn't make sense.
Frustration is not even a word that can relate to how I felt.
After a few tears about it I left it alone.
I then came back to it with not much more success.
How incompetent this can make you feel.
It's hard for me to accept that I just can't do certain things anymore.
Perhaps I'll try again later.

Well, the trip to California is now history.
It was a great trip -- the weather was great and seeing Alan (and Jennifer) was even greater.
I forget how much I miss Alan when I don't see him.
It seems like it was harder for me to leave this time, than it was for me to see him leave on his trip out there.
It's hard to imagine that he is his own man now, not relying on his parents and making his way for himself.
I know that is what we raise them for, but it's hard to see that happen sometimes.We spend Alan's 22nd birthday with him.
It was nice to be able to spend it together.
We spent the day walking around the Stanford campus, Ralph and Alan played some tennis, we went out for dinner and came back to their apartment for cake and presents.
The weather was so beautiful.On Saturday we went up to San Francisco and went to Golden Gate Park and to the Japanese Tea Garden there.
It was really pretty.
Then we went to the Presidio and took a hiking trail.
We didn't go down to the tourist spots on Fisherman's Wharf because we had been there before.
We were searching for new places to explore.
I had a hard time that day because I kept forgetting where we were.
Later in the day, I just realized that it didn't matter where I was but that I was with my family and that is all that mattered.I don't think I could ever get used to living on the Pacific Coast in Pacific Time Zone.
It is just not right to be watching football in the morning!
All of the live ESPN programming ran at it's usual time on Eastern time, but it is three hours earlier out there so football games that start at noon show in California at 9:00 a.m. --- that's just not right.
The prime time programming on the major networks is held back, but it is still odd.
I'm still somewhat jet lagged.
I think I stayed in CA long enough to get used to their time, only to come back and have to get readjusted to our time.
So, as I remember more, I will write more.All in all -- it was a good trip.

Well the Memory Walk is over.
It was a great day weather wise and we are hopefully going to come close to our goal of $50,000.
It will be close but we are keeping our fingers crossed.
It was an exhausting day after setting up the night before, walking the 3 miles and tearing everything down after the walk.
Luckily, we had a fraternity on the UGA campus helping us and they was a huge help.
They are much younger than we are!
Thanks again to everyone that donated to the cause!But the walk took a toll on me.
I was really tired and didn't have a good day today (Monday).
I went out to run some errands but just got too confused -- partly I think because I was still tired.
A good long nap this afternoon helped clear my fuzzy brain a little.We are going to visit Alan on Wednesday and I'm looking forward to it.
I know it will be a hard trip for me but I need to see my son.
It's been almost two months that he has been gone and it's time to see him.
His birthday is Friday and I'm glad we will get a chance to be with him.
It's kind of an insignificant number (22) but it's a birthday just the same.
It's nice to be with family on your birthday.
I really missed him on mine a week or so ago.
So, when we return I hope I have great things to tell you about the trip.
I just have to pace myself and try not to get too tired.
Although I've been to California a couple of times, it is still not that familiar to me to feel comfortable.
At least I won't be alone.
</doc>
<doc date=Friday, October 14, 2005>
Our Memory Walk is tomorrow and I would like to thank everyone again who donated to the cause.
The generosity of everyone has been overwhelming to me.
I really appreciate everything!
The weather looks like it is going to be nice and that's a good thing!
I'll write more after the walk and before we take off next week to see Alan at Stanford.
Thanks again everyone.

On Sunday, I turn 50 years old....a milestone in most people's books.
But as I get older I feel how much I am regressing (I hope that is the right word) into a world that is unknown to me.
Some days I feel as young as a five year old, when I can't do simple tasks like sorting shapes and objects.
Other days I feel more than my age with my aches and pains of getting older and being out of shape.We all "have our days" I guess, but as I look into the future I see more dark days than light ones.
And, since the concept of age is all in our minds, you can only imagine what type of a concept I have in mine.

This past weekend my husband and I went to the mountains in northeast Georgia with a friend whose family has a cabin up there.
This was our second trip and it is so peaceful up there.
It was much cooler up there and it was a nice break from the heat we have been experiencing.
It's nice to get away even for a day or so.
I was bothered by panic attacks while there and I was surprised by that -- I don't know if it was because I was in a somewhat unfamiliar place or not -- but I got through it.I've been working a lot on the Memory Walk which is October 15th.
I don't think I can be on the organizing committee next year, as it is taking way too much out of me.
I can only imagine what next year would be like for me if I continue.
But, there are many people that are stepping forward and it will certainly be in good hands.
I was doing a radio interview this week for the walk.
And, the show's host is a friend of mine.
She said something at the end of the interview that made me pause.
She told me that since my diagnosis so many people in the community have been pulling for me and that I have so many people who care about me that I am blessed.
I know that and I appreciate everyone.
But sometimes it takes someone to remind you how blessed you are.
Thanks to everyone.

a way to express what happens with a lot of noise -- many of you know how distracting it is to me with lots of noise around me and how difficult it is for me to concentrate.
It is hard for me to put into words but I found this article this morning and it makes me feel better -- http://my.webmd.com/content/article/112/110336.htm

I couldn't think of a title for this post -- so for now "untitled" is what it will be.
It has been one of those weeks -- things not quite synching in the way they should.
I have been so unmotivated this week -- I think mainly because I have been unable to focus and get things into perspective.
It isn't that I dont' have a lot that I can be doing -- I just can't seem to get there.
My medicines have been acting up on me -- making me sick to my stomach.
I've been trying to lose weight again and I think my lower caloric intake is upsetting my stomach with the medicine.
But, I'm going to try to work through it and hopefully it will get better.
It is always something isn't it?
But, it has been hard for me to concentrate this week and getting anything accomplished has been a chore.
Some weeks are like that.
Hopefully, I'll have a better outlook soon.
It's very frustrating to know that you have things to be doing and just can't quite figure out how to get them done!
It's like I don't know what I am suppose to be doing and I need someone to draw me a map.
Then I think I could follow it.

I'm having one of those "anxiety" weeks -- trying to fend off all too common panic attacks.
It is very weird how they come on -- but I just get this feeling that I have to be home.
I feel much better when I am home -- last week when I went to the neurologist he asked me if it was making me a "hermit" --and I wouldn't say that that is the case, I just feel better at home.
I can't quite wrap my feelings around it -- it is just that I need to be home.On another note, I received a lovely note from a lady that attended my talk in Gainesville last week.
That meant so much to me.

<doc date=Thursday, September 08, 2005>
Yesterday I drove t Gainesville Georgia where I spoke to the Commerce Club.
My friend Carol set it up for me and there were about 20 women there.
I decided I was having a good enough day that I could speak from just my notes and it turned out pretty well.
I'm never quite sure going into it whether I'm going to hit a chord with the group I'm speaking to or not.
But, as I have said before, this is much for therapy for me as it is hopefully an education for them.
They were extremely gracious women and made me feel very comfortable -- I'm sure it is that Southern Charm.
But, I appreciate them taking the time to listen to my message and hopefully I was able to answer a few questions for them.
I enjoyed myself but I was extremely tired when I returned home and a nap was in store.
I have spoken to a group in about a month and it took more out of me than I thought it would -- but it was worth it -- it is always worth it!
Thanks again to the ladies in Gainesville for having me.

My son came through for me (as I knew he would!)
but be nice --- everyone else can read your comments!

<doc date=Monday, September 05, 2005>
is what it seems like to me when I look at the devastating photos from New Orleans.
I was glued to my tv set for the first few days of Katrina and then I started getting so depressed I stopped watching.
I cannot even imagine what those people are going through.
My problems don't seem to be very big when I see that.My son has made it to Stanford and starts his classes tomorrow.
It seems like it has been a long time coming -- I know he will enjoy his studies.
Before he left, he was going to alter my blog site somewhat in order for you to send comments, but that is a task that didn't get done and probably won't for awhile.
That is certainly not a priority now.I have been working as much as I can on the Memory Walk as it is in about 6 weeks.
It overwhelms me at times and I keep thinking that I can continue like I used to and I know that I can't.
It's just hard to get that in my mind sometimes!
I don't know what my role will be next year, it is probably time for me to be off the committee and just gather my friends, raise money and walk for the good of the cause.To all of those that have donated to the Walk in my honor, thank you.
I know for many there are more pressing issues in the world right now than finding a cure for Alzheimer's -- but I hope we don't lose sight of it.

Well, yesterday was an emotional day for my husband and I.
Our son drove off to California to go to Stanford Law School.
Considering we live in Georgia, it's a long way away.
There were naturally lots of tears, but we know that this is the right place for him.
We are very proud of him and we know that he will do well.
He is a great son.

On Sunday night we had a going away party for my son and his girlfriend.
It was so nice that everyone showed up and we had a good time.
I was really exhausted after it though.
On Monday Alan and I went out to play golf.
I've been having a problem with my right foot -- the same one I broke awhile back.
And, it was hurting so bad when I got home that I decided it was finally time to go see the doctor.
To make a long story short, I am now in a "boot" and go back in ten days to see what is going on.
It appears that I have a stress fracture in my foot and a bone spur that is rubbing up against my Achilles Tendon.
None of this is good.
We'll see what happens after I go back to the doctor.Alan is getting all of his stuff ready for Stanford.
He'll leave next Tuesday.
I have been dreading this day -- and it will be here before I know it.I go back to the neurologist on Monday.
I haven't been in awhile and I can't imagine he is going to tell me a lot -- wish there were some new "cures" out there!Our computer has been sick for a few days and it hasn't allowed me to get to the internet or my email.
Since it is difficult for me to talk on the phone my computer is kind of like my "lifeline" if you will.
I can go back and re-read emails and take me time composing as that is difficult sometimes.
Luckily, my husband was able to fix it and now I feel "back to normal".

Today started out a good day.
Today was our Memory Walk Captain's Luncheon.
Outback Steakhouse provided lunch for our committee and for those who are going to have a team in this year's Memory Walk.
I didn't have to do much for it -- I got some door prizes together and helped with whatever I could.
I wasn't even speaking -- I did last year, but I thought they needed to hear someone else speak this year.
The lunch went well but in the end I realized how stressed I was.
I shouldn't have been.....it was just a lunch.
And when I think that I used to be able to plan and carry out functions for several thousand people at a time it's a little unnerving.When I was driving home from the luncheon I noticed that my reaction time was off.
Not bad, but it seemed like I was about a second or two off from what I should have been.
I never thought too much about it at the time.Then when my husband came home we went out to play tennis.
And, I noticed my reaction time on the court was really off.
Now sometimes I just don't go race down a shot out of sheer laziness but tonight, my brain didn't even tell my body to run for the ball until after it had bounced -- and then it was way too late.
I've had a few problems before playing tennis but nothing like that.
I hated it because there was absolutely nothing I could do about it -- the brain just didn't work.I don't know what else to say!

it has been so long since I posted.
I have been waiting for my son to "fix" my blog by being able to add comments but he said he had a problem doing it --- that's why it hasn't been done.
I asked him to ask his girlfriend to do it so it might get done -- Ithink she knows more about that stuff anyway -- so hopefully before they go off to California we'll get it done.
However, as I write this I see that there might be a place for comments so he might have done it and now it works.
After I push the button to "publish this" I guess we'll see if a comments area comes up.
If not, stay tuned!We went white water rafting a few weeks ago.
I was dreading it because it was class IV and V rapids.
I've never done anything like that before (highest I've ever gone is Class III and only one or two of them) -- but the trip wasn't too bad.
We never fell out of the raft and that was a good thing.
The bad thing was that I hurt in places I didn't know you could hurt the next day.Then we took a train ride through the Blue Ridge Mountain area.
It was a three hour trip and went through Tennessee and Georgia.
We had done our rafting in South Carolina so we got around a bit those few days!Today Alan and I went to a Braves games despite the heat we are having -- but it wasn't too bad.
After about an hour and a half we were in the shade so we survived and the Braves won.Last weekend Alan his dad and Jennifer painted his room.
Then we had new carpet put down.
The house was a mess for several days and it really took its toll on me.
Things were not in the right spot and I got really confused.
Alan's stuff was all over the house and it was so confusing to me that I had a few pretty rocky days until it was finished.
Now the house is somewhat back to normal and I am feeling better.
I was close to having severe panic attacks with everything strewn all over the house.I have lots of Alzheimer's stuff to go over with you -- but need to save it for the next post.
Thanks to all of you that read this and give me your support -- it means a lot to me.

<doc date=Monday, July 11, 2005>
Well we made it back from Hilton Head.
The weather was hot but we still managed some tennis, swimming (pool and ocean) and bicycling around the island.
Alan and Jennifer also ventured into the waters with a kayak.It was nice to get away but it is always nice to get home as well.
The trip was much harder for me than I thought it was going to be.
And mostly, because things were new to me.
We stayed in a villa for the week and of course, everything was different.
I found it extemely difficult to work in the kitchen -- I had to ask for help several times.
I was just so confused because I didn't know where things were and where to put them back when I got them out, etc.
etc.
Also, Hilton Head was a lot busier in general than we had remembered it.
There were  a lot more people and a couple of times, I found myself very close to a panic attack because there were so many people around and I was in a strange place.Sometimes when we go on vacation I like to venture out on my own.
But I couldn't do that either on foot, bike or by car because I was so confused by my surroundings.
I hate it when that happens!
Luckily, my family was by my side and didn't leave me alone too often.We have a few more two and three day trips left for the summer but they shouldn't be too bad.
Then, we'll be packing Alan up for the drive to California.
What fun that will be.

I didn't realize it had been so long since I posted here.
Sorry about that -- not really much happening I guess.
I've been trying to stay ahead of the curve with the Memory Walk stuff and so far I've been doing o.k.
with it.
We are only a few months away from it and we still have lots to do.We'll be vacationing next week at Hilton Head and I'm looking forward to getting away.
It has been at least 10 years since we have been down there.
I don't really know why I should be looking forward to it as much as I am -- since I used to look forward to vacations to get away from work!
I guess I'm interested in a change of scenery.Alan has promised he is going to redo this blog site before he leaves for Stanford.
He is going to add a place you can add comments to it.
I'm not sure that is a good thing or not!
Sometimes the comments might not be too good -- in fact, a few weeks ago a lady told me that "the only reason you speak out about your Alzheimer's is so that people will feel sorry for you".
That upset me terribly and I haven't told anyone about that until now.
I hope that isn't what everyone thinks because if it is I need to stop now!

The heat has continued here in the south.
But, it looks as if it is going to cool down to the lower or mid 80's by the weekend.
Alan and I have been playing some golf, I'm getting pretty frustrated with it all.
Can't seem to find my swing.
But, I guess I just have to play through it.It has been nice to have Alan home to help me run errands and the like.
It is hard for me to do on my own sometimes, and having someone with me really helps.
I'm going to miss that when he is gone -- he's spoiling me by being home!We still have lots we want to do this summer and although it is only the middle of June it seems like there won't be enough summer to get everything done.
I guess that always seems to be the case though doesn't it?
</doc>
<doc date=Friday, June 10, 2005>
Well, we jumped from spring to mid summer with the temperatures this week.
It has been in the mid 80's and pretty humid.
But, despite the heat Alan and I managed to get in some golf and tennis.
I keep thinking it is going to help me shed these extra pounds, but so far, I've just sweated a lot!On Monday, I went to Atlanta to do an interview/q&a; type thing with Col. Nimrod MacNair (Mac) and Dr. Neil Shulman (best known for being Doc Hollywood, being portrayed by Michael J.
Fox in the movie -- he is also an author).
Neil's mother passed away a few months ago with Alzheimer's and Mac's wife suffers from the disease.
In many discussions over the last few months with these gentlemen and the director of the Alzheimer's Association, we realized it is important to talk about the disease in "not so frightening" terms -- as Neil uses humor as a technique in teaching medicine as well as his writings.
So, we had some fun and taped about an hour's worth of material.
The Alzheimer's Assn.
is hopefully going to be able to edit in some form that it will be useful to those suffering from the disease as well as those that are caring for their loved ones.
Mac is also organizing a fund raiser for Alzheimer's in the community he is currently living in.
Heather Whitestone (Miss America 1995 (I think) who is hearing impaired) is going to be the featured speaker.
She talks about overcoming diversity in her speeches.
She and Mac have done some other motivational type programs in the past.I know I haven't posted for awhile but I wanted to put something down.
It seems like I am staying busy -- it is nice to be able to spend some time with Alan before he goes to California.
His girlfriend, Jennifer, is in Taiwan for a month.
She has been sending some beautiful pictures back as well as an account of her trip.
Her parents are from Taiwan and she hasn't been over to visit her extended family for about six years.
I'm sure she is seeing a lot of new things.
What a wonderful opportunity.
</doc>
<doc date=Thursday, June 02, 2005>
I feel like I am staying busy all the time, but then when I go back and look at what I did when I said I was "busy" it doesn't amount to much.
The fatigue seems to be getting to me more and more -- just trying to concentrate so much and stay on task.
I think that is why I sometimes don't do things because it just takes too much effort.I have had some bad days recently.
I forgot how to get home one day and had to call my husband for help.
I get more confused around the house and feel as if I am forgetting more things.
I try to stay as focused as I can.I have enjoyed being with Alan this summer although our time is limited with him working in Atlanta  a few days a week.
But he still will "hang out" with me -- we went to play golf a few times last week and we generally enjoy each other's company.
I guess I should speak for myself -- I enjoy his company anyway!
He is anxiously awaiting his trip to California and steadily looking at all the things he has to work out.
His girlfriend is in Taiwan for a month visiting her family and when she returns she too will be looking at what needs to be done for her move to the west coast.It has been raining here for days and that gets to be a little depressing at times.
But, hopefully, the sun will come out tomorrow.

This is going to be a long post so if you don't have a few minutes I would come back to this!Yesterday, my son took me to a conference on Alzheimer's Education.
The speaker was Joanne Koenig Coste and you have probably heard me speak about her book Learning To Speak Alzheimers.
She was a terrific speaker and had some great points about Alzheimer's.
If you are dealing with Alzheimers please go out and buy this book -- it is worth every penny.
When I speak I usually take this book with me and end up giving it to someone at my talks -- it brings this disease down to a patient's perspective and I obviously can't say enough about it.Yesterday, I also recieved word from the Social Security office telling me that I wasn't disabled.
Tell that to my brain!
They basically said that I need to get myself back to work -- which I guess we will appeal in time.
How can it be that three doctors have said I can't work and I take a test from a grad student at UGA and it is deemed that I can work.
That's our government at its best.I haven't written about this experience or really mentioned it to many people but my son thought I should write about it since this journal is really for that purpose.
It has often been said that Alzheimer's is a lonely disease -- and it is kind of hard to explain that.
And, I have said that you certainly know who your friends are as many drop you like a hot potato when they find out that you have Alzheimer's.
The phone stops ringing and many write you off.
When people find out about it they literally stop talking to you as if you are stupid and can't understand what they are saying.
They don't realize that you still have feelings.
I say this only to preface an incident that occured a couple of weeks ago.
I attended a luncheon that was honoring a friend of mine.
I didn't know any of the women sitting at my table, but I did know several others that were at the luncheon.
They came up and spoke to me and we chatted for awhile.
Those at the table were good at making small talk since none of us really knew each other.
Then, a person seated nearby made a comment that she knew who I was -- I was that lady that had to stop working because of Alzheimer's.
I replied that "yes, I was".
At that moment, everyone at the table and near me stopped talking to me -- it was as if I disappeared in a puff of smoke.
It made me so mad.
Luckily the program started shortly after that and it diverted my attention......if someone said I had cancer or heart disease, I doubt they would have stopped talking to me -- it's a shame really.
Now you can understand why my real friends are important to me -- you know who you are and thank you for standing by me!On a lighter note, I haven't really mentioned much about my trip to Illinois to see my brothers and friends.
It was a great trip -- I realize how I can't really travel by myself anymore though so it was great to have Alan along with me.
We always laugh alot when we are together and that is so refreshing.
My world is a lot smaller now and having those around me that can laugh with me is a joy.
I got to catch up with an old friend of mine that used to be a client.
We don't see each other often enough, but he is a great guy and has been a friend for 30 years.
Lunch once a year doesn't seem like enough but we do stay in contact with each other and it is so nice that he still cares about me and I care so much about him.
We have been great friends over the years.
Thanks Dave!My friends Pody and Rick and their daughter Rachel have been friends for just about as long.
We always have a great time together -- Pody actually cooked a meal for us and for Pody that is saying a lot -- her claim to fame is that she can't make jello so her cooking always brings us a chuckle!
But the lunch was great and I think after all these years she has finally learned to cook -- just kidding Pody.
Their daughter Rachel is an attorney in downtown Chicago and she and Alan had a lot to talk about.
We enjoy their company -- I wish we lived closer but they have been great to keep in touch with us.My family is growing with great neices and nephews.
It's fun to be around the little ones and see their moms with the children.
Thankfully, the weather was nice for a great big family picnic and the children got to play outside.
I'm not sure with all the noise they make that I could have taken having them all in the house with us -- but they seem to be doing well and I wish I could see them more often --they grow up fast.I've probably written enough for this post.
Sorry it was so long, but I thought while I was on a roll I would keep going!

My son and I just returned from seeing my family in Illinois.
It is always a lot of fun and we laugh a lot.
I needed that.
I sometimes get the "giggles" and can't stop laughing.
When my son starts to laugh that way it is really hard.
We had a great time, but as usual, it is always nice to get home too.
The trips take a lot more out of me now, because I tire so easily.
And, of course, my routine gets shot to hell so that doesn't make it easier.
But time with my family and friends is important and I need to do it when I can.Tomorrow my son and I are going to Greenville SC to an Alzheimer's meeting.
The lady that wrote the book "Learning to Speak Alzheimer's" is one of the speakers and her book is great -- I would recommend it to anyone dealing with this disease.I have lots more to post but it will have to wait until another time.

<doc date=Wednesday, May 11, 2005>
I finally got caught up with rest and then tomorrow my son and I are going to Illinois to see my family.
It has been a long time since we last visited.
I can't even remember -- but it will be nice to catchup with all my family and my friends that still live in the area.When we return Alan and I are going to Greenville SC to an educational conference on Alzheimer's.
The lady that wrote the book "Learning to Speak Alzheimer's" is the featured speaker.
Her book is great and I look forward to meeting her.
I know our trip will be tiring.
It is harder for me to travel because I get worn out so quickly.
Luckily my family knows this and allows "rest time" for me.
But I am anxious to see everyone.More when I return next week.

My son graduates with his Masters in Public Policy tomorrow from Georgia Tech.
What a nice Mother's Day present!
I'm so proud of him.
I'm glad he'll be home for a few months so I can spend some time with him.
Yes, he'll be working a few days a week, but every summer he has not only worked but been taking classes or doing research.
This will be the only summer for a few more years that he will just be working.
Hopefully, we can go to those baseball games, play golf, tennis or just hang out.
By the time August rolls around he will be ready to leave for the West Coast and start a new chapter in his life.Happy Mother's Day to all those wonderful moms out there!

My husband and I just returned from a Public Policy Forum on Alzheimer's in Washington DC.
I was so glad to see so many people with Early On Set Alzheimer's there -- it is nice to know that you are not alone.
I think we all know it, but it is nice to actually see and talk to others that have this awful disease.The Alzheimer's Association asked me to speak at a forum on Early On Set and I am so happy that the National Office is looking into the ramifications of those diagnosed early.
We have our own set of problems and I am glad to have been a part of it.
There was a lot of energy in the room and I do hope that we can find some solutions to some of our problems.
Thank you for all you are doing.I was disappointed, however, to sit in on the research session only to find that I didn't really hear anything new on the horizon.
The last policy session I went to and listen to those from the NIH and National Institute on Aging, I was impressed with all the strides that had been made.
We all want that miracle drug if you will, but it is a long way away.The conference took a lot out of me.
I've been home for a day now and just found the words to sit down and right something in this blog.
I get tired so easily and it is just harder for me to try to be attentive for three days!
I did manage a nap or two while I was there, but it is extremely exhausting to me -- takes me too long to recover!Thanks to all those I met in Washington for all you do and in helping our cause.
The conference was certainly filled with compassionate people and we need to keep the fight going.

<doc date=Saturday, April 23, 2005>
This has been a busy week -- too busy for me.
After my awful testing on Monday I was pretty run down and as a result didn't have a great week.Next weekend my husband and I will be heading to Washington DC for the National Public Policy Forum for Alzheimer's.
We went two years ago and it was a great event -- although depressing because it hits you smack in the face as to what we are facing -- not that you don't know that -- but when you have alot of people in one conference talking about it -- it can become overwhelming.
But in the long run it does us good to hear what is going on and to catch up on the latest research.
I've been told that about 20% of the people that are at the conference will be Early-On Set people such as myself.
That will be good for me.My son made his decsion about law school this week --he is going to become a "surfer dude" and go to Stanford in California.
I'm glad the decision is behind him and I think he will be happy there.
Selfishly, I was hoping he would pick Harvard because it is closer to us, but we'll just have to be content in visiting him in California -- which isn't all that bad when you think about it!

<doc date=Wednesday, April 20, 2005>
For quite a few months now, I have been in an "exchange" with the Social Security office to try to collect disability.
I've been rejected a couple of times, which, we've been told is pretty normal for the Social Security office.
But, they decided to send me for some neuro-psychological tests this past Monday I guess to assess "my disability".
I've had these tests before and they are difficult but I had to go......so I went.The tests were suppose to last three hours.
They began at 10:00 a.m. and didn't end until five hours later!
We had no lunch break and I had one rest room break.
They kept asking me if I wanted a rest room break but I settled for one during the five hours.
Now, think about it, it is very difficult for anyone to sit and take tests for five hours, let alone someone that has Alzheimer's.
The last time I took these tests (for my original diagnosis) it was done over two sessions both lasting about two hours.
The tests I had done Monday were done at the UGA Psychology clinic and were administered by a grad student.
(My nephew is studying for his doctorate in psychology so I kept envisioning him sitting across the table from me.)
The sessions were videotaped and we were also in a room that had a two way mirror for observation.
I felt like I was in a police precinct (although I have never been in one, it looks like those interrogation rooms from television).
The tests started off with me telling them a little about my condition and the things I could not do.
Then of course, most of the tests were "things I can no longer do" -- like math for example.
I just can't do that sort of thing -- in my head or on paper.
It was all being timed  so I didn't get many answers right.
After doing a bunch of memory tests and sequencing tests they then moved on to vocabulary and general knowledge questions.
I must admit that after about two and a half hours I probably couldn't have told you my name at that point, let alone who Cleopatra was or who the President of the United States was during the Civil War.
Many times when I confessed to not knowing I was prompted for a guess.
I'm sure they thought I was being a smart a** but I wasn't.....I was tired and cranky and just couldn't go on.I'm not stupid......but how do they know I'm not stupid?
These tests are designed to try to find me employment.....I can see them coming back and saying she can work...."she's just stupid".
Alzheimer's certainly makes you feel stupid and many of us fight that all the time.
We have to keep reminding ourselves that it isn't us --- it's the Alzheimer's.
When you're tired it is hard to distinguish the two.I was so exhausted when I got home (and I'm lucky I could get home on my own), that I fell asleep in the chair, couldn't carry on a conversation with my husband, went to bed at 7:30 and slept until 6 the next morning.
The next day I was still dragging and not thinking real clearly.I was talking with someone at the Alzheimer's Association in Atlanta yesterday and relaying this information to them.
When I told her that "they probably just think I'm stupid".....she said that sounded like a title to a book.
And it could be.

I just returned from a trip to Albany Georgia where I spoke to a conference put on by the Alzheimer's Association for Caregivers, some professional, some family members.
There were about 250 people there and I admire each and everyone of those people -- enough can not be said about what these people do for their loved ones in a day's time.
Their unconditional love certainly shines through.
I am always honored when I get a chance to meet them.
I've said before that when I speak to groups I believe it is therapy for me.
After I meet these people I am just in awe.

Yesterday was our 25th wedding anniversary.
I never thought I would ever be married 25 years -- it just seems like a long time -- and it is I guess -- it certainly hasn't seemed that long.
My husband and I enjoyed a nice quiet dinner last night.
Our son sent us a card and a nice letter.
In it he said he didn't think he had ever written us a letter -- which is not true as he went away a few times and actually wrote us a letter but I don't think he remembers.
With the age of email and instant communication I feel like letter writing is a lost art.
But don't we all love to get "real mail" and a letter from our son was a beautiful gift.
It was filled with lots of reflection on his part and he raised some interesting points -- some which need to be addressed before too long and some that he will never understand until he is a parent himelf.
I used to hate it when my mom would say this to me "You'll understand when you have kids of your own" -- but it is oh so true.
Lots of wonderful things have come out of our marriage but our son is the most wonderful thing.
I'm sure that all parents feel that way.My husband --a man of few words -- also sent me a "letter" of sorts --this time electing to use the electronic version of email.
He said some things I would have never expected him to say but they were nice words to read.
Even though we have been married 25 years it is hard for me to figure out what goes on his mind -- for those of you that know him -- you will certainly understand.
He has certainly been good to me and Alan over the years.
I am not sure I have been as good -- but we are still together.
I hate the fact that "Big Al" (Alzheimer's) will be taking more of my time as we continue our journey through life.
My husband didn't marry that and for that I am truly sorry.

I have been extremely busy and of course that throws me out of my routine, so that is my excuse for this week for not entering information in here.
It's not a great excuse but one just the same.My nephew visited us for three days.
He had two conferences in Atlanta -- on consecutive weekends so he came to visit us for a few days in between.
While he was here I had  a talk to give in Dahlonega and he went with me.
It was nice to spend some time with him.
He is 25 years old and we moved here 25 years ago so I never really had a chance to get to know him.
He's a bright kid and studying for his PhD in School Pyschology.
But we had a great time going to Dahlonega and the folks there were so gracious.
When I speak about my Alzheimer's it is really more therapy for me I think than the groups I speak to so I'm always grateful to get the opportunity.Then we took my nephew to meet up with my son in Atlanta and he spent a night with him before his next conference started.
This weekend my nephew will fly back to Illinois late on Sunday and my brother is coming into Atlanta on business on Sunday morning.
Our plan right now is to meet my brother, get my son, catch up with my nephew and all have a meal before my nephew gets on a plane.
It's hard for me to follow -- so I am hoping that someone else is keeping track of all of this!As I write this my son is at the University of Chicago Law School for their admitted students weekend.
He went to Harvard's and last weekend he went to Stanford's.
It is down to these three and I feel that a decision will be soon.
I know this is a difficult decision for him and I'm trying to keep out of it -- it needs to be his decision.
That's hard for me to do!Next week is our 25th wedding anniversary.
That is a milestone.
I never thought I would ever be married to anyone that long!
I have another speaking engagement in Albany next week and after that I think I need to rest.
Not being on my routine is difficult and I'll be glad when I can get back to it.
I just have too many bad days when I am not on my routine.

Well it appears spring is here.
We are getting a few days of nice weather, then rain and cold and then a few more nice days.
Hopefully, soon we will see more nice days than cold days!Things have been busy here for me lately and of course that means getting out of my routine and I certainly can feel a difference.
It's hard for me function normally when I am out of my comfort zone.
I'm trying desperately to back to "normal" whatever that means these days but every time I try I get sidetracked.
Over the next couple of weeks I have out of town company  coming and several speaking engagements out of town.
I hope by April 15th I will be able to be back on more of a regular schedule and calm down some.
I get really anxious when things don't follow a routine.
I know I need to be better about controlling and that is something I am going to really have to work on this summer when my son is home.It is hard for me to just do something on the "spur of the moment" like I used to.
I feel uneasy and unsettled and pretty confused.
I know my son will understand when he decides at the last minute he wants to go play tennis or do something that I can't always do it.
I have to plan and stick to my plan -- and I hate that!
I used to be pretty spontaneous and enjoyed just picking up and doing whatever I wanted when I wanted.
So much for that independence!

Well spring is here and hopefully the weather will start acting like it -- we get a few good days and then some bad ones.
But, I guess March is always unpredicatable.There is a lot going on in the next couple of weeks.
My son is in Boston this week checking out Harvard -- heard from him once that he was more impressed with it than he thought he would be.
Not exactly sure what that means, but I know he had some concerns before leaving so maybe those concerns have been cleared up.
The first of April he heads to Stanford and then he is off to Chicago.
We will all be glad when this law school decision is over.
It is very hard!I have several Alzheimer's speeches to give in the next month -- one in Dahlonega, one in Albany and I will be returning to Washington DC for the Public Policy conference.
All of these are so important -- it does me good to do them, but it is also exhausting and makes me realize all the challenges ahead.
I'm usually pretty good at blocking them out (I think that is the survival instinct) but when I do the talks it hits home even more.
It is harder for me to travel by myself and I know that limits what I can do for the cause.
I hate to ask people to go with me because I see it as an inconvenience, but I know people would go if I ask.
I guess I might have to get over that!My nephew will be visiting in a few weeks.
He has two conferences to attend in Atlanta on two consecutive weekends, so during the week he will be able to spend some time with us.
And, my brother is going to visit a day or so in the next few weeks as he is close by on business.
It's going to be a busy time.

Gosh -- it's been awhile I know, but I think I am finally getting back on track after being sick for several weeks.
I just have to watch it and not over do now or I'll be back in the same situation!
Thanks to all those that have called since I haven't been blogging.
I guess I don't realize how many people actually read this.Getting back to my routine is important now to help me keep on track.
I'm doing pretty well, but then I haven't ventured out much lately!My son is in the final stages of selecting law schools.
It is such a difficult decision for him.
He applied to way too many schools, but then he wasn't sure if he would get in them so you have to have your bases covered.
He has it narrowed down to four Stanford, Harvard, Yale and the University of Chicago.
He will be visiting all of them in the next month so hopefully in a month's time he will be able to make a decision.
It will be hard for me to have him farther away than an hour as he has been for the last four years.
I promise to write more soon.
Thanks again for checking up on me.

It has been a busy week for me and a long one!
I went to the Southern part of Georgia this week for an Alzheimer's conference which focused on our annual Memory Walk.
Many of the Walks around the state were represented and it was good to learn and hear what they are doing in their communites.
We have a big goal set for us this year but I know that we can make it.But, these people are phenomenal.
They give and they give and they give.
What they have accomplished with their walks in their communities is unbelievable to me.
The world is such a better place with individuals like that.
I am indebted to them for all they do on behalf of the Alzheimer's cause.
Today, our family is being interviewed for a documentary about Alzheimer's.
I know this is not something that my husband in particular is fond of doing because he is pretty soft spoken.
But, it means a great deal to me that he is willing to do it.
He always does extremely well, although when people interview him, it is hard for me to be in the room.
I realize what a burden I am and that always makes me sad.

I always tell people that I have "good days and bad days" -- and I realize that they don't really know what that means -- but it gets me through the question without a lot of conversation.
But, yesterday -- I had a bad day and what that really means is:1.
I have an electric toothbrush and when I was brushing my teeth yesterday I couldn't remember how to turn the toothbrush off!
It sounds funny now, but I just didn't have a clue.
I ended up putting it in the kitchen sink because I was afraid if I put it on the counter that the vibration would knock it on the floor.
So, I put it in the kitchen sink.
I also couldn't remember where I was suppose to spit out the toothpaste -- so I went to the trash can and spit it out there.
Later, I saw the toothbrush in the sink and thought "why is the toothbrush in the sink and it is turned on?"
I picked it up and turned it off, cleaned it off and put it away.2.
I then had a dentist appointment.
The day before I had broken my glasses and made an eye doctor's appointment to be sure my prescription was still the same before ordering new glasses.
But the whole time I was at the denists getting my teeth cleaned I thought I was at the eye doctor's.
I couldn't figure out why this lady was messing around with my mouth, when they should be looking at my eyes.
It was obviously very confusing.3.
On the way home from the dentist there was an accident and all the traffic was stopped for a long time.
I couldn't maneuver my way around it and couldn't make a u-turn because of the other traffic.
So, I just sat with my engine idling.
I noticed that a lot of people were turning off their engines to wait it out.
I thought I would do the same, however, I thought to myself that if I turned the engine off, I wasn't sure I could remember how to turn the engine back on and then what would I do?
I didn't want to call anyone and ask them because I just couldn't bring myself to do it, so I just sat with my car idling until the wreck was cleared up and then I was on my way home.All these things happened in one morning...and that is a bad day.

<doc date=Wednesday, February 16, 2005>
The last few days haven't been real good days for me.
The only way I can describe it is that I feel like I am a step behind in everything I am doing.
Things don't seem to come into focus for me and I can't quite get right what I am trying to do.
One of the problems I have now is expressing myself clearly as to what I am feeling and I realize that what I just wrote probably doesn't make sense -- only to me.
It just seems like I am out of sync with what is going on around me.
Kind of like I am going in slow motion as the rest of the world whizzes by.
But, this too shall pass.....or I hope so.My friends still keep me going.
I enjoy hearing what everyone is doing and all of the accomplishments.
A good friend from Illinois just got a teaching job in England next fall and that is so terrific.
She always amazes me at what she does and what she has accomplished....I am so excited for her.
It is so nice when great things happen to great people.

Well, it is February and I realized I haven't posted in here for awhile.
Sorry about that everyone!
I've had a cold -- and although I have had it for a couple of days it seems like I have had it for weeks.
It's the kind of cold where you just want to sleep it off!
But, I'm out of the bed today for a little while anyway.
I have a Memory Walk Meeting this afternoon so I need to at least get myself cleaned up and out of the house for that.
I can rest the next two days!
Our group that is working on the Memory Walk is great -- they are pretty much the same people that worked on it last year.
The bad thing is that I hate to commit myself to too much out in the future because I never know how much I'll be able to do in 6 or 9 months time.
You want to hope that you'll be able to do everything.....but you just can't count on it.
But, since we have so many good people on the committee I know it will go off without a hitch as it did last year.
On the home front my son is still agonizing over law schools and probably will for a few more months.
On a lighter note for him, he went to Mardi Gras in New Orleans over the weekend.
I guess I need to clarify what "going to Mardi Gras" really meant in his case.
One of his roommates works for Delta so they got some cheap air fare to New Orleans.
They left on Sunday morning around 9 a.m., stayed up all night and then got on a plane early Monday morning to come back to Atlanta.
So, they weren't there for even 24 hours but I guess they got to "experience Mardi Gras" if that is what you call it!
I guess it would be nice to be young again and do that.
It would take me about a month to get over a trip like that!
On February 14th my son has an audition in Atlanta for the game show Jeopardy.
It is something he has always wanted to do -- why not go for it I guess.
He's a lot braver than I would be.
He thinks that if he can get on the show it will help pay for law school.
I would like to think that, too!

The south was hit hard by an ice storm this weekend.
We lost our power on and off but there weren't many major power outages in our area which was good.
But, it made for a long weekend since it was hard to get out and move around.
But, it was beautiful outside looking at the ice on the trees and the streets.
I know that might sound kind of strange but it was pretty.
The highlight of my weekend was that my son came home.
Luckily he made it home before the ice starting forming.
I really enjoy our time together and it is nice that he spares a weekend here and there because he is so busy.
I worry alot about when he comes home what changes he sees in me if any.
I also worry about the time when he is going to come home and I won't recognize him.....I hope that is a long way away.....but I can't help worry just the same.
That's going to become a reality at some point....as hard as that is to think about.

I know since I have posted here.
I haven't quite figured out what I want to write about these days.
Alot is going on and then it seems like nothing is going on!
I guess after the holidays everything seems to "quiet down", or at least get back to normalcy.
I've started going to the gym on a regular basis and that has gotten me into my routine once again.
I realize how easy it is for me to do too much in a days time and I certainly pay the price sometimes.
I still get tired rather easily and that is frustrating.
My son is looking at law schools and of course all of them are far away.
That has been on my mind a lot -- I know he will make the right decision as to where to go -- he's a smart kid.
So far he has been accepted to Stanford, Berkley and Harvard.
He is still waiting to hear from others -- I wish it was an easy decision for him but I know it won't be.
Of course, mom and dad stress out about it too, but isn't that to be expected!

<doc date=Sunday, January 09, 2005>
I've been pretty frustrated lately.
It goes in spurts thank goodness.
I'm forgetting more and more things -- like going to make coffee and I already made it, going shopping and not remembering what I bought, putting clothes away and not knowing where I put them, filing papers away and not being able to find them.
It's very frustrating.
I feel so stupid when I do stuff like that.
My husband's solution is "write everything down" -- but you cannot write every step down you take during the day.
We do tend to keep things in the same places all the time which helps but sometimes I just want to scream!!!

Hope everyone had a good holiday season.
It has been different for me --not working during this time of the year.
My son has been home from college for three weeks now and I have gotten to spend a lot of time with him.
It's been good -- but different.
I'm sure he finds it boring around the house spending it with the parents, but I'm glad he has done it.
I have a feeling these days will be few and far between from here on out.
I was reminded this week that 2005 brings some milestones for our family.
In April our 25th wedding anniversary comes around, my son will be graduating with his Master's degree in May, my husband is looking at retiring this summer and I will turn 50 in October!
I hope my health will keep up with me so I can see all these things happen!

Our family just returned from a short stay in New York.
It was great fun.
We got to see some shows and enjoy New York during Christmas.
All the Christmas lights made the city sparkle.
It was cold -- but we were only there for a few days so we could take it!
It was so nice to spend time as a family.
At times, things were a little confusing for me, but I still managed o.k.
I realize our "family time" is going to be more and more limited, both in terms of my health and the fact that my son is getting older and won't want to go with his parents on vacation.
But so far, he has managed to tag along and tolerate us having our family time.
The best part of all is always the ice skating part.
I love to ice skate and my son laced up some skates and skated with me at Rockefeller Center.
It was just great.
I have always loved to skate and it doesn't matter how cold it is or what the conditions are, I just love to skate.
I guess growing up in Illinois helped with that as most Southerners don't seem to appreciate it as much as I do.
We had very little bickering on this trip.
Not that we usually have a lot but there always seems to be those times when we argue over where we are going to eat, what we are going to do, how to get there, etc.
But, for some reason this trip was good in that regard.
It's strange that I think about that -- but I'm glad we didn't have that on this trip.
It was a nice holiday present for me -- time with my family -- that's what I like most.

Last week my husband and I went to a one day conference on Alzheimer's in Atlanta.
It was really interesting and we got to catch up on the latest news in what is happening with research and the like.
But, it was the first time since I retired that I was in a "classroom" situation, listening and having to pay attention.
I was amazed at how bad I was at this!
I couldn't follow a lot of what was being said and I thought my head was going to explode after a couple of hours.
I'm glad I don't have to concentrate for long periods of time anymore!
It's a couple of weeks before Christmas and here in the south it is still quite warm.
Our family is going to New York City next week just to "play" and it is suppose to be cold there -- I'm glad of that -- perhaps it will get us into the spirit of Christmas a little more.
And, I love to ice skate so I am looking forward to skating in Central Park and at Rockefeller Center.
It is so beautiful there with the Christmas tree and everything.
I'm glad I will get to enjoy this with my family.
That is what the holidays is really about -- spending time with the people you love.
And, unfortunately, missing the ones you can't be with.

Several years ago I met a couple of women who are big Kenny Rogers fans.
They contacted me when our venue was hosting Kenny Rogers for a two night concert.
Their names are not Thelma and Louise but I started calling them that because they have such a zest for life and a little crazy -- I say that affectionately.
When I started calling me them that they didn't even know who Thelma and Louise were so they watched the movie and called me and said "But we didn't kill anyone!"
-- which is true of course, but they still remind me of Thelma and Louise.
Last night I went to a Kenny Rogers concert with Thelma and Louise in Atlanta.
It is my second concert with them.
Last night marked their 896th concert of Kenny Rogers -- yes, 896.
It is rather amazing -- and they love him more today than they did years ago when they started going to concerts.
Thelma and Louise are sisters and this is their passion (obviously) -- but they are so happy when they are doing it -- I can't imagine being that happy over something you have seen 896 times!
But that is what makes life interesting -- those types of people and thank God for them.
I love these women -- they have become friends in a short time.
I wish I had their enthusiasm for life!

Tomorrow is Thanksgiving.
It is amazing how time flies isn't it?
My son is coming home tonight and staying for a few days.
That always seems to cheer me up.
I'm grateful he takes time for his family and always has.
This hasn't been a real good week for me.
And, the bad thing is that when I have a bad time, it is very difficult for me to find the right words to tell somebody about it.
Usually my husband picks up on it and helps me along but he hasn't been doing that lately -- I think he is just missing the cues.
But, I can't tell him about it because I can't find the right words to express myself.
Never having had a problem with expressing myself before, this makes it even more difficult to deal with.
I guess it goes back to the "aloneness" of Alzheimer's -- you feel so alone because you can't communicate effectively.
I guess the upside to that is that if I can't tell anyone that I'm having a problem I'm less of a burden!
Hope everyone has a great Thanksgiving.

Gosh -- next week is Thanksgiving.
The time certainly flies.
We have finally finished up pretty much everything on our Memory Walk and we brought in almost $30,000.
We are so pleased with the effort...and the good thing is everyone is on board again for next year.
This committee of ladies that worked on the event this year were so great and caring.
I just hope that I will be able to help in some capacity -- I hate to make too many committments too far out because I don't know what kind of shape I'll be in at that time.
The holidays mean more to me now and I know that everyone says that we take everything for granted.....and we do.
That is a real shame isn't it?
It seems like something bad has to happen in order for you to realize that.
And, I really don't want presents I want time with my friends and family.
That is the most important thing to me.

Well, our Memory Walk is history.
The day was truly amazing.
Seeing all those people come together for our cause was very touching and humbling to me.
We had hoped for about 300 people and we came close to that.
The Alz.
Office is counting our money but we are hopeful that we reached our $20,000 goal.
The weather turned out great and the walk was awesome.
I can't thank everyone enough for the hours they put into making this happen along with everyone who donated money.
Thanks to all of you reading this that made that happen!
One thing that struck me is that strangers called me during the week after seeing the publicity in the paper and asked if they could come out and volunteer.
I know people volunteer all the time but to have people just call, without knowing anyone else or doing it with a group is amazing to me.
Maybe I don't give people enough credit -- because like I said, I know people volunteer all the time, but it usually a case where they are tied to the cause or have family or friends involved and they want to help.
But that wasn't the case with some of those that showed up to work today -- they just wanted to help.
One of my friends had surgery on her foot and she came to the walk in a motorized wheelchair so she could "walk" with us.
The funny thing about it is, that she had the surgery two weeks ago and never told me.
We talk on the phone but we don't see each other very often.
She didn't tell me because she knew that I was working hard on the walk and she knew (or she thought anyway) that I would be over there helping her and worrying about her and not working on the  Memory Walk.
You can imagine how surprised I was when she showed up in a wheelchair.
That's friendship.
And, that's friendship you don't find real often.
I am truly fortunate to have such wonderful people in my life.
My friends and family pitched in where ever they saw something that needed to be done and I cannot express my gratitude enough.
When we find out how much money we raised I will let you know.
Thanks again for your love and support.

I hope everyone is planning to vote next week -- or if you get the chance to vote early as some states have that option.
It's important to vote -- please do!
Our Memory Walk is in a little over a week.
Things are picking up and I am so appreciative of everyone's efforts for the Walk.
Since it is the first time the walk is going to be in our town in several years, we are hoping for a nice showing.
We hope to build from this first year.
This week I spoke to a support group in a neighboring town.
I am always so impressed with the groups that I speak with.
This group has dealt with Alzheimer's in a very personal way by caring for those with the disease.
I admire them so.
I have said before that I think this disease is much harder on the care givers than those of us that suffer with the disease.
We all have our problems, but the patience these people possess is amazing.
Thank God for those people.

Well, I said I would be better about writing in here but I realize it has been a couple of weeks.
Sorry about that.
I have been busy with the Memory Walk and working for my friends House campaign.
It has been fun, but exhausting.
I have probably taken on more than I can handle but in a few short weeks it will be over and then I am not taking any new projects on until after the first of the year -- if then!
I had our Memory Walk team over for a cook out last week and it was nice to get everyone together.
They have all worked so hard in collecting money for the walk.
It means so much to me and there will never be a way I can thank them adequately for going above and beyond.
The walk will be good this year.
It will be smaller than I think we wanted it to be but I might be surprised.
The newspaper is doing a feature story on the walk on November 2 (election day -- be sure to vote) so I hope that raises some awareness of the walk as well.
My son turned 21 this week.
Turning 49 didn't bother me much -- but now I feel really old since he is 21.
He has turned out pretty well and we are proud of all he does.    
</doc>
<doc date=Saturday, October 09, 2004>
Today is my 49th birthday.
It has been a rather emotional day -- upon waking this morning I received word that a dear friend had passed away from pancreatic cancer.
We knew that it wouldn't be long for her but it is still difficult.
Earlier in the week, a business associate that I had worked with for over 15 years passed away with cancer.
His memorial service is tomorrow.
Just about a month ago I was faced with two others passing away within a week of each other.
I'm much more emotional than I used to be so these types of things hit me harder than I expect them to.
But, the bright side of my day was that my boy came home from college to surprise me for my birthday -- that is all I wanted for my birthday was to see my son -- and I didn't think it was going to happen for a lot of reasons.
But, it did, and that made me very very happy.

Have you ever had a panic attack?
It is not a fun thing.
I've been experiencing some lately and it is awful.
I remember a long time ago talking to someone with early on set Alzheimer's and she told me that she couldn't leave the house or get around a lot of people because she would get panic attacks.
I had them years ago and they went away -- now I guess they're back although not too bad!
What fun life is.
The weather has started to turn cooler here and it so nice to be outside.
I also feel like working around the house a little more -- you don't get so hot.
I realize how much I have neglected the house over the years -- I'm glad my husband was there to pick up the slack.
I'm going to try to do better.
If I could accomplish one big chore a day it would be great -- but I haven't been that ambitious.
Back to the doctor today for my three month check up.
I suspect everything will be o.k.
-- we'll see.

<doc date=Tuesday, September 28, 2004>
Yes, it has been almost a month since I wrote in this blog -- thanks to the many that have reminded me in the last few weeks.
I always think that what I write in here is so negative that people don't want to read it...so I'll try to be better.
I am working on our Memory Walk -- it has been a bit of a struggle getting everyone to buy into here in Athens.
It is different than most of the "walks" in Athens, because most people just register the day of, pay their $10 or $15 to walk and it is over.
Since this is more of a fund raising issue, it doesn't work quite that way and it is just getting people to change their mind set.
It will turn out fine -- it is just change for many people.
I have 15 or so people on my team this year and that is good.
I hope collectively we can raise $3,000.
Last year we raised over $2,000.
However, many of the people on my team are forming their own teams this year since the walk is in Athens, so we may have to try a little harder.
I go back to the neurologist next week.
Hopefully he will think I am doing better -- I certainly feel a lot better by not working.
I feel like I can contribute a little more to home life these days.
A lady in Atlanta called me this weekend -- she is 53 and was just diagnosed.
She still works and is doing well -- she really just wanted to find out a little more about my situation and what she thought she might be facing.
She feels that she can continue to work for awhile and that is good as long as she can do it.
I'm going to quit for now, but I promoise -- cross my heart -- to be back more often.

I know that I have discussed how much I enjoy playing tennis and how at times it is hard because of all the noise on the courts.
People talking and yelling distract me and it is hard to focus on the game at hand.
Well, about a week and a half ago, I was out playing tennis with my husband and something a little different happened to me.
I was playing and I could not figure out what I was doing out there.
I was getting mad because all I knew was that my husband was on the other side of the court hitting balls at me.
I was trying to bat them down because I didn't want them to hit me -- I was totally unaware that I was out there to play a game -- I just couldn't figure out why my husband was hitting balls at me.
Then I looked around at the other courts and saw the same thing happening on the courts and couldn't figure out why people would intentionally be hitting balls at each other because someone was going to get hurt!
After about ten or fifteen minutes I just broked down crying on the court because I couldn't understand why my husband would want to hurt me by hitting balls at me.
After a time out on the court for me to cry I regrouped, figured it out and when on to play.
And, after my husband played easy on me for a few games, I ended up beating him -- but he really won -- because he had to put up with me!

<doc date=Tuesday, August 17, 2004>
The week started off kind of quiet with the son off to college.
I am always sad when he leaves (even though it is quieter) and even though he is only a little over an hour down the road at school it seems like he is a lot farther away.
I can't imagine when he goes off to law school next year what that will feel like.
I always worry about how he will see me the next time he comes home -- will he notice changes in me, will he be surprised with what he sees?
I guess I worry too much.
There's not much he can do about it anyway.
I think I have somewhat of a routine going these days.
I'm better in the morning and since I have always been a morning person that is probably a good thing!
So, getting errands and such done in the morning and settling into "home" things in the afternoon seems to work for me right now.
Things come up that throw me off but I seem to be doing o.k.
with everything for the moment.
One thing I have noticed lately is that talking on the telephone is a little more difficult for me.
It's not the talking part, it is taking what the other person is saying, understanding what they are saying and putting the right words together for a response.
I am sure that sometimes the person on the other end thinks I'm not paying attention, but it takes me longer to put into words what I want to say.
I tend to lose the flow of the conversation if it is a long one and then I know my answers probably don't make much sense.
I ask a lot of questions on the phone,probably repeating myself several times in the process.
I remember before I was on my medication I asked those that I worked with that the preferred method of communication with me now was either putting a note in my box or email.
That way I could go back and look at it several times if I needed to.
It's hard to do that with a conversation.

Last week my son and I did a radio interview.
It turned out really well.
Leeza Gibbons was on with us and she was talking about her Leeza's Place that she has started.
She was very delightful and she was very accommodating.
She stayed with us for the whole hour and that was not something I was expecting her to do.
Today, as I write this Fox 5 from Atlanta is here doing an interview on our family.
They are actually shooting me typing this.
The interviews are hard and although they can sometimes seem effortless it takes a lot of energy out of me and I know my family when doing these.
Sometimes we don't like to talk about the disease because it is not always pleasant to talk about -- but I know we have to for everyone's sake -- it is just not that easy to do sometimes.
I have thrusted my family in the spotlight for two years now and they don't seem to mind.
My husband is particularly shy so I know that it is a stretch for him, but he does it.
He knows how important it is to spread the word.
Many have asked about my retirement and how it is going.
It certainly is different but I am enjoying not having to work the long hours and deal with the stress.
I still have my moments, though.
I'm trying to work myself into a routine.
And, my friends are pretty good about not "overdoing it" on me.
I get lots of calls to do things but when I have to say no because I'm just not up to it my friends know that it is because I have a hard time with it on that day and it isn't a reflection on not wanting to do things with them.
I hope they keep remembering that!
My friends get me through my tough days and it is great to know they are out there when I need them.
Alan goes back to school this weekend.
It is going to be strange not having him around -- but then it will certainly be more quiet!

Tomorrow my son and I are doing a local radio show.
I have done the show on numerous occasions some about my job, but the last two years I have been on to talk about Alzheimer's.
Tomorrow will be my son's first time on a radio program.
He has stepped out in the limelight on my disease with television and newspaper reporters, but not radio.
I'm proud of him for doing it -- he knows how important it is and I appreciate it.
Also on the program with us tomorrow will be television personality Leeza Gibbons.
She has started "Leeza's Place" for those with Alzheimer's.
Her grandmother passed away with the disease and now her mother has it.
I don't know what it must be like to be children of those with the disease and wondering whether they will get it or not.
I know how bad I feel thinking that I may have passed this on -- but the question out there remains whether you want to know or not.
There are pros and cons to both sides of that story.
I am enjoying my retirement.
Of course, as I have probably stated before, I have to be careful to pace myself.
So far, I'm doing pretty good.
I am taking time to do some things around the house but one of the most important projects that I am doing is re-doing photo albums and scrapbooking.
It takes a lot of time but I want to do these things for my son in particular.
I'm beginning to forget more and more and I want to capture the memories while I still have them.

<doc date=Wednesday, July 28, 2004>
So far, retirement is pretty good.
I love not having to get up in the morning and get dressed for work.
I still get up early out of habit, but it's nice to know that I don't have to.
I'm enjoying my peaceful time at home.
People keep asking me what I am doing to stay busy, because if you know me, you know that I am always doing something.
However, that has changed.
I'm not the same person anymore.
My personality has changed and of course my thought processes have changed as well.
I don't need to be busy every second of every day.
That is why I retired.....to have some time to be able to deal with life.
I honestly do not know how I worked every day -- I know I wasn't keeping up, but the energy it took was so exhausting.
I didn't realize how tired I was until I stopped working.
My life is different now.
It's hard for people to understand that about me.
But that is o.k., they don't have to.
I do have a few projects I am working on and I have had to tell a lot of people "no", which I didn't used to do.
But I know my limits -- I can't do the things I used to do -- eventually others will figure this out as well.
I want to do as much as I can, but that is a lot different than what it used to be.
I have a lot of friends that are concerned about me in my retirement.
Right now I'm doing fine and it makes my happy that they care about me.

A friend of mine passed away last week.
She had been ill for a long time -- in and out of remission of a disease.
She was one of the first people that we met when we moved here almost 25 years ago.
Her memorial service was today and I sat there hoping that when it comes to be my turn that it will be as nice.
She had a lot of friends that loved her.
She was only 54 years old.
That's sad.
I was also reminded at the service how my memory is fading.
There were so many people there and I couldn't remember their names or realize how I should know them.
That has always been one of my strong points and that is something I am going to have to get used to.
The medication I am on has been good at helping but I know it isn't the cure!
Don't I wish that it was.

Well it has been so long since I wrote in here, that I went to edit my post and found that I had deleted it, so I had to start all over!
I am officially retired now and since it hasn't been but two weeks since this has happened I only feel like I am on vacation.
I'm sure that will change shortly!
I went back to the doctor last week and he wants me to increase my medicine a little.
That is always a bummer.
And, it will be important for me to establish a routine now that I am home.
That might be the most difficult thing for me to do!
We went on a short vacation to Toronto last week.
It was nice getting away with the family.
It does really exhaust me because I have to be so attentive all the time and it really wears me out.
I did get pretty confused on the subway, tram and bus system, but that is what my family is for these days -- to help me maneuver.
We did have a great time and the trip was just long enough.
It is so important we do these trips because I'm not sure how long I will be able to travel like that.
I promise to be better about putting in some posts -- now that I am a lady of leisure!

I know I wrote in here a few weeks ago that I was dreading my retirement party.
Well, the party was yesterday and it turned out great.
It was a little overwhelming but I got through it.
I think my biggest surprise is that my brother travelled from Illinois to be here to surprise me.
My son knew that he was coming but I didn't.
I was so surprised.
The staff at work did a good job in keeping it low key and not a lot of speeches.
It was truly a humbling experience seeing all the folks that came out to wish me well.
It was awesome.
I will write more later.

It's been said many times that Alzheimer's is a disease of loneliness.
Loneliness in the sense that others don't realize what you are going through, loneliness in the sense that people around you don't know how to act or react so they don't and loneliness in the fact that you feel all alone -- no one can really do anything to help you.
If you were ever the last one picked in gym class you can probably understand this.
I see my friends and family going on about their lives and I can't participate or I sense they don't want me to because I can't contribute.
I don't blame them...they aren't being cruel....it's just life these days.  
</doc>
<doc date=Sunday, June 06, 2004>
died yesterday at the age of 93.
He had Alzheimer's.
I was always kind of indifferent to President Reagan never really feeling one way or another about him.
When he announced 10 years ago he had the early stages of Alzheimer's, I remember feeling sorry for his family and wondering what they would have to go through in the years ahead.
Needless to say, his death has had a bigger impact on me than I thought it would.
I don't think I need to say anymore.
On a lighter note, some friends came from Illinois to see us this week.
They drove the 12 hours or so, stayed a day, went to Atlanta for a day and drove home.
That's friendship.
It means so much to me that I have friends like that.
It's hard for me to see them leave because I don't know when I will see them again or if by the time I do see them again whether I will remember them or not.
So, I try to cherish the time I have with everyone not knowing what lies ahead.
As retirement approaches at the end of this month, my list of things I want to do grows longer.
That's probably a good thing.

I know.
This is getting more and more difficult to write.
It's not that I don't have things to share it is just I don't think anyone would find them interesting!
It's Memorial Day Weekend and things are kind of quiet.
I have one more month to work with only one more major concert to do.
You have no idea how much I am looking forward to at least getting this last concert done!
It's getting so hard to do and I just want it to be over.
In a little more than a week it will be and hopefully with not many problems.
On a brighter and much more different note, there will be an Alzheimer's Memory Walk in Athens this year.
A lovely individual has stepped forward to organize it and I hope I can be of some help.
I have wanted to do one here but knew that I couldn't organize it.
It's a massive undertaking and we are fortunate to have a lot of peole step forward to help.
It will be Saturday, November 6th and I'm looking forward to it.

OK -- I started logging into this Blog page to write something and they have changed the whole format of how you do things.......and then expect me to understand it.
So, I'm hoping this posts o.k.
-- change is not a good thing for someone with Alzheimer's.
Yes, it has been awhile since I posted.
Finally getting back to somewhat of a routine after Alan's graduation.
He hasn't been home much since he graduated because he has been working alot.
But, it sure is different with another person around the house when you are not used to it.
It is hard for me when he and his dad are talking and the television is on -- I can't filter through everything and it sounds like just lots of loud noises in my head.
My office wants to give me a retirement party at the end of June.
That is really bothering me.
All the people, all the emotions, all the fuss.
I just want to "go quietly into the night", but that isn't going to happen.
These kinds of things are very dfficult for me and it will be hard.
I know I am obsessing about it and I need to stop thinking about it because it is a month away.
I was hoping to influence the party someway that it could be very low key but I think it is getting out of hand.
More on that later I'm sure.

<doc date=Wednesday, May 05, 2004>
I know it has been awhile since I entered something in here.
My son's college graduation was this weekend and my two brothers from Illinois came down for it.
It was awesome to see them and I am so glad they could come.
I don't spend a lot of time with them, but when I enter retirement I am hoping that I will be able to visit them more often.
But, the weekend was pretty tiring for me.
I actually "did pretty well" the whole weekend, not getting too confused but I really tried to stay focus most of the time and it is exhausting.
I found going back to work on Monday pretty hard.
That whole "working the mind" stuff didn't go so well.
Since I was tired, I made a lot of stupid mistakes and stayed pretty much in my office and out of harm's way.
I feel like I hibernate most of the time, trying not to venture out of my office much just because it is too difficult to get back on track once I do.
So, I do better in my quiet office, all by myself.
My office wants to have a retirement party for me and I have been fighting it.
I don't want a party but they are determined to have one whether I want one or not.
So, I have decided to give in and I figure that if I can be part of the planning that I can maybe steer it my way -- not too much fanfare.
I just want to go "quietly into the night", but that is obviously not going to happen if I don't have something to say about it.
I have a hard time around a lot of people and I will sometimes feel like a panic attack is coming on because of all the noise and trying to sort everything out.
I just get too confused and I am easily overwhelmed.
I know they know that and will take that into account when planning the party but I am still very uncomfortable about the whole thing.
I certainly don't feel like a deserve a party and just don't want a fuss.
However, I have specifically asked for no one to bring gifts and if people would like to make a donation to the Alzheimer's Association that would be great.......perhaps there is an upside to this!
I know they mean well and I appreciate the thought......I am just not very comfortable with it.
I guess I have about a month to get used to the idea and we'll see what happens.
I'm sure you will be reading more about this as we get closer and I get more anxious!

There's a lot going on in my life right now and it is overwhelming to me.
It's at times like this that I'm not sure my medicine is working, but I know it must be or I probably wouldn't be able to function.
I keep thinking that "once I get past this weekend" or "once I finish this project" I'll feel better and I probably will -- it's just that all of those "things" seem to be coming at me at once.
My son graduates from Georgia Tech this weekend at the top of his class.
And, he did it in three years.
Pretty amazing -- he is a pretty amazing kid.
You can imagine how proud I am of him.
My brothers are coming to visit for the graduation and I'm really happy about that.
On the other hand, I'm nervous because it is out of my routine and I don't do so well with new things.
But having my family around me makes a difference and I can get through one of the proudest moments of my life so far.

Yes, I know it has been awhile.
Writing in this blog is harder than I thought it would be.
I've been thinking alot about change lately.
Change is inevitable I know, but sometimes you don't notice it until it comes at you in big chunks.
Change is sometimes good, sometimes bad.
Change affects many people.
And changes in other people's lives affect our lives.
In the past week and in the weeks and months ahead, these things have or will be happening --- my son will be graduating from college, I will be retiring, a dear friend is moving several states away, another friend has just dealt with a scare from cancer, and another friend is running for political office.
That's a lot of change.

having three days off of work.
I feel so much better when I don't work.
The pressure and the constant "drain on my brain" takes such a toll on me.
We were off on Good Friday and then I had the weekend.
I didn't do much and I probably should have, but I didn't.
On Friday I did run some errands and had a little bit of a hard time doing them myself, but I paced myself and I didn't do everything I wanted to, but I was proud of what I did get done.
They are doing a lot of construction work around our neighborhood and it gets me very confused because everything looks different.
So, I try to avoid that area as much as possible.
It's weird how something that simple can throw me off.
It's back to work now -- only a few more months left.
I'm making more mistakes at work -- that's not a good thing.
I feel like I have enough people watching over what I am doing now that if I do make a mistake someone will catch it.
Let's hope so at least.

I'm "home alone" for a few days as my husband is traveling on business.
It's been awhile since I have been home alone.
I know my husband worries about me while he is gone -- that I take my pills, that I remember to feed the cats, etc.
As long as I stay on my schedule and don't wander from my routine too much I'm o.k.
I don't go far from home though!
I have plenty to keep me busy around the house.
I just hate the thought of anyone having to worry about me.

Last year I went to the Alzheimer's Public Policy Forum in Washington DC.
It was very educational, enlightening but very draining.
It was the first one I went to and it opened my eyes.
The conference was held again last week but I didn't go.
I wanted to, but I know how hard it was for my husband last year to go with me and I wasn't sure I wanted to put him through that again this year.
But, I went on line to see what had happened on the Alzheimer's website.
I am so encouraged with what everyone is doing to help the cause.
On the website there are transcripts of testimonies that people gave that are very touching.
One in particular was from an "email pen pal" of mine, John, who spoke about his lovely wife who was diagnosed with AD and how he has been caring for her and his devotion to her.
What love he has for her and how I admire him.
It's individuals like John that make a difference in this world.

I've always had a passion for tennis.
When I was growing up I was a big tomboy.
My brothers were into all types of sports and I wanted to be too.
They wouldn't let me play baseball with them so I would take my tennis racket and hit the ball against a wall while they played baseball.
I did this for hours -- or so it seemed.
Over the years I have played a lot of tennis.
And, admittedly so, I am a tennis snob.
Hate to lose, love to win, only want to play with good players, etc., etc., etc.
I know how selfish this sounds, but at least I can admit it.
I like to think that I am an EX tennis snob.
I hope so, but I guess you would have to ask someone else to be certain.
Today, I went out and played.
I haven't played in about 6 months.
I was shocked at how bad my concentration level is now.
I know I have mentioned the stuff about how noise bothers me and makes it hard to concentrate.
When I was playing tennis there were people on other courts talking, some children out playing behind the courts and a family pulling a wagon over a wooden bridge.
I couldn't concentrate on hitting the ball.
My brain could not put into place the steps you need to actually hit the ball.
I just had to stop until the noise quieted a little.
I didn't ACT devastated but deep down inside I was.
Another of the things I am passioniate about in my life has become an obstacle.
Of course, I'm not going to quit playing tennis.
I just have to pick quieter times to play.
On a brighter note, my son called from college this week and told us he had won an award at Georgia Tech which is the highest academic honor you can win.
All of those nominated have 4.0 grade averages and then all of the other things they do plays a part in the award.
I'm so proud of him.
It's moments like this that I can share with him that make me the happiest.

Me, my family and my doctor have finally decided it is time for me to retire.
It has been a hard decision to come by but I know that it is best for me.
Not being able to do my job and not being able to have a somewhat "normal" life at the same time has become impossible.
I let the staff where I work know today that I will retire at the end of June.
It gives me a few months to get things in order.
I was going to wait until May to tell them, but rumors began rumbling around the office and I decided that it was better they hear it from me than from rumors.
This is definitely a crossroad in my life.
Having to admit that I can't do my job is hard.
I know that the quality of my life will be much better when I'm not working.
I have accepted it -- it is much harder for those around me to accept.
They don't have to live with this everyday --I do.
And, I know when the idea of it wears a little on them, they, too will know this is the best thing for me.

There was a news clip on NBC tonight about a family that has several members suffering from Alzheimer's.
It's a different family than I have discussed in this blog earlier.
But, they are having testing and research done on their family to see if they can help find a cure.
I wish I could do more.
If I knew what to do I would do it.

I don't "get out" much these days....and it is on purpose.
I used to be the one that always wanted to be on the go, but now I am much more laid back and content on staying somewhere where it is quiet, not confusing, and peaceful.
But yesterday, we went to see my son and his girlfriend and went to see a Broadway show.
It was really great -- I was actually able to follow the story line!
Then we went out to dinner.
At dinner, I excused myself to go to the bathroom and then realized after I was in there that I wasn't sure where I was!
There goes that routine again!
Anyway, after a few minutes of trying to get my bearings I tried venturing out to realize I was in a restaurant.
I located our table and the faces were familiar.
Eventually, I was understanding where I was and what I was doing -- but it is a little scary when those things happen.
Luckily, they don't happen very often!

<doc date=Wednesday, March 17, 2004>
since I have written I know.
I apologize -- but I forgot my password to get into this thing!
So what else is new!
The past few weeks have seemed like a whirlwind to me.
Lots of things have happened and I can't go into detail about them just yet, but hopefully it will calm my life a bit.
Stay tuned.
I spoke to a great group of people this week.
I do a couple of speeches a month usually and I always think it does me more good than it does those I speak to.
The people are really receptive to what I have to say about Alzheimer's and I hope that I am able to put a different face on the disease for them.
It's hard to know what to say....sometimes I think I scare people.....but it comes from my heart and that is all I can do.
I wish I could do more.
Thanks for checking on this site.
I appreciate your comments and your feedback.
I promise to get better about writing on a more frequent basis.

I've been totally useless this weekend.
I've not gotten out of the house but to go to the grocery store.
I don't know why -- but I just didn't feel like doing much.
Some times you just have those days.
I worked around the house but felt pretty useless other than that.
My son comes home for Spring Break this week.
That always perks me up.
He always cheers me up.

I went to the doctor yesterday.
I wasn't having a good day so I had a pretty good feeling that my "tests" weren't going to be real positive.
And, they weren't.
I didn't do very well on my mini mental test he gives me.
It's very frustrating.
I have to cut back on the hours I'm working.
My husband went with me and we discussed my work situation and the possibility of how long I will be able to continue to work.
It's getting much more difficult for me.
I think we have pretty much come to the conclusion that my working days are limited.
That's a hard thing to accept, but there comes a point where you have to embrace it....and I'm pretty close to that.
Sometimes I feel as if the disease is taking hold of my neck and choking me!
I want to choke it right back!
When I got home last night I received a package from a friend of mine, Pody, in Illinois.
It was a scarf that she had knitted for me.
The funny thing about it is that if you knew Pody, the word knitting, would never be used in the same sentence as her name.
However, she has taken up knitting and she sent me a sample of her work.
I really love it and I love the fact that she thought to send it to me.
Friends are great that way -- it seems like they are always there for me when I need them the most -- even when they live far away!

Yesterday was not a good day.
I couldn't remember my cat's name.
I have found that watching movies or reading books is something I don't do well.
I can't keep up with the story line of the movies and I can't remember what I've read from page to page.
It's frustrating.
Last night my husband was watching "The Hours" which is suppose to be a good movie.
I thought I could follow it -- but was lost in the first fifteen minutes.
I'm not very good company when watching movies because I ask a lot of stupid questions.
So I just don't watch.

I'm so unproductive these days.
Work has been really hard this week -- lots of things to deal with outside of the norm -- which of course, throws me off my routine -- and we know what that does.
Staying focused has been extremely difficult.
I have my good weeks and my bad weeks.
I think I'm still trying to recover from the long Willie Nelson day.
My short term memory is getting a little worse.
I know people are noticing more and more but they don't want to say anything to me!

<doc date=Tuesday, February 17, 2004>
It is amazing to me how being tired affects your brain.
I never used to notice this unless I had been going at full speed for several weeks and then things came crashing done on me.
However, since it takes so much energy to concentrate and focus with Alzheimer's, I get tired and totally exhausted a lot quicker than I used to.
We had Willie Nelson in for a show on Sunday night so it was a long day and dealing with everything took its toll on me.
On Monday, I was in meetings all day and today I'm just running on empty.
At least my brain is -- thank God I'm on medication because I cannot imagine what I would be like if I wasn't.

Several people have called me lately to ask me why I haven't written anything in my blog.
The problem is I think of all kinds of things to post here, but then I have second thoughts.
I don't want this to sound so depressing or always talk about the difficulties I face, but that is what is on my mind most of the time.
Work has been extremely hard this week and at one point, I was so confused I wanted to call my husband and ask him to come and get me so I could go home and snuggle up in a warm bed and take a nap.
Nothing was making sense and I didn't know what to do about it.
My brain had turned to jello and it was melting!
Somehow, I regrouped and made it through the day but it was tough.
I've mentioned before that routine is very important to me and I have bad days when my routine is out of kilter.
Having this cast on my foot has definitely changed my routine and perhaps that is contributing to my difficult times of late.
I had a confrontation on the phone with our cell phone provider and I was so confused by what she was saying that I know that I was not getting across to her.
I knew exactly what I needed to say but the words could not come out and I got very frustrated.
The whole situation was frustrating but I felt taken advantage of.
Another instance where I felt this way was when I went into a drugstore to buy a lot of things and I had a bunch of coupons.
When I was being checked out I knew that the clerk had not rung it up properly to take into account my coupons and the sales items, but I couldn't explain it to her.
It was all in my head, but I couldn't get it out properly.
I felt like a senior citizen being scammed by a con artist.
There was absolutely nothing I could do to make the situation right because I didn't have the capability of communicating the right way.
That is also a good reason not to go shopping by myself -- which I don't do very often.
But, I was able to enjoy a weekend with my son home and celebrated my husband's 60th birthday yesterday.
Those are the nice things I hope I can remember.

Well, this week has been the pits.
I can't adjust to having this cast on my foot.
My husband is right in saying that this cast is bothering me much more than it should.
I hate to be dependent on people and I think I'm looking at my future with Alzheimer's and knowing how much more dependent I will be on my family as my illness progresses.
That's not fair to them and there isn't anything I can do about it.
It will be much worse than dealing with someone with a cast on their foot!
The thought of that depresses me greatly.....my family doesn't deserve that.

This month's issue of the in-flight magazine has an article about the Alzheimer's Association in it.
It's a great article --if it had not been for them and their support I'm not sure that I would be doing as well as I am.
If anyone is reading this that has Alzheimer's and has not contacted the association do it now.
There is a link on my page -- it will not only help you but your family as well.
My son is coming home from college this weekend.
I've been really down about this stupid cast on my foot --he always brightens my world when I get to see him.
I know I'll feel much better by Monday.

When I was in the hospital this weekend I had to put on my form "Alzheimer's" when they asked about current medical conditions.
I'd never had to do that before and that is pretty weird.
Anyway, when the doctor came in to see me he said "You have a little bit of early on set Alzheimer's going on, huh?"
I said yes, and he said "Well, you look like its not bothering you too bad" or something to that affect.
How does he know that from just looking at me for 5 seconds before he said it?
I looked awful already -- no make up, didn't mess with my hair, had just gotten up in the morning and then he said that.
Most doctors don't have a clue what you go through when you have Alzheimer's.
Many Alzheimer's patients complain about people saying "you look great --you must be doing great".
That really wears thin after awhile.
I know they mean well and they don't know what to say.
But......  As you can tell, I'm probably not having a good day.

I had to go to the hospital this morning.
It's a short story.....my foot started to hurt mid-week and by this morning it really hurt.
Decided to go to the hospital to have it checked out only to come home with a cast on my foot -- a stress fracture.
A couple of weeks on crutches and then we'll see.
But, I was really confused at the hospital.
I was so glad Ralph was with me.
I was able to answer all the questions but I know if Ralph had not been with me I would have had a panic attack or I guess if truth be known if Ralph hadn't been around I probably wouldn't have even gotten to the hospital would I?
I'm so grateful for my husband, my family.....and friends.

I've certainly been in a funk lately.
I have no desire to do anything .....don't want to go to work, don't want to get out of bed, don't want to socialize, nothing.
I'm sure it is depression but I hate it when this happens.
I just don't feel of much use to anyone so I'm pretty miserable to be around.
The other night I was on my way home from work and couldn't make it home.
I got disoriented and had to call my husband to come rescue me.
I hate to be dependent on people.
And knowing that dependency looms large in my future is depressing.

I have been pretty unproductive the last week.
I seem to be really tired and just not in the mood to do much.
That comes and goes but I hate it when I just can't pull myself up to do much.
I find it hard to contribute anything to cnversations and I just really need some quiet time.
It is hard to get thoughts to pop in my head actually.
That sounds weird I'm sure but there just isn't anything there much of the time!
That makes it pretty diffiicult to work.
I have been playing with my son's game boy for several years.
I have myself believing that it helps "keep my mind active".
However, last night I forgot how to play the game.

<doc date=Sunday, January 25, 2004>
It's hard to know what to post here sometimes.
It seems like everything I write is somewhat depressing.....but my life isn't that depressing.
I'm still amazed by the things that I can do and sometimes only mildly annoyed at what I can't do.
Friday was a bad day at work so having Saturday off was so nice.
I have to go to work today but I don't have to think much so that is good.
My brain needs more rest now than it used to.

Last night on PBS, there was a special called "The Forgetting" about Alzheimer's Disease.
It was a wonderful show.
I thought I would have a hard time watching it but I didn't.
I hope a lot of people saw it -- it was very informative and was discussed in laymen's terms.
I admire all the families on the show that shared their story with us.
One of the families, the Noonan's, have a history with AD.
One of the family members, Julie Noonan Lawson has been communicating with me on and off for the past year or so via email.
It was nice to put a face to her email address.
How brave her family is and how I admire her.
Since the program was taped Julie has lost her sister Fran (who has highlighted in the show) to AD and another brother has been diagnosed.
There are 10 children in her family and Fran was the 4th member of her family to die of Alzheimer's.
I cannot imagine what her family has and is going through.
I know how tough it is on my family with just me to worry about.
They are my heroes in coming forward with their story and sharing their lives with the nation on this show.
I could certainly relate to a lot in the show and I hope that my family will watch it.
Although my husband did not watch it with me, I hope he and my son will both watch the tape of it.
It's more for them than for me.
I hate what this disease does to families -- it's much harder on them than the patients.
I only wish they didn't have to go through it.

Last night on television there was a story about face transplants.
They talked to doctors that feel this is possible for people who have been severely burned or with birth malformities.
I told my husband it would be nice if they could transplant a new brain in me.
I feel like the scarecrow in the Wizard of Oz that needs a brain.

I had to work this morning.
We had an event in the building and my job was to take tickets for the event.
There were only 300 or so people for the event so that was no problem.
Except that some people tried to give me money for tickets, while I was taking up tickets.
Then people wanted to carry on a conversation with me while I was taking tickets.
I was doing well to say Good morning to people as I was tearing their tickets.
I didn't figure on the fact that people would want to do anything else other than give me their ticket.
That really confused me.
Then, I had to pull box office reports and figure out the client's bill.
I hadn't intended on doing that either.
So it was a tough day.
I can't do math in my head any longer and I can't do three things at once any longer.
So I was doomed from the beginning of the morning.
I had to have people go back over what I was doing and I don't like to do that.
It shows my vulnerability I guess.
And, I feel stupid.
I went to a conference where others with Alzheimer's were speaking and that is one of the things one of them said is "How it makes you feel stupid".
It's hard to get past that thought when you know you can do something or you used to be able to do something and now you can't.
That's pretty frustrating.
The good side of today was that I got to see my son.
He's the best thing that ever happened to me.
And, although he's all grown up (you are at 20 you know) he'll always be "my little boy" and yes, he hates me saying that.
We went to Atlanta to see him today for lunch.
I really miss him and I worry about the day when I will no longer be able to recognize him and how that will make him feel.
Although it was raining outside today, the sun always shines in my heart when I see him.

I'm still trying to get back into the groove of work after my trip.
Regrouping is something I don't do well anymore.
The mounds of paper are still stacked on my desk.
It may take a third person to go through and sort things for me, but I'm going to give it a try today and see what happens.
I've always prided myself on being organized -- it's much harder to do now.
It's very confusing.
On a good day, I can do it.
Perhaps I'll have a good day today.
My life is now described as "good days" and "bad days".
I sometimes call my "bad days", "bad brain days" -- which is more accurate.
I have more good days than bad days but this week a string of bad days made for a bad week.
Hopefully, with some rest this weekend, I'll do better next week.

<doc date=Wednesday, January 14, 2004>
Yes, I'm back and the trip was much harder than I had anticipated.
But, for all the wrong things I was worried about!
The level of concentration I had to keep for such a long time was probably the hardest and most wearing on me.
You don't realize how hard it is to think!
I guess that is one of those things we take for granted until it becomes a hardship......like a right handed person breaking their right hand and all of a sudden realizing how difficult life can be!
I know the city pretty well, so I wasn't worried about getting around.
I prefer to walk in New York instead of taking cabs.
I was very frustrated when I found that even though the streets are numbered I had a hard time getting around.
One day I had four appointments.
I was staying at 6th and 53rd.
My first meeting of the morning was at 6th and 45th Street.
My second appointment of the day was 7th and 46th Street.
Pretty easy to get from one place to the next, right?
Well, not for me.
I was totally confused and found myself having to walk back to the hotel at 6th and 53rd and starting all over to get to 7th and 46th.
That was pretty frustrating.
I felt really stupid.....I knew what I had to do to get there but I couldn't do it -- so I started all over!
I did the same thing for the next two appointments of the day -- went back to the hotel in between each one because I couldn't get from point A to point B.
But, I got around to where I needed to go and on time......so I shouldn't be complaining.
I figured out how to do it.......eventually.
Dealing with Alzheimer's is just dealing with your life a different way.
When you can't do something you figure out how to do it differently.
That's hard to do and I don't know how long I'll be able to do that -- think of the alternative way to do things-- but hopefully it will be awhile before that happens.
The noise was pretty overwhelming in New York, but I knew that was going to be a problem.
Everything is noisy in New York.........cabs honking, sirens wailing, people talking loud.
I was prepared for that though.
I just wasn't prepared for some of the other things that happened and, I'm too tired to go into those things!
I'm exhausted from the trip.
It took a lot more out of me than it should have.
I've been back for two days and I'm still exhausted.
Tackling emails, mail, meetings and phone calls when I got back was awful.
It is hard for me to compartmentalize things so when I got back to work and saw the mass of paper that had accumulated on my desk while I was gone I was overwhelmed.
I still haven't been able to put it into piles of what to do or what to throw away.
It's too much.
I haven't figured out an alternative way to do that yet.......but I'm trying.

I'm going to New York City today.
I think I have mentioned this before -- I'm not anxious about the trip to New York City.
What I'm anxious about is all the "noise" in New York City.
I'm going there on business and I have been going for many years.
I know the city quite well and feel comfortable in getting around the city.
But the noise confuses me.
Being in crowded restaurants, city noises, cabs honking, sirens blaring, all can get me pretty confused.
It's strange how noise affects how I think but in talking with others with Early On Set Alzheimer's this is something we all deal with.
The only way I can describe it is that the noise turns into "white noise" in my brain and I can't filter things out.
That gets me confused.
I'll have to try to stay focused and be sure I have everything written down as to where I'm going and what I'm doing.
I'll be fine.

Driving to work today the moon was just beautiful.
It was full and bright.
No clouds in the sky.
Sometimes we don't stop long enough to enjoy the beautiful things in life.

<doc date=Sunday, January 04, 2004>
There is a saying that says "You can never be too rich or too thin" -- well I think the saying should be "You can never have too many friends" -- because I certainly have great friends and I don't know what I would do without them.
I count every one of them as a blessing -- and sometimes they get counted twice!
A friend of mine that I have known for almost thirty years sent me a necklace for Christmas.
It is simple but beautiful.
It's on a delicate chain and it says love on it on one side and a chinese symbol on the other side that I assume means love as well.
For a long time I have noticed friends wearing a special necklace that someone close to them gave them and they never take it off -- kind of like a wedding ring.
Well, since I have gotten this necklace I haven't taken it off.
I'm sure that when he sent it to me he didn't know how much it would mean to me -- but it came at a time when I needed a boost and this was it.
He's a great friend as are all of my friends.

<doc date=Friday, January 02, 2004>
It's been a long time for me to be off work -- almost 10 days.
I don't usually do that but what a difference it has made for me.
I didn't realize what so much concentrating to get through a day of work was "costing" me.
I haven't had to really think and stay focused for long periods of time during my time off and it has been like a burden off my shoulders.
I did work some from home and during that brief time period during the day I would be o.k., but I do realize what a heavy weight it is on me.
I went to lunch with my family and some friends today and the noise in the restaurant was quite a bit for me to handle.
One of my biggest challenges is sorting the noise in my brain.
It is extremely hard for me to concentrate and carry on a conversation with lots going on around me.
Thankfully, my friends and family know this -- and bless their hearts they still want to be with me!
Gone are the days when Kris' monopolizes the conversation (that's probably a good thing for them).
Having my son home from college while I have been home has been great.
I really appreciate the times we have together.
Although it takes some getting used to having him being back at home.
It is harder for me when he is home because of all the extra noise that is generated.
I have a difficult time while watching television or listening to the radio when people are talking.
I tend to leave the room and find some some quieter place.
I forget when he is not here that my husband knows that we can't converse while doing something else -- so we don't.
Or we turn the "noise" off.
Simple things like this are easy to forget -- but it's just an obstacle we deal with.
It's not life threatening and knowing what you need to do when it gets a little distracting helps.
My family doesn't take offense to it -- they have learned to live it.
I love them for that.
Alan returns to school tomorrow -- that makes me sad.
By the way -- don't ever give anyone you love with Alzheimer's a jigsaw puzzle for Christmas.

Well this seems to be my first initial post.
I have thought long and hard about what to put here and I keep changing my mind or I forget what I was going to post.
Nevertheless, it is what it is.
Christmas has come and gone and today is New Year's Day.
I've always been a little down over the holidays but as the years past I seem to get more down.
I realize that next year at this time I might not be able to remember what Christmas is about or to enjoy time with my family.
I've been off this week from work and I didn't realize how tired I was.
You don't realize the toll something takes on you until you take a break.
I worked a lot over the course of December and with my new medication I think I can be the same old person that I was.
I realize how silly that is........but one can always dream.
I count my blessings every day and my family and friends are at the top of my list.
Happy New Year everyone.

My son has set up this blog for me.
I'm hoping to use it as a journal of sorts to not only help me but my friends keep up with me.
I have many many wonderful friends and family that keep up with me.
I know it is as hard for them as it is me.
They don't know how to ask how I'm doing and hopefully this will help them to understand.
I hope everyone has a great holiday season.

OK, yesterday, I had a terrible day!
I admit that I did not handle it well at all!
Today has been much better.
But yesterday serves as an example of how difficult this Corvid-19 thing is on anyone, let alone people with dementia issues.
I have seen some very POSITIVE stories on the Internet.
For instance, on BREITBART.COM there is a long interview with the Head of the FDA.
He was a research physician, working on Cancer cures before taking over FDA and he is VERY equipped to do what is needed right now.
That article is well worth your viewing.
Then, I received an email from the Florida Department of Elder Affairs.
They are partnering with the Alzheimer's Association to provide IPads to Nursing homes to facilitate Skype and Face Time calls for the residents!!
Great out reach at the perfect time!!
There is much evidence out there that the Malaria drug is helping people and the article I read said there were many other, already proven drugs, that are being investigated for Corvid-19 treatment, including a medicine used to kill parasites in horses and cattle!
Sounds strange, but if it works, it works!!
Our Country MUST pull together to beat and irradiate Corvid-19!
And after reading that Breitbart article, I know we are!
So, I will try to be honest, as I alway am, but also more upbeat!

Because of the issues with the questionnaire from Federal Long Term Care and what I believe is terrible care from the staff here, Linda and I had a difficult, day today.
We were at odds on the telephone and it showed.
These issues make what we are going through even more difficult and emotionally draining.
Not to mention it impacts my health and more important tom, Her Health!
I pray this will not last much longer.

<doc date=Monday, April 6, 2020>
I need a damn haircut!!
I am beginning to look like "Hal Sleet, the Hippy Dippy Weatherman"!
Honestly, as I tell my wife on Skype and Face Time, "this shit sucks!"
I am tired of being isolated from wife!
I am going batty from no personal contact!
Yes, the staff here is ver accommodating and meet every need I have, except personal contact.
Nor do I want them to or should they!!!
Honest, these are random thoughts.
Putting anything together coherent, is impossible at this time.

<doc date=Friday, April 3, 2020>
tonight, we were informed that those of us in Assisted Living and Skilled Care can no longer leave our rooms!
In other words, no walking the halls of assisted living for exercise or even to go get our mail.
Over the past few days, we went from being able to go outside to exercise alone, to being restricted to inside our Assisted Living Community only, to restricted to our rooms.
Of course, we have not been able to have visitors of any kind for three weeks.
Additionally, the residents of Independent Living are restricted to the campus.
They can no longer leave the campus to shop or any other reason.
I realize this is necessary.
Being off the campus put us in danger of contracting Corvid 19 and bringing it back to everyone else!
Many Independent Living residents have been shopping, going out to visit friends, buy take out food, what ever, for the last three weeks while those of us in AL and Skilled Care were locked down.
I thought that was a mistake then and I am glad the Lock Down has finally become across all communities.
I hate it!
I never want to be in this situation again, and I intend to fins=d some way to ensure Linda and I are never separated like this forcibly, again.
How that works out is yet to be determined.
But, I promise her, this is the last time we will be apart.
If the entire community was Locked Down three weeks ago, maybe we could now spend some time together.
Instead, we are apart, for how log is anyone's guess.
</doc>
<doc date=Thursday, April 2, 2020>
The people in our most vulnerable population, those who reside in Skilled Care, Assisted Living, and Dementia Care Facilities, are also the people that are and will experience the most drastic effects of being locked in, denied social contact, and no exercise!
Trust me, you cannot get any cardio exercise in a 220 square foot room filled with furniture!
And yes, Skype or FaceTime are great helps, but they do not provide the close interaction face to face communications provide.
Then, there is the last of intimacy!
Yes, older people still NEED and WANT intimacy with their mates.
I personally,  am experiencing depression, and a loss of hope already.
I have difficulty seeing anything good coming from this and I can see a whole lot of very negative things happening to our freedoms and the very structure of our Nation!
I know other residents where I am confined are very depressed, and completely shut down socially.
So, if this lock down lasts for another three or four weeks as predicted, at a minimum, what will be the outcome for the group of individuals I addressed earlier?
I am really not sure!
I can tell you I presently have a very strong fight or flight reaction to this situation.
I NEVER want to be confined, apart from my wife, in a situation where I am not in some control of my life.
How that plays out after we are released, if that ever happens, remains to be seen.
I realize this is something we have not experienced as a Nation since 1918!
And there are few people alive today that remember that time.
So, we will see, what we will see!

<doc date=Thursday, March 26, 2020>
We have been in isolation for almost two weeks.
It looks like we have a while longer, with no projected end date yet.
It is wearing on everyone but especially those with Dementia.
My question is: What will be the impact on the Dementia community when they are released into normal society again!!??
Many of the people I see have lost a good part of their ability to socialize with others already.
The have no one to talk too, and only the Television to listen to.
A frightening thought in itself!!
I have no answer.
I just know talking with people is becoming more difficult fo rme.
I have more difficulty finding and forming words.
My thoughts are jumbled.
How are we going to handle re-introducing those of us with Dementia into society again?
Or, maybe it just doesn't matter....

We have been in Hard, Complete, Lockdown for 9 days now.
Or maybe 10, I lost count.
It's interesting, when I was in the Navy I made may deployments and training cruises.
Some as little as a week and some as long as 9 months.
No telephone, little mail service, no email, no SKYPE, nothing!
No contact with my Wife or family for long periods of time.
But, I had my "Shipmates" too joke with, work with ,talk to, share dreams with.
We worked long periods of time maintaining our equipment and at least 8 hours a day on watch, besides working!
We kept busy!!
But now, I am alone.
No personal contact with anyone but the staff that brings my meals and checks my Vitals every night.
Yes, I SKYPE with my Wife every day.
And that is a blessing.
But I long to hold her in my arms, feel her breath on my neck, tell her I love her, in person and hear her tell me she loves me.
If I was in Independent Living, at least I would be with her.
I realize I am where I need to be, but, it still is having a very negative effect on me mentally and cognitively.
Am I depressed?
I'm not sure.
I am certainly unhappy with the state of affairs as they exist right now.
Can I change them,  NO, and that is the most frustrating, aggravating, past of this entire, painful, state of affairs.
I am sure or Leadership, from the President to the Director of Azalea Trace is doing their deal level best to keep us safe, in some unprecedented circumstances.
But, that does not seem to soothe my loneliness.
Only being with Linda will do that.
Life has become too short, to be apart anymore.

<doc date=Saturday, March 21, 2020>
Those of you who know me, know I normally do not blindly support the "Party Line".
I like facts and figures.
Now, I am locked up in what amounts to high security prison.
Not "Solitary Confinement" but close.
They do not slide my meals under the door!
So, I went looking for answers.
You may remember the H1N1 Flu in 2008-09.
In the United States we has something like 300,000 people infected and 12,000 + deaths!
During that time we were told to wash out hands, no crowds, social distancing, no hand shakes, etc.
But the Nation did not shut down.
So, what is the difference now?
Well, there is that little word I hear used all the time to describe this disease, but no one had truly told me what it meant.
The word is "Novel".
They call this the Covid 19 Novel Virus.
So, I go online]ne and found an explanation from Dr. Mark Seigal.
"Novel" is used to describe a virus that has never been seen before and has no know antibodies.
Now, I know why I am locked up!
The H1N1 Flu had people with antibodies protection out in the public.
So, the virus could not kill everyone.
The article I read from Dr. Seigal also stetted that, if a person infected with Covid-19 walked around the city, that person could infect 4100+ people in 30 days, considering each person he contacted caught the virus and each person they contacted caught the virus!
Pretty frightening!!
And that is why all of these precautions are necessary!!
Now, the question is; do people that have recovered from the Covid-19 virus have antibodies against this "Novel" virus?
That remains to be seen.
But until then, lockdown and shelter in place will be the new normal!
I recommend everyone arm themselves with truth about this pandemic.
It makes the things we have to do for self protection easier to endure.

I had the pleasure and honor of doing an event for the Navy with the great NFL Quarterback, Kenney Stabler.
He was a gentleman and certainly not full of himself in anyway.
He was humble, and personable.
I actually got to hold his Super Bowl ring!
It was HUGE!!!
Some years later,  I ran into him at the Mobile, Alabama Airport and I walked over to where he was seated and introduced myself again, and recalled for him the time we were together at that event.
He said her remembered that time and we talked for a moment.
Then I left him alone and went my way, not wanting to impose on his privacy.
But, before I departed, we shook hands and he said:"Thanks for remembering me."
That struck me.
Why wouldn't any football fan remember Kenney Stabler!?
But, now a long time from my Navy days, it always warms my heart the someone remembers me from my past.
Two times in the last day or so, I have had that honor.
Yesterday, a gentleman and consummate Navy Professional that I was stationed with at BUPERS called me from Montana!
Dave Armstrong!
I immediately recognized his voice without his even saying his name!!
We talked Navy for an hour!!
It was great therapy for me and I hope for him.
We are both older now and dealing with our own health issues.
But, for that hour, we were 30 years old, and still making a difference in the Navy we lived!!
Then today, I received an email that had a photo of a card, signed by many of the folks I worked with at MARMAC/NAVSEACENLANT.
It brought me great joy.
I posted a reply to them and later asked my Wife on the phone if she had seen the card?
She said, yes, it came in the mail today and she posted photos of it so I could see it!!
Yes, I emailed the Gang and told them of my confusion.
But, the love expressed in the card again, made me feel young, vibrant, and able to contribute once again.
All of the issues of the day passed away and I felt great!!
To the wonderful people that worked with me in my second Navy career, thanks for what you did then and what you do for me now.
You are all very dedicated, selfless, individuals that put the Navy and the team first, at any cost!!
To Dave, you helped me the we were together at BUPERS and you helped me over a rough spot yesterday!
Your a great friend!!
Thanks.
This Covid 19 thing has its challenges.
If we all pull together, we can beat this and come out much stronger than when we started!!
Be safe my friends.
Stay healthy!
And NEVER GIVE UP!

We have been in a "Lock Down" for about 7 days.
In the beginning, some family members were permitted to visit their husbands or wives in Skilled Care and Assisted Living if they were residents of Independent Living and passed the health screening.
A few days ago, the "Lock Down" became total and no one can visit anyone.
It makes sense.
Someone from outside the community could very easily bring the Covid-19 into Independent Living and then into the entire Skilled or Assisted community!
And just now, we were notified that the entire community is locked down, including Independent Living!
Now, on to the unexpected or unintentional impact of this Pandemic.
There are spouses sitting in chairs, on the out doors,for hours, looking into their spouses room, to see them as they talk on the phone or just smile at each other!
Love does find a way!!
This display of enduring love has touched me deeply.
Yesterday, my Wife came to my window, with Zeus the Wonder dog, to see me and tell me she loved me.
It wasn't touching, but is was the most intimate expression of love I could ever ask for.
Nothing can separate those who truly love each other.
I have seen it here before as a spouse was too ill to even know their wife or husband were by their side, but they were there, until the end, even if that was months long!
How ever this virus came to be, man made or natural, it will not defeat us and it will only strengthen the Love we have for our spouses, children, and Country.
GOD will provide a way!
Trust Him!!
Pray!!

It has been 5 days since we were effectively locked down in response to the very real, Corovirus 19 issues.
I must say the response at Azalea Trace is great.
I do not believe they ever had a practice run at locking down Assisted Living and Skilled Care.
Feeding a large group of elderly people in their rooms, three meals a day, maintaining cleanliness, and controlling entrance to these susceptible communities.
Yet, without prior trial, they have executed this as flawless as anyone could ask!
That being said,  have noticed some issues with Dementia Patients in Assisted Living that I think need documenting for future actions.
For instance, keeping Dementia Patients isolated, in their rooms, wait little or no human interface, from friends or family, is causing some to become more agitated, frightened, disoriented, and confused.
One person seemed upset to tears because that individual could not go to the dinning room to eat with friends.
Others are upset because they cannot attend Church this morning.
Social contact is very necessary for those of us with any type of Dementia.
And I believe we are entering into some mental care areas that we are without experience in dealing with.
From a personal point of view, I have spent long periods of time, (months at a time) away from my Wife, Son, and Friends, on Navy Combat Ships, without telephone, email, or mail service.
No contact with them at all.
Yet, I was surrounded by Shipmates that I had relationships with and so there was social interaction.
Meals together, card games, conversations.
This is much different.
Yes, I can call my wife and do.
But, I have no personal interaction with her or anyone else.
So, this is new territory for me also and I can testify it is difficult.
I am more disoriented.
I am noticing more small hallucinations.
Little rodents, or things running across the room.
Noises I cannot identify.
These things upset me, but I can identify them as hallucinations after a short time.
But the emptiness of being away from the one person I love with all my heart for now 5 days, is difficult.
Yes, it is necessary, I agree.
But it is an issue that needs to be addressed for future issues like this.
And yes, I believer there will be other issues like this in the future.
I will continue to write on this topic as this "Lock Down" period progresses.
I hope it will help make things better in the future.

I had an experience with a virus much like what we are facing now.
Just before I retired from Civil Service, we had a group of tech reps in the Persian Gulf for about 4 weeks, working on a number of U.S. Navy Ships.
It was at the end of Desert Storm 2.
One of the en that worked for me, came down with what her and everyone else thought was a cold, on the day before he drew back to Norfolk.
When he arrived in Norfolk, he was int eh Hospital in 24 hours!
The did everything they could for 2 weeks, but the virus won and we lost Kenny.
I still hurt from his untimely death.
The medical establishment was completely helpless and dumbfounded over his case.
The symptoms would improve and then get much worse.
He went through at least three of those swings and then he died.
From what I have read, and understand, from the CDC and NIH websites, this virus is much the same.
It mutates when treatment is applied, making it immune to that treatment.
I am not a doctor, but I know what happened to Kenny.
The CDC says there is no treatment for this Corovirus 19.
Probably so.
Where I live, some of the residents are being toads about the precautions Azalea Trace and ACTS Corporate are taking.
But I see their proactive approach as prudent, necessary, and medically warranted .
We are in a"Soft Lock Down" right now in Assisted and Skilled Care.
No outside visitors, Meals in our rooms, Community wide, no larger group gatherings of any kind.
I believe this will most likely progress to a "Hard Lock Down" with no movement out of Assisted Living or Skilled Care, very soon.
That is what I would do.
We need to keep those who are not effected by the virus, completely isolated from the virus.
And keep anyone who might have been exposed to the virus off of our campus until the threat is gone.
There are too many frail, elderly, people with compromised immune systems living in the entire Azalea Trace community, including Independent Living,  to do anything less.
One more thing;  I am not afraid of this virus.
Because I am not afraid fo death.
Death has no sting, because of the finish work of the Messiah, Jesus the Christ, on the Cross.
His blood was shed so that I could be free from the penalty of death that I deserve because of my sins!
I am free and looking forward to eternity in Heaven because of what Jesus did!!
Praise God!!
Nothing else maters.

As my LBD journey progresses, some things seem more difficult and more agitating.
For instance, I have great difficulty riding in a car.
The traffic around us seems much closer than my Wife says it is.
The speed of the car seems much greater than she or the speedometer says it is.
And she does not stop early enough for me, because the cars seem closer than they really are.
It is not because She is a bad driver, it is because of how my LBD has impacted how I see things.
But, my twitching, yelling "Look Out!"
and telling her to stop do not make my Wife feel very good.
For that I am sorry and I am trying to curb my comments.
Noises in general are causing me more issues.
The person what lives in the room next to me in deaf!
Deaf as a stone wall!
She often has her television on very loud at night which causes me great agitation.
Thankfully, the nursing staff here at Azalea Trace is very efficient at solving that issue.
Noise is not my friend.
Even the new music at Church causes me issues.
Most of the time, I just sit quietly and pray during the music portion of the Service.
I realize, still, that others respond well to Praise Music.
But, it is an issue for me and me alone.
So, I try to be respectful of others.
Just the same, those of you who are caregivers that read the blog need to understand how loud, unfamiliar, music can agitate an Dementia patient.
I like the solitude and stillness of being alone.
The "Cabin" provides me that comfort and I am grateful.
I often set here, playing solitaire on my iPad and reminiscing about the past.
Sometimes, I think of an old "Shipmate" and try to find Him on the Internet.
Most of them are past away though.
Azalea Trace is doing a great job trying to stay ahead of the Corovirus.
Large group events are suspended until further notice.
Those of us in Assisted Living are eating in our rooms.
Anything and everything is being done to mitigate the spread of this virus.
We are in difficult times and I appreciate and respect the efforts of the Staff here at Azalea Trace.
Composing these posts has become more difficult for me.
But I will continue to do my best to keep you updated.

I am sitting here drinking Coors Banquet Beer, reminiscing about the best part of my life, my Navy Career, and I realized I was not in the Navy but the Navy was in me!
I wore the Navy like a custom made set of Dress Blues!
You  remember, those from Anchor Naval Taylors, Liberty Cuffs, Pegged Legs, zipper in the side of the jumper, made of Sharkskin!!!
All of the ship I was on wan mine!
I knew every inch of that ship!
Not just the Gunner's Mate portion, but al of the ship.
Damage control, Engineering, the Bridge, Fire Control, all of the replenishment rigs, Sea Detail, Security Force, Master at Arms, the Mess Decks, Supply Department, EVERYTHING!!
The ship was me and I was the ship!!
If anything happened, I was there!!
And I loved it!
I miss those times, and I miss my old friend!

Who is Don Dolence?
I am the  first illegitimate son of a Cleveland bar maid who had four children out of wedlock in the 1050s..  Raised by wonderful people that we're no related to rebut loved me like   I was their own blood.
I quit school in the 12th grade and joined the Navy after breaking every rule and law that existed.
I found a home in the Navy because the rules applied to every enlisted person, equally.
I worked hard and promoted fast.
I drank too much, paid that price many times, and still succeeded in the Navy.
I made may friends and many great men mentored me, including Bill Mowery, James Smith, Harold Simpson, Sam Johnson, Dave Armstrong, Carl Morris, Red Mills, and many others.
I made Master Chief Gunner's Mate much earlier than most.
(14.5 years of service)  Retired as the Force Master Chef, Surface Forces, Atlantic Fleet.
Went to work for the Navy as a Tech Rep and spent 20 more years in Civil Service, retired as a GS 13.
More important, I accepted Jesus Christ s my personal Savior, became an Ordained Pastor in the Grace Brethren Church and had my best times working for the Lord.
I was diagnosed wit Lewy Body Dementia and had a very smooth glide slope until recently.
Now, Things are getting difficult.
But I still depend on Jesus to see me through the difficult times.
I have no anger, not grief, now frustration about my disease.
I am Still a Master Chief Gunner's Mate.
I Still like to drink beer.
I Still like good, old Country Music.
George Jones, Merle Haggard, Hank, Willie, Waylon.
Why do I write this?
Because I an fading, yet who I was is still who I am.
I miss my shipmates.
I still miss being a Tin Can Sailor.
I still miss being me...

More and more, I get instantly agitated over noise and anything that interrupts my train of thought.
It is not a slow boil, it is instant anger.
Television is the worst offender!
My wife wants the television on 24/7 and the commercials do not bother her.
She lo es to comment on whatever is on the television, and it irritates me.
Of course, I can't say much.
So, I steam even more.
Of course, that causes BP issues and some dizziness.
That is the best feature of "The Cabin".
I seldom have the TV on and no-one talks to me because the door is locked.
Works for me.
I need quiet, alone time, and control of may environment to keep an even keel.
Another issue that seems to be increasing is vision difficulties.
Things seem far away and indistinct.
I laugh everyone I shave.
When I was a littler boy, I would ask my Dad why he wore his glasses when he shaved.
Now I know!
If I did not wear my glasses, I would cut my nose off!
But even with my strong glasses, I have difficulties seeing.
Reading is also more difficult.
to because I cannot see the words, but more and more, the letters don't make words.
I have had that issue off and on for a long time, but it is really becoming an issue now.
Out Church sings "Praise" music and I don't know the songs.
Many times, I can't figure out the words in time to sing them!
Oh well, LBD progresses.
No surprise.

OK, I am very agitated, so this post may be  RAW but it will display how seemingly small things fore me up!
The community I live in, filled with liturgical libtards, loves to celebrate Mardi Gras.
They have a 20 foot long display case filled with mannequins dressed up like the tras people in New Orleans.
They have a Fat Tuesday meal, and get all giddy about this sacrilegious  celebration of debauchery and sin!!
Then, they all go to the priest on ash Wednesday and get their forgiveness and ashes on their forehead!
Celebrating Mardi Gras is against God's will, the written WORD, and all that Christ taught us and dies for.
If you don't agree, I hope you like high heat for eternity!
Today, Linda and I were headed out for our walk.
As a precursor, she had a later Jurassic movie on the TV that was agitating me.
So, I was on edge.
As we passed the Mardi Gras display case, she wanted to find the mouse!
They hide a gray mouse every week in the display case.
and it is fun to find it!
It is a good mental exercise.
But, I will not even look at the Mardi Gras or Halloween displays!
So, I went to the end and waited for her.
A couple that I am friendly with, asked me if I had found the mouse yet?
I replied no, I would not look at the Mardi Gras display because Mardi Gras is sacrilegious.
The lady asked me why, so I told her, using some rather "Blue" descriptions of Mardi Gras.
She agreed with me, and then I sat down in a chair.
When Linda came to get me and continue our walk, I told her I though I should not walk anymore but go back to the cabin.
And here I am, pissed off, blood pressure raging, and ready to explode.
I wish everyone would realize what agitates me and keep those things away from me when I am with them.
Shoot-em up bang bang movies have been off my viewing list for at least three years!!
And I am on record for hating anything the liturgical church does.
On the good side, the Neudexta does work.
I did not totally blow up and there are no injuries.
So, I guess it was a good day.

Tomorrow is the Memorial Service for a friend of mine, who died from the complications of Lewy Body Dementia.
She was a strong, relentless, Lewy Body Warrior.
And trust me, she had all of the worst issues of Lewy Body Dementia.
In the end, her autonomic functions stopped and she could not even swallow.
She lost her ability to speak about two years ago, yet, she still let everyone know how she was doing.
Always had a smile, always liked to meet new people and make new friends.
Her husband was her caregiver and he should be awarded caregiver of the Decade!
He even learned to do her hair and her make-up!
Peggy passed away Christmas Morning.
Her strong, life long faith in the Finished Work of Christ on the Cross gives her family and everyone who knew her, the reassurance that we will see Peggy again, in Heaven.
Her family has asked that in lieu of flowers, a donation to the Lewy Body Dementia Association (LBDA.ORG) be given.
I encourage everyone who reads my blog to do just that, in the Memory of Peggy Gideons.
Linda and I are going to donate, and I pray you will also.
Peggy will be missed, but she will never be forgotten.

It has been a long time since I posted anything.
Not that  have not wanted too, but I just cannot organize my thoughts to write them.
The Christmas holidays are always a very down time for me, even before LBD.
Not that the fact the Jesus Christ stepped into the stream of Humanity, solely to pay the price for our sins, should not be a great celebration.
But the commercialization and my childhood experiences have caused me to run from the Christmas season.
Also, I have been having far more difficulty expressing myself in any manner.
I am trying to control my agitation and be more calm around Linda and others.
No one should have to deal with my outbursts.
However, some family issues arose during the Holidays that threw a hand grenade into any enjoyment that might have been there.
How am I doing.
Worse, more reclusive, the hallucinations are back and more active, I have difficulty speaking, expressing myself, dealing with groups of people, and watching anything but home improvement shows on TV.
I even turned off football games that had bad officiating because I got so agitated by the direction of the games.
And please tell everyone that knows me not to mention college sports of any kind.
I hate the mere idea of college sports.
You go to college for knowledge, not sports.
And please explain to me how the NCAA can make $55 Billion a year on Football alone and be tax exempt!!
Some people try to engage me on college football and they get FLAME SPRAYED!!
I am just not the social person I once was.
I am unhappy, mad at the world, and in general, not real good to be around.
Not that I do that on purpose.
I do nougat up every morning thinking, I am going to be a real nasty person today!!
But, sometimes, I just can't control it.
The "Cabin" continues to be my refuge.
Oh, "The Cabin".
In the midst of Christmas, the family explosion, and my LBD getting more nasty, I had to move room because of some upcoming construction.
Now the Azalea Trace Staff went to great ends to make my move as smooth and gentle as possible.
The remodeled the room I was moving into.
The flooring I bought for the original "Cabin" is no longer available.
So, I mad a selection that is good, but not near as good as what I had.
And even though they did everything very well, I still had moments of agitation and anger.
It took me three days to get settled in my "New Cabin".
But, I am now settled, secure, and comfortable.
But it did add to the issues.
The Memory Support Group we started continues to be a comfort to me and those who attend.
We are up to 23 members!
And I must say, they are all great, brave, supportive folks.
We are all blessed!
So, I will make every effort mental possible to post more.
I truly do apologize for my absence, but I believe I have explained why I was UA!
Happy New Years!
2020!
How the Hell did we get here?

Well, that was quick!
We received an email from our Neurologist Friday night telling us her results were totally normal!
No sign of plaques or tangles.
No brain degradation.
No Alzheimer's!
Outstanding.
So, now;  what is her problem.
I went to the Internet and looked up the side effects of some of the drugs she takes.
BOOM!!!!
There it was.
Zoloft, is not supposed to be prescribed for people over 65!!
It causes dementia like issues including memory issues, sight issues, and instability walking.
The warning says when people over 65 take Zoloft, they are at aa higher risk of falling and breaking a hip, leg, or arm!
She has stopped taking Zoloft and we were supposed to see our GP tomorrow for a scheduled appointment.
Today, they called us and said she had an unplanned issue and they canceled our appointment.
Since the GP prescribed Zoloft, we were anxious to see her.
But, she is not the most informed, up to date, well researched, doctor I have ever seen, so who cares,  My Wife is off Zoloft.
And we will see if her dementia like issues go away.
Of course, the neurologist we see knew she was on Zoloft too!
You would think she might have tried getting her off that med before we had the PET scan that we may have to pay for out of pocket.
I have said this before;  Medical care in Pensacola is poor at best!
Do not move to the Panhandle of Florida if you want to see a doctor that cares about you or knows anything discovered past 1920!!
Maybe it is time to move.

Yesterday, we went to get Linda's PET scan for Alzheimer's and PCA, Posterior Cortical Atrophy.
The Hospital we went to was exceptionally modern and very professional.
The entire experience was bathed in caring concern and professionalism.
We were impressed!
This test is designed to find the plaques and tangles that are the markers and cause of Alzheimer's and related diseases.
Since she has all the symptoms of PCA, that would also be identified by this test.
It is a simple test and not invasive.
She had to fast the night before  and then she had an IV of the things the PET Scan looks for.
The testing took 90 minutes start to finnish!
Now, we wait for the results.
Why get this test?
Well, for one thing, a new drug that stops Alzheimer's in os's tracks is in Level 3 testing with great results.
Its is presently called BAN 2401.
You can look up these tests on the Centers for Disease Control WEBSITE.
And since the PET scan can find Alzheimer's 20 years before the first symptom appears, it may be the end of Alzheimer's when coupled with the BAN 2401 drug.
Some insurances will not pay for the PET scan and we do not know if our insurances will pay or not.
If not, we will have to pay about $4000 for the test.
Expensive, yes.
But the benefits may be really BIG!
I have spent much more on worse things than this!
Again, we will see.

Everything seems to be more than I can handle.
I am overwhelmed by the simplest things.
Riding in the car is an overwhelming sensory experience!
Everything seems ready to crash into us.
The cars are so close.
A scheduled event is a monumental thing.
I only seem somewhat comfortable in the "Cabin" with complete silence and all the lights on.
If the computer needs an update or has issues loading, I simply turn it off.
I stopped playing "Freecell" because of the constant attack of ads!
I deleted the app!!
My head feels like it is empty, literally!
It feels numb and empty.
My vision is distant and fuzzy.
These are issues that have been getting worse recently and now seem to be a really big issue for me.
I am even more anti-social!
I do not want to be around people.
Quiet, calm, well lighted surrounding are what I need.
I will give credit to Neudexta.
It keeps my anger outbursts at bay, for the most part.
If I do get angry, it seems to be short lived.
That is a blessing.
I am truly glad I do not drive, even though, I ask my Wife, everyday of I can get my Driver's License back!
She grins and says no.
However, I still have to drive the car in to the car wash track!!
This is a further deepening of my LBD journey.
Not unexpected, but frustrating just the same.

As you all know, my Wife and Started a Memory Support Group here at Azalea Trace over three years ago.
We started with three brave souls and now have attendance in the upper teens, every Wednesday!
We have had numerous guest speakers, like today when we had a speaker from the Therapy Department come poll us on things they could do better for Dementia patients!
In the capacity of Facilitator of the group, I have tried to help people deal with the effects of Dementia, for the patient and the caregiver.
I research new information like the great news about the Ban 2401 drug trials, or information on how to deal with different Dementia issues.
We have discussed every fact of Dementia, even the need to prevent your Dementia patient from getting septic because they do not have bowel movements!
Yes, that is a BIG ISSUE for Dementia patients!
It can and will kill you!
But, recently, my efforts to help a couple has caused me serious problems because I got in over my head.
I often tell folks; "I am not a doctor, and I do not play one on Television!"
In this case, I tried to help with issues I clearly should have stayed away from.
In the end, I did get the folks connected to competent medical care,  But, I am now very agitated, and the sanctity of "The Cabin" has been breached.
The wonderful Nurse Team and the Director of Assisted Living noticed my issues and interceded in a very efficient, caring, gentle manner.
They are professionals in the first degree.
And I am starting to hang up my spurs as the Facilitator of the Memory Support Group also.
My ability to lead this group is diminishing fast and my Wife has asked a group member to take over.
I agree!
I never realized I was where I was until this week.
It is time I be a full time Dementia patient and enjoy the wonderful care this facility offers.
I am worn out and at my wits end.

Recently, I have had a strong desire to move to a remote, defendable, location in a fortified home and live an isolated, quiet, life.
Recently, one evening when I was alone at "The Cabin", I had a lengthy, verbal, argument with my wife about this topic.
Every thing I said about the need for me, and us to move to a remote, quiet location was expertly countered by her.
After a lengthy discussion, I agreed that she was right.
The problem is, I was alone in "The Cabin"!
I was talking out loud but she was not there.
She was there to me and she was discussing the idea with me.
Then I realized, I had lost the argument with my Wife and she was not even there!
Damn!!
I have had this occur in the past.
But, this is the first time I lost an argument to no one present!
This is a frustrating journey.

<doc date=Saturday, October 19, 2019>
Recently, I have had a more constant disoriented feeling.
Things look unfamiliar, distant, eve fuzzy to me.
I feel like I am in a mental fog.
Naps sometimes help me with this issue, as it did today.
But, it returns as I get more tired or if I am agitated.
I am always more comfortable in "The Cabin" but I continue to spend great times with m Wife in our apartment.
We have had some wonderful outings and meals together in recent weeks.
She is also taking a very welcomed, active, role in the memory Support Group she helped me start three years ago.
She brings a fresh view of dementia care and of my experiences to the group.
And she relieves me of the stress of facilitating the group!
She has been a tremendous addition to the group.
Writing has become more difficult also.
I post less often because of that.
My days are now shorter and I spend more time napping and alone.
It takes a lot out of me to constantly control the agitation that groups of people cause me.
"Show Time" is loosing it's positive effect.
I guess that is to be expected.
Recently Linda has been tested for cognitive functions.
That test showed she was doing "Normal".
But, her issues with math, vision, thinking that everything is her fault, and sequencing actions, told us something was wrong!
She met with our Neurologist and told her of her deep frustration and fear of her issues.
Tests were ordered.
But, I got online and did some research.
I found a little diagnosed condition, directly related to Alzheimer's and Lewy Body Dementia, called Posterior Cortical Atrophy.
It is a dementia that effects the portion of the brain the controls vision!
The symptoms of PCA fit her demonstrated issues to a "TEE"!
We took a copy of the Mayo Clinic and Cleveland Clinic research to our Neurologist and they are now moving in that direction.
My question, is why do I have to do the research?!
Yes, I know doctors are overworked today.
And we are lucky I am so tenacious.
But still, shouldn't the doctor's office have someone employed to do research?!
That is Linda's idea, not mine.
That's all for now.

<doc date=Saturday, October 5, 2019>
We recently went through a tough spell caused by a change in my routine.
I must remind everyone that all of us are learning how to deal with Lewy Body Dementia, every minute of every day.
Linda and I were reminded of that fact, abruptly, about 10 days ago.
She brought an orphan, feral, kitten into our home, ostensibly to foster.
Our dog, Zeus, wanted to play with the kitten since he likes all animals.
The kitten was not so sure of that fact.
We purchased all the necessary kitten supplies and some things not necessary.
The kitten was living the "GOOD LIFE"!
Zeus became jealous on the second day and I was becoming very agitated because my routine had been altered.
Zeus decided to show his jealousy by urinating on his newer, luxurious, dog bed!
I exploded!
Yelling, cussing, I threw the dog bed in the dumpster and said I never wanted the cat and wanted it gone, now!
Or words to that effect.
Luckily, a CNA in Assisted Living where I live, was looking for a kitten to adopt.
We took the kitten to her and she agreed.
The kitten went to his luxurious new home that afternoon.
But that is only the beginning of the story.
I became very closed off from Linda and everyone else.
For three or four days, I did not shower, brush my teeth, or shave.
I missed meals, and did not talk with Linda except for mandatory issues.
She, kept trying to get me to talk, but I refused.
I was in a very DARK PLACE!
She finally got me to discuss my issues and she in turn brought up some issues that were bothering her.
It was a frank, pointed, tense, discussion.
It was not an argument.
We were both open to the other's opinions and issues.
At no time did either of us discount what the other one said.
And, the exchange helped me settle down.
But, as Linda knows, I am still not completely over this.
My short term memory has suffered, I am more easily agitated and have blown up since then,  I am more closed up and reclusive, and I run from anything that makes me agitated.
For instance, I love Barrett Jackson Car auctions on the Motor Trend Network.
There is one in Scottsdale Arizona that I watch faithfully, start to finish which is 7 days long!!
The Las Vegas event was this weekend and I was anxiously waiting for a much advertised collection to come up for auctions.
What did the morons at the Motor Trend Network do?
Put commercials on for half of the collection being auctioned off!
I shut the show off and WILL not watch it again.
The pissed me off!
The point of all this is, the recent happenings have impacted me in a very negative way.
Introducing that kitten into our life was a mistake.
I know Linda wanted to make sure that under nourished, black kitten lived a good life and I agree.
But, it caused both of us issues that will impact me for ever.
Changing my routine is not a good idea.
But she did not fully understand that she she started.
How could she?!
It is not her fault!!
There is no manual on how to be a LBD care giver, written by a successful LBD caregiver.
Why, because there has never been a fully successful LBD caregiver!!
So, LBD caregivers, take note!
Everything is an experiment.
Some work, some don't!
Learn from your mistakes!

<doc date=Thursday, September 26, 2019>
I recently viewed on Youtube, a video from Dr. Teepa Snow on our problems with doing things and depression.
She presented a fact that our brains are impacted by the dementia and we cannot do the things we once liked to do.
It is not hat we do not want to, we CAN'T!!
She further stated that anti-depressants will NOT help this issue!
I have taken anti-depressants for a long time with no positive effect.
Now I KNOW WHY!!
MOST DOCTORS AND SPECIALISTS ARE NOT INFORMED ON THESE ISSUES!!
Today, we went to se my neurologist and she had no idea about BAN 2401!
She told us she did not do research because her life was too busy..
I can understand that, but where does that leave us, the patients?
So, I encourage each of you to be more informed through the use of the internet.
Yes, there is junk on the internet.
But there is a wealth of information out there also.
Go find it!
Check reputable sources, like the National Institutes for Health or Mayo or ALZ.Org.
to LBD.Org, or other known entities.
To be fore warned is to be FORE ARMED!

I just have not felt like writing.
My world, my life is closing in on me.
I am very content in my Cabin in Assisted Living.
I have little desire to be with people, although I try very hard to be pleasant when I encounter folks.
I still enjoy being with my Wife and Zeus, the Wonder Dog.
But I am most comfortable alone in the Cabin, in the quiet, alone with my thoughts and dreams.
One of my frustrations and angers is the reoccurring thought that those things I wanted to accomplish will never BE accomplished.
Linda and I discussed that tonight.
I think she understands.
Much of what I liked to do I am isolated from here in East Lower Alabama.
My friends, My hobbies, My interests are not here.
I am a prisoner of this condition.
It is no-one's fault.
It is just what it is!
Linda and I discuss me getting my driver's license back at least once a week.
She patiently tells me why I can't.
I get frustrated, but I know she is right.
More shackles on my prison chain.
(Ha ha!)
Today, talking to Jerry, we reminisced about the Gun Shows in Virginia we often enjoyed.
After the call, I looked up the Big Show in Richmond.
I long to go to that show again.
To experience the freedom, see old friends, and be me.
But, it is not to be.
Tomorrow is Memory Group.
Always a good time but a very demanding and tiring time for me.
Thursday, we finally go to see the Neurologist about Linda's testing.
Medical care her in East Lower Alabama is rudimentary at best!
I believe a Witch Doctor would be better.
See why I have not posted!
LBD is winning and I am running out of fight.

I was down for about two weeks with Bronchitis.
I knew it was coming, I got a cold, went to our GP, and told her it was going t turn into Bronchitis, as it has for years.
And when it does, because of the orthostatic hypotension, I cough until I pass out.
Bur, she said, no, it is just a cold.
The next night I was in the emergency room for 5 hours!
Then over 5 days, in my room in Assisted Living, coughing up stuff that looks ugly, and discovering two new hernias!
No issue, I can still manage them.
I am on the mend now, getting out, even back to walking every evening.
But, my chest is still tight and  still cough.
And, I am still using my albuterol inhaler a couple of times a day.
Normally, bronchitis takes 6 weeks to completely clear up if I don't get another bout of it!
Again, I hate passing out when I cough!!
Linda and I have noticed this bout has impacted me in a number of ways.
But, that is normal.
I never regain those losses in cognition or stamina.
It just IS the new normal.
I am napping more, sleeping in later, and more agitated.
I can't even have the sound on when I watch Football because it agitates me terribly!
During my bronchitis issues, my GP prescribed Advair.
I tried it for two days.
My heart kept trying to either stop or jump out of my chest, in alternating patterns!
I read the pamphlet that came with the drug, and after that, decided the cure was worse than the disease!
Can Cause THRUSH!!
The heck with that!
I can see downward progression of my LBD journey.
Both physically and mentally.
Linda sees it also.
We try to manage these issues with exercise, diet, rest, and understanding.
She has really become completely intone with me and my mental and physical abilities.
If we go out to shop or do errands, she is constantly monitoring my mental state.
She knows when to take me home, just before I am completely worn out.
I really appreciate her help and care.
Being in groups of people for anything but a very short period of time is overwhelming and always leads to me getting agitated and angry.
But, she watches that too.
Sleep comes more difficult lately.
I go to bed tired, but my mind gets overwhelmed with negative thoughts and scenarios.
It takes me a long time to sort them out and finally get to sleep.
Sometimes, I get up, play more computer games until I can't keep my eyes open.
Well, that is my update for now.
Time for quiet, Freecell, and sleep.

I would like to thank ACTS Corporate and the Regional Vice President for openly discussing the issues of the replacement of our Executive Director.
The VP openly discussed the issues in a Town Hall Meeting and answered wide ranging questions about the future growth of our community.
He met with numerous residents, one on one, to answer their questions.
To say he was brave, especially in the Town Hall meeting would be fair!
People can be direct, self-centered, and self-serving in these circumstances.
He did a very good job keeping the questions and topics on track.
Not an easy job!
I know from personal experience.
I am even willing to state, for the record, that my previous post WAS  way too direct, disrespectful, and out of line.
Certainly I knew ACTS and the Regional VP were going to come address these issues.
I was wrong to use this forum in the manner that I did and I ask your forgiveness.
Sometimes, I bark when I should sit sown and shut up.
This was clearly one of those times.
I was clearly one of those self-serving, self-centered people.
Please forgive me.
I honesty, truly, love living at Azalea Trace.
I like the people here and I love the caring staff.
I am very defensive of the staff, because they treat my wife and I so well.
The past Executive Director was one of those people.
And, while I admit I do not, nor do I ever want to know what happens behind the scenes in the management offices.
her demeanor and caring attitude made me feel safe, loved, and welcomed.
But, that is how Azalea Trace, and ACTS in general makes me feel.
And I still feel that way.
I just need to realize I am not in charge of anything, anymore.
There are wonderful professionals taking care of me and making sure I am happy, safe, and comfortable.
We could ask for nothing else.
Thanks ACTS and Azalea Trace!

<doc date=Sunday, August 25, 2019>
If you are from my generation, you heard that many times on the Rock and Roll radio station in your hometown.
Back to back hits from your favorite groups!
Commercial Free!!
Six HITS in a row!
Remember?!
Well as we age, those hits are not fun anymore.
I am just now getting better from my most recent bout with bronchitis.
Most of that misery was caused by poor, inattentive, assembly line medicine practiced by uncaring, undereducated, overworked, medical semi-professionals.
I got much better care for the Independent Duty Corpsman on a Destroyer, without a Medical Officer, than I have received in the almost 8 years I have lived in Pensacola.
However, the staff here at the Assisted Living side of Azalea Trace did a great job watching over me.
I could not have been cared for any better and I thank them for their caring, professional, attention.
During my recovery, on the first day I stuck my head out of my room, (I stayed in my room for 5 1/2 days, without leaving!)
I saw a memo stating that our Executive Director had been relived of her duties!
That was one of those HITS I did not see coming.
I liked her.
She helped me when I sincerely needed help.
She cared about the community and all of us here, employees and residents.
She inherited a mess and yes it got worse, but she was turning things around.
It takes a while to turn a big organization around.
There is resistance from all sides to change!
Her departure comes on the heels of the departure, without notice, of two Nurse Practitioners, and various other staff members.
At least one who should have left in handcuffs!!
All of this change, turmoil, angst, has me questioning whether I want to or need to stay at Azalea Trace any longer.
Remember, I moved to Assisted Living to get away from these sort of issues.
In my past life, I wanted and needed to know what was going on behind the curtains.
But now, I only want to see a smooth, well run facade from my side.
The inner workings are not, nor should be, my concern.
Yet, HITS like these keep focusing me on the negatives and cause me to spend hours questioning my decision to move here.
Again, in my present state, I do not need this aggravation, angst, upheaval, and turmoil.
And I expect senior management to make sure it does not occur.
But, since we moved to Azalea Trace, almost five years ago, the management of Azalea Trace has been in constant turmoil!
And since I know ACTS management reads this blog, I won't recount the past director issues, the accounts person that had sticky fingers, three lost Nurse Practitioners, and serious maintenance issues that never seem to be addressed.
Acts is spending millions of dollars building new cottages and that's fine.
And there is the promised, but yet unseen, expansion of Assisted and Skilled Care.
The pool was completely remodeled and modernized with spectacular results.
And a Complete Sprinkler System was retrofitted into the Mid-Rise, making it even safer!!
But, daily maintenance issues seem to be overwhelming.
Hell, I had to tell the Director the drain was clogged in the portico of the mid-rise causing months of flooding in the foyer!!
Maintenance never even checked that!!
A blind man on a galloping horse should have seen that one!
You can tell I am upset, but the HITS, keep on coming!
Azalea Trace is obviously broke!
And that breakage is on the Management team, hence the departure of our Director.
And since ACTS Corporate caused that departure, I ask the question; "What are you going to do ACTS Management to make Azalea Trace whole again, quickly?
If I were in charge, I would be here explaining everything in a TOTALLY open manner.
Again, the ball in in your court!
But, the truth is  I cannot take anymore hits.
And I will bet I am not the only one frustrated with this management mess.

I have had bronchitis for 5 or 6 days.
I went to our GP last Thursday, with a bad cold and told her, as I have in the past, that it would turn into bronchitis.
She ignored me and gave me nothing of note.
The next evening I was in the Emergency Room for 5 hours and finally got some antibiotics.
The ER Doctor said I need the antibiotics to ensure it did not progress into pneumonia.
She was actually concerned about that possibility.
I did everything the ER doctor prescribed,   But, of course, it had progressed to the point that those drugs would not work.
So the Nursing Staff here at Azalea called my GP for a RX for nebulizer treatment.
My GP denied that, even though, I have had good results from nebulizer treatments in the hospital with previous Bronchial infections.
Did I mention I have not had a good nights sleep in 6 days!?
Kind of hard to sleep when you are up, coughing up brown phlegm every 15 minutes.
In any case, my GP wanted me to try....TRY  some inhaler instead.
The GP's nurse called me and explained this to me and I countered with past successes, to no avail.
It is 26 hours since that telephone call and I have not received the new, untested on me, drug yet!
I could have had three nebulizer treatments already because Azalea Trace is equipped to provide that on call.
Again, I explained that to the GP's nurse, to no avail.
Needless to say, I still feel like shit, I cannot breathe well, and I am still coughing up larger amounts of brown phlegm!
Time to find a new GP!
If I live through this one.

Standing in the doctors office , one of those paper gowns they give you, it is hard to hide anything!
And that is exactly how I am going to be in this post.
If you know me personally, what I am about to say will come as a surprise.
If you are a reader of my blog, maybe not.
In any case, here goes; I am completely unhappy in my life.
I miss the camaraderie of the Navy.
I miss the excitement of the Navy.
I miss being a Master Chief Gunner's Mate.
I miss being able to drive, go places alone, be independent, and make my own decisions.
I miss arguments with idiots that think because they have a degree in basket weaving, they know something about anything!
I miss being out in bar with my shipmates, telling Sea Stories and being MEN!
I miss being strong, invincible, tough, argumentative, always right!
I miss being me!!
I hate and I am sickened by the circumstances of my birth, my birth mother, my birth father.
They were terrible humans for bringing me into this world without caring for me.
M mother used me as a meal ticket with the Mills family.
Shame on her.
She lied to me about everything in my life!
How I came to be, the status of my birth father, the fact that she had three other children out of wedlock and never told me until I was 31 years old.
My birth father was a self-centered moron that fathered many children he did not support or live.
I know one other and she is scared for life as I am.
My journey with LBD has forced me to face my inner angers because I cannot cover the with vibrato anymore, and I hate that.
LBD has life me a weak, self hating, unhappy, wreck.
On the outside, to anyone who comes in contact with me, I am FINE!
Just ask me.
I almost always say; I am outstanding!
Nothing could be further from the truth.
I hate Florida and the morons that live here.
But truthfully, the only place I ever fit was in the Navy.
I figured that out wen I was 17, in Boot Camp, at Great Lakes!
We were all the same.
The rules applied to all of us equally.
Rich, poor, smart, dumb, White, Black, Hispanic, Native American, Oriental, Middle Eastern]n, or any mix, we were all the same.
If you worked hard, you moved up.
If you tried, you were rewarded for that effort.
Sweat, blood, sore muscles, effort, working above your mental level, all paid off.
What yo could do was worth more than what you knew, or thought you knew.
Another dig at those who think education give them worth.
I hate living with landed gentry, self-centered, nare do wells, that never DID anything.
People that look down their noses at anyone who got their hands dirty.
People that have no idea of no anything works.
I am totally, unhappy and uninterested in living in the world LBD has placed me in.
I am angry, ready to fight, and totally pissed off at the world.
If I had my way, I would get drunk and stay that way, until I die.
Yes, I know that is no answer and I won't do it.
But, I am overwhelmed with anger, unhappiness, and hate for people like my birth mother, father, and most people around me.
I want my life back, and I can't have that.
That is the worst part of my LBD life.
PS..
I left out the profanity I wanted to put in this post.
Why,  don't know.
One more point;  I am presently taking physical therapy for my instability cause by the LBD.
My neurologist prescribed it.
The evaluation phase illuminated the loss of strength ad balance I have experienced in recent months.
When Linda and I walk at night, I often fall into the wall, even with my cane.
The testing the PT folks did showed a lack of balance that made the Physical Therapist asl if I had a stroke or a brain injury.
This has illuminated to me, how much I have deteriorated.
I was a strong, agile, bull of a man.
I often worked 72 hours straight on the ship to fit guns, stand watches, or accomplish any mission.
I walked on the rolling decks of a destroyer for 20 plus years.
Now, I can't walk  down a carpeted hallway without teetering over into the wall.
Life sucks.

Caregiving times Two (Part 1) Introduction: So much love, so many responsibilities, the unending changes.
How do you work through all that happens when you realize dementia has entered your lives?
Denial?
Heck yah!
Denial is a wonderful cocoon to wrap yourself in while you get a grip on reality.
Some never leave the denial stage, we're not all strong and denial is a soft cushion to hide behind that keeps the fears at bay.
Rage?
Anger?
Heck yah!
If you greet the news "it's dementia" with immediate calm you may want to make an appointment with a psychologist.
Calm does come eventually but very rarely at the beginning... deep turmoil usually comes first.
It's hard to get up smiling when you've been gut kicked.
Bargaining?
Heck yah!
God I'll be the best person ever if you just take away the dementia... but dementia isn't a punishment, it's a disease.
In working through the ramifications of the disease rage and anger recede eventually giving time for hope and acceptance to grow.
Acceptance isn't giving up.
Dylan Thomas' poem "Do not go gentle into that good night... rage, rage against the dying of the light" for he paints a picture of a dementia sufferer bravely fighting to understand dementia, keeping up on research, hoping for a cure, and living in a world that is slowing closing in around them.
That takes guts.
Our hope is that dementia will be cured before our son and grandsons will have to face it.
Don remains the rock in my life, even with dementia he tells me every day he loves me.
I cherish this now because eventually dementia will erase Don's memories of me.
It is inspiring to see Don help others through the disease as he leads the Dementia Support Group and as he continues to help me with life's daily burdens and cares.
Caregiving:            So that leads to the Caregiving aspects of the disease.
The one you love (be it a grandparent, parent, spouse, or whomever) needs you to be a caregiver.
Caregiver?
Uh-oh!
Me?
I faint at the sight of blood.
I cave at the first sign of adversity.
I can't do CPR.
I can't find my own keys!
I'm not ready, I don't know what to do.
What is a caregiver any way, do they need a license?
I had a good teacher in Don... he was a wonderful caregiver in the times I needed him.
He sensed when I became overwhelmed and took over.
When my father passed away after five years of living with Alzeheimers I was a mess, I couldn't cope with the grief, the paperwork, the arrangements... I was overwhelmed.
Don took care of it all, making all the arrangements and talking me through the grief.
He was there for me when I had my car accident.
He came alongside me and once again helped me navigate through it all.
I'm sure there are plenty of definitions of "caregiver" and various ideas of what they do.
Synonyms:  loved one, rock, trusted, assistant, helper, companion, advocate, encourager, helpmate to name just a few.
As everything in their world is falling apart from the inside out, family, friends, and acquaintances become strangers.
The dementia patient feels animosity, mistrust and fear toward nearly everyone in their lives but not their caregiver.
They trust their caregiver and know they are safe with them.
A caregiver is the most trusted person in the dementia person's life.
Each caregiver is different, we all come with our own unique personality, characteristics, and skill sets.
I'm not an empathetic person I tend toward facts, to-do lists, and action.
Touchy-feely just isn't me.
The diagnosis of dementia didn't turn Don into an instant invalid and I didn't become a nursemaid to him.
I encouraged him to do things on his own as long as he could and then I have slowly taken over tasks he can no longer do.
I set up his blog so he could journal his dementia journey.
I do things in the background for him while keeping him as active as he can be.
I see Don as an active vital man that doesn't need babied, just loved, supported and cherished.
As a caregiver: *      I have learned to have radar - I feel Don's agitation just before it bubbles over, so I try to smooth situations before they happen.
*      I never lie to Don.
Telling the truth allows his trust to exist and grow.
*      I have learned to develop more empathy because my "just the facts" attitude sometimes makes Don feel like I don't care.
*      I have learned to listen to Don and try to see things from his perspective.
Don needs to feel he is not alone on this journey.
Trying to understand the things that trouble him or bring him joy is vital to keeping in touch with his inner world.
*      I can defuse situations when I understand the triggers that cause them and find ways to control them.
o  Triggers can be almost anything, such as too many activities, too much noise, me driving too fast, heavy traffic, etc.
As Don goes further into dementia, he is getting more agitated and confused.
Episodes of shouting or cussing or confusion are becoming more the norm than they have been before.
We work through the agitation trying to pinpoint the triggers that cause the outbursts and then try to avoid the sensory overload that causes it.
It's a balancing act.
It is living life in neutral.
High points are great, but they lead to deep lows so we try to keep things on an even keel.
So right about now you're probably wondering where is the "times two" portion of this article?
Stay tuned for the next installment!

Yes, that is correct.
I threw three pot today!
A few months ago we went on an organized trip to a museum with the promise of making some "Pinch Pots".
The pot making was fin and I saw some wheels in the facility for "Throwing" pots and I told Linda I would like to do that.
She found a wonderful organization here in Pensacola called "First City Art Center" that offers instruction in many forms of art.
Glass Blowing, Pot Throwing, other pottery forms, to name a few.
She signed me up for a two hour introductory course court that met today.
There could have been three students.
But, I was the only one, so I had one on one instruction from a wonderful instructor named Pearl.
She was a delight!
She not only was an accomplished artist but she was a very patient teacher!
She went step by step, corrected my numerous mistakes and even bailed me out of some serious issues with "Centering"!
I had a wonderful time and I managed to make three different pots.
Two bowls and a flower pot.
Pearl will glaze them, and fire them and then call us when they are complete!
What a great experience!!
How did I do.
Pretty well!
I am very tired right now and I know bed is not far off.
But for almost three hours, I was able to pay attention, perform her instructions to a fairly good level and make a product I am proud of.
But, I am mentally and physically beat!
I did not eat dinner because I did not want to be with anyone.
I need to be alone, in the quiet of the "Cabin".
It was good to do something I have never done before.

I have written about this topic before and recently, but it is getting more and more difficult for me to leave the confines of Azalea Trace.
Just getting in the car and going on the roads causes me agitation.
People just can't drive!!
They text, talk, eat, do anything but pay attention to the road around them.
And, if there is a stop light, forget it!
They zone out.
Then there is the destination.
A doctor's office, any type, is painful at best.
People talking, all around me.
Mostly stupid people.
You would not believe the conversations I hear!
Ignorant people trying to make sense of simple things!
I am surprised they are potty trained!!
Maybe they aren't!!!
I am not trying to be humorous here.
These are my REAL thoughts!
And those thoughts cause me to get angry, frustrated, and very anxious.
I once was an extrovert.
I was energized by crowds of people.
Now, I want to be alone, with just a few people I know, like and trust, if anyone.
Again, the NUEDEXTA helps me control the anger.
But it does not reduce it.
So, I am left frustrated and agitated.
That makes me tired, and running for the "Cabin".
The bottom line is, my experience with LBD is moving into a more difficult phase.
Even Zeus, our 4 year old Chihuahua knows it.
He clings to me when we are together and now demands to spend nights with me in the "Cabin".
He knows something other deny.
Thank goodness my Wife understands this.
But, she is the only one.
Today, Linda had an eye exam.
I waited in the very busy waiting room.
There had to be 25 people in there.
Most of them dumber than rocks!
All talking loud about things they had no knowledge of.
They could not even pronounce words right.
A woman was trying to tell a fellow her granddaughter was in Suffolk, Virginia.
At least that is what I got out of her statements.
He did not understand her and she said Suffolk like it was a soap brand.
So, I moved seats, to deal with a woman with a young girl doing splits on the carpet and making a vied of it with her description of what she was doing, on a smart phone.
Trust me, the phone was way smarter that her, or the adult!
In anywise, I sat there for an hour!
When my Wife was done, all I could say was; Take me home!
I am all for intelligence tests for voting!

Yes, it appears to work.
I have had two very good naps and one night's very deep, restful, sleep.
I do not toss and turn as much as I did before the weighted blanket, so I sleep deeper.
As a matter of fact, I did not get up once last night, that I remember.
Now, this is only the second night of sleeping with my new weighted blanket so we will see if the success continues.
but so far, so good.
Tonight, when we went out for our nightly walk, around 7PM, we ran into large groups of people coming back from the dinning room.
They were loudly talking and having a good time.
The group had visitors and they were touring the facilities.
They walked slowly, blocking the hallways and not paying attention to anything or anyone around them.
Now that I have set the scene, picture me and my Wife, trying to walk for exercise!
We diverted to another direction but ran into more revelers.
We made more u-turns and still ran into congestion.
We finally moved to eh second floor and the crowds thinned out.
But by then, I was agitated.
It is not that those people were doing anything wrong.
They were having a good time with their family and friends.
The issues is how LBD impacted me when there is noise, groups of people, and disturbances to my routine.
It is ME that has to make adjustments not the others.
I realize that now, that I am calmed down, sitting in "The Cabin".
I told Linda I needed to spend more time in "The Cabin" and less time exposed to people.
She is beginning to understand that.
I realize she wants me to be as "Normal" as possible.
Do things we always did, go places, see things.
But more and more, that is becoming a bridge too far.
I was not agitated enough to get violent tonight.
Just agitated enough to be bad company.
More and more, I realize LBD is winning.
And I feel so alone in this battle.
My wife does her best.
But there is no support group for LBD caregivers near us, nor is there a support group for LBD patients.
There is no support groups for Dementia patients or caregivers in our area either.
We have the support group we started here at Azalea Trace, but I am the facilitator of the group, so I get very little help from the group.
As a matter of fact, I am exhausted when the group is done.
We have no staff involvement, even though it was promised a long time ago.
Covenant Care stop supporting us over a year ago.
So, we are on our own.
Maybe that is why I feel so alone in my journey.

I was watching TV with my Wife and a commercial for "Thunder Shirts" for dogs came on.
I blurted out; "Someone needs to invent a product like that for Dementia patients!"
My beautiful, intelligent wife said;  "Look it up on the Internet!"
I did and it lead me to a night of research.
I had heard of weighted blankets before but I dismissed it as junk science.
A gimmick!!
Boy am I wrong.
I discovered that it has been extensively researched and weighted blankets help many of us with anxiety, blood pressure, agitation, and calming down to go to sleep.
People with Dementia, Parkinson's, Restless Leg Syndrome, Autism, and Turrets Syndrome to name a few, have benefited from the weighted blanket.
Even the National Institutes for Health recommend this therapy.
Let me make one IMPORTANT note here!!!
NIH and others recommend you check with your doctor BEFORE using a Weighted Blanket!!
Much of what I read said weighted blankets and throws were good for sleep and lounging in recliners or on the couch.
There is even a formula based on the person's body weight for the amount of weight in the blanket.
I purchased one, received it very quickly,  and I took a nap under it today.
It is calming, relaxing, and after I adjusted to the weight of the blanket, very comfortable.
Tonight will be my first night of sleep with the weighted blanket, so we will see if I really sleep longer, deeper, and better.
As I have written before, there is much information about what we are experiencing on the Internet.
Some of it is JUNK.
But much of it is vetted and good for us to investigate.
Look for recognized sources and numerous endorsements from accredited medical organizations before your try anything.
And, check with your Doctor!!
Will this help me?
We will see.

As I have written before, my best friend Jerry has been my lifeline as long as I can remember.
We talk every week for at least an hour.
Mostly we talk Navy things.
Our Navy!
Sometimes football or other things of interest, but mostly Navy Gunner'a Mate talk.
Then there is my very good friend, Doc Wolf.
He and I were on the USS Stein together and he calls me to cheer me up and get me on track often.
He put me in contact with a now, not so young, fellow Stein shipmate, who called me today.
We were on the phone for an hour!
Steve was a young, misunderstood, Gunner's Mate when I came aboard the Stein as a GMG1  It was my second tour on Stein and things were pretty bad when I returned.
The GMG1 I was relieving was incompetent and self centered!
And the young Gunner's Mates that worked for him suffered because of it!
I quickly discovered that everyone was very wrong about Steve.
Yes, he had his own way of doing things.
But, it worked!
He did great work, on time!
He was dependable, eager to learn, and had great value to the Navy!
I realized he was someone the Navy needed to keep!
As it turned out, Steve found out he and the Navy were a good fit.
He reenlisted, went to Mk 13 Mod 4 Guided Missile Launcher school.
made Chief, then later, Warrant Officer and retired from the Navy as a CWO4 after 26 years of very successful Naval service!
I had very little to do with his wonderful, successful career, except realizing how great a Sailor and Gunner's Mate he really was.
Of course, a blind man on a galloping horse should have seen that!!
I am very proud of Steve and honored he called me today.
He made me feel better than all of the drugs and therapy I endure.
It was a great day!

<doc date=Saturday, June 8, 2019>
On the outside, it appears I have had a fairly successful life.
Had a good Navy Career.
Accomplished some good, even interesting things.
I do have a wonderful, beautiful, very intelligent wife.
Our son is a success in the computer industry and he has brought me much happiness and pride.
So, you would think, my mind would be filled with the good things of my life.
But nights, are evil for me.
My mind continuously runs replays of all my failures, all my mistakes, the very difficult times of my childhood, the times I made mistakes, did not do what I should have, and every other bad event in my life.
Every night, I am tortured by my short comings and failures!!
Those thoughts tell me I failed GOD and my family as well as the Navy.
Those thoughts tell me I was an unwanted mistake of my unwed Mother.
They tell me I am worthless, unwanted, and abandoned.
They play over and over in my mind until I finally fall asleep after hours of tossing and turning.
Each night, real events of my past from as far back as 3 years old are played out in my mind as if they had just occurred!
They are real to me in that moment and the pain, embarrassment, guilt, and rejection, flood over me in explosive waves.
Seldom do I just go to sleep.
There are almost always mental arguments, insults, regrets, mental recriminations, and all the anxiety and depression these thoughts bring me.
I know it is the LBD torturing me.
But that does not help.
Sometimes, after a couple of hours of tossing and turning, I get up and play games on the computer to try to get my mind off of my past failures.
But as soon as I get back in bed, BANG!
!, the bad thoughts attack me again, and again, and again.
This has increased in recent months and is now very difficult to combat.
I do not know what the answer is.
Maybe there is not an answer.
LBD is more than memory loss, difficulty moving, and orthostatic hypotension.
It is mental torture that comes when I am most defenseless.
This is the first time I have openly disclosed this issue, in any manner.
I hope being open helps others deal with their inner tortures, if they have them.

<doc date=Friday, June 7, 2019>
I read an article yesterday, about a long term Miami Newscaster that committed suicide because he thought he had LBD!
He was in his mid-fifties.
His mother died of LBD and he had another relative with LBD.
Of course, you remember Robin Williams committing suicide because he also had LBD.
I know as well as anyone the personal impact of LBD.
From the time the first symptoms show up, your life is permanently, irreversibly, changed!
Everyday, something changes in your ability to remember, do things, communicate, walk, interact with people, and even be intimate with your spouse.
Soon, you have to stop working because you simply cannot do what you once did.
Driving is a thing of the past, as is the freedom to do what you want when you want.
I can't even get a haircut when I want to!
But, the most maddening thought is that things will only get worse!
And I believe it is that thought that drives people with LBD to suicide.
But, there is hope.
I still believe being in a support group, surrounded by other Dementia patients, is encouraging, and empowering.
Discussing how we overcome our issues, laughing at the things that we encounter helps me, and others, cope with this disease.
The story about the Miami Newscaster hit me hard.
I believe suicide is not an option.
I know mutual support from other Dementia survivors is.
Look, I have spent many quiet hours alone, thinking about this issue.
I believe I am tougher than LBD, as long as I depend on GOD to get me through it.
I cannot face this disease alone and GOD helps me everyday.
But HE also places people in my path that help me.
I encourage you to seek GOD first.
And then you will see all the support HE has provided.
LBD is tough, but we are tougher.

I personally believe there are not enough opportunities for those of us with Dementia's of any type, to get together and discuss our personal reflections of our disease.
Being together, openly discussing our personal issues, in a secure, non-attribution environment is therapeutic and cleansing.
Each of us have many issues we are dealing with.
Many insecurities caused by our Dementia journey.
Discovering that another person has similar issues, fears, concerns, and experiences, helps us understand the we are NORMAL!
Yes, we are normal, considering the disease we are impacted with.
Cancer patients have support groups at just about every hospital in the country.
Alcoholics and drug addicts and even over weight individuals have support groups.
And individuals impacted by Dementia, and their care givers, need support groups too.
We started such a group here at Azalea Trace three years ago.
We are still going strong, supporting each other, and acting as sounding boards for each other's issues.
Some of our founding members have passed away.
Others are now too far along in their journey to attend our weekly meeting.
But we have gained new members and we will continue to grow because we meet each other's needs.
You do not need a professional to start a group.
All you need is a will to help others.
The National Institute of Health has numerous pamphlets about most Dementia's and also regarding care giving and research.
The Alzheimer's Association and the Lewy Body Dementia Association are also full of information you can use to educate Dementia patients and their caregivers.
Another great asset is a book titled, "The 36 Hour Day".
I have also found that local attorneys, doctors, nurse practitioners, and psychologists are all wiling to address groups of Dementia patients and their caregivers.
I strongly encourage you to start a support group in your area if there is not one already in progress.
If there is one, join it!You will be enriched and comforted by the camaraderie.
On a personal note;  Our group is a lifeline for me and Linda.
Everyone in the group has so much personal experience to relate to the other members of the group.
When one of us has an issue, and finds a solution to that issue, we share it wit the group so the others do not have to "reinvent the wheel" when they encounter the problem.
It is amazing how many times we answer issues before the occur.
I am indebted to each member of our group.
The have kept me going!!
Thanks.

If you have read my ramblings for any time you know I am dissatisfied,  in general, with those who pose as Medical professionals.
Yes, there are some, maybe even many, who do the best they can.
But most do only what is required to stay employed and to keep from being sued.
Recently, my GP became somewhat concerned over my blood work.
Over the last 18 months and three routine blood tests I have shown anemia!
For 17 of those months, she said it was nothing to worry about.
Just a small lowering of those levels.
No big deal.
Then, this week, she tells me the numbers tell her I am loosing about 1/2 pint of blood a day!
That seem significant to me.
My reply was, look at my colon since I had half of it removed 18+ years ago and the cancer may have returned.
She agreed but ordered another blood test for that day.
The next day, the assistant called me and said, no problems, the new blood test said I was not anemic and allay levels were normal!
Really?!
Three previous tests over 18 months say there is an issue and one, non-fasting test says I am fine?!!
Something is fishy in Denmark!
I guess we will wait until we see rivers of blood running out of me from one orfice or another.
Just like the neurologist-psych cognitive tests my Wife took and reported she is perfect normal, even tough she cannot do basic math, drives on the wrong side of the road and gets totally confused at the drop of a hat!!
My new approach to doctors, is to avoid them as much as I can.
The Hippocratic Oath used to say; First do no HARM.
Now it says; First, DO NOTHING!

Recently, I have been more confused and disconnected from the environment I live in.
I am more and more dependent on my routine.
If that routine is changed or interrupted, I am off track for the remainder of the day.
For instance, because of scheduling issues, I had to be i up and ready about 30 minutes earlier than I normally am.
I got up, started my morning routine, but things just did mot go smoothly.
When I got in the shower, I forgot the washcloth.
I did not want to ope the shower curtain because of water on the floor, so I did not wash my face.
After I got dressed, I went to breakfast, and where i usually sit was full, so I did not eat breakfast.
I then went to my Wife's apartment to meet the scheduled activities and from then on, I have been totally out of sorts.
Again, I am very routine driven and my morning was completely different.
We have noticed this more lately.
Any change causes me to loose mental connectivity and get more agitated and confused.
Nothing seems to reset my clock, except starting another day.
Recently, because of these issues I was agitated and started yelling and cussing at a sport aviation aircraft that buzzes our community.
Another resident heard me.
Not my problem.
The bottom line is, issues are getting worse and I don't care who knows.
Words come more difficult and I find myself feeling lost walking around our community.
Not that I can't get where I want to go, but nothing looks familiar to me.
Strange, but probably normal.
I don't know when my next neurologist appointment is, but it will probably be interesting!

Our son is coming over today to celebrate Mother's Day with Linda.
She is a wonderful, nurturing, Mom and an even better Grandmother!
As I look back at all she endured during our young married years, I am amazed at her strength, fortitude, and dedication.
Nothing fazed her!
And remember, I was deployed much of those years, so she was on her own!
However, I now look at the daunting task she has dealing with me as my Wife and my caregiver.
Being the spouse of a Dementia patient is never easy, comfortable, or enjoyable.
Yet, she seems to find happiness in every moment we spend together.
I am truly blessed to have Linda as my Wife.
As my days get more difficult, she will share the burden of my care, frustration, and confusion.
We will make the best of the good moments and ignore the difficult ones, as best we can.
That is our plan to survive the remainder of my, no  OUR  Lewy Body journey.
Happy Mother's Day my Love!
You are my inspiration!

 My last two or three semi-annual blood work up have shown increasing anemia.
Now, I eat plenty of meat!!
I eat ice cream.
And I eat broccoli.
But, now my GP wants to go on a fishing expedition to see if I am bleeding internally.
My guess is that I am.
But, I do not see any signs of that externally.
But, I am color blind, so brown solid waste could have red blood in it and I would not know.
And NO, I am not asking the nurses to check my poop!
I did have a large tumor at eh place in my colon where the small intestine dumps into the colon, 18 years ago.
That resulted in me having half of my colon removed.
Everything has worked fine since then.
But, it would not be out of the question to have another tumor show up.
I did have a colonoscopy three years ago with no issues.
But, those things can grow fast.
My guess is she has another colonoscopy planned for my future.
I have had too many of them since the tumor was found 18 years ago.
I am somewhat reticent to go through this process again.
I see the GP later this month.
We will see what her plans are and then I will decide.
Since surgery is not the best thing for Dementia patients, this may be a complicated decision.

A reader, sent me a comment asking me to reflect on the beginning of my LBD journey.
I did, and it caused me to reflect on where I am now.
This disease is kicking my ass!
If this were a bar room fight, I would give up.
I am defeated.
I have always been the tough guy.
I took the tough assignments.
Raised my hand for anything that no one else wanted to do.
In Gun Mounts, I was the person who did the dangerous stuff.
I was on the ship's fire fighting team, full Damage Control Qualified, actually tough small shipboard fires and flooding.
I volunteered as a GS to take overseas jobs in combat zones.
I pushed myself to work hurt, come back from surgeries faster, and was a tough as I could possibly be.
I went through a windshield in a car accident and worked on the ship the next day!
But, I am defeated and I admit it.
As I  said in the last post, I am not who I was.
That was not an easy thing to say.
I stilling to move to that concrete home on 20 acres.
But, I know that will never be.
I often look at myself in the mirror, or in retrospect and ask myself;  How did I get this old!?
Lewy Body Dementia has defeated me.
I quit.
I give up.
I need to spend the majority of my time in "The Cabin" isolated from anyone or any event that will cause me to loose my temper.
I need, no, I MUST HAVE my routine to function.
I cannot deal with people anymore.
It is time for me, to be isolated.
Once, I enjoyed the energy generated by crowds of people.
I enjoyed public speaking engagements.
Parties, banquets, conventions.
Now, I want to be left alone for the most part.
Yes, I still enjoy visits from friends and families.
And I long for more of those.
But people in general are an annoyance to me.
I am not the man I once was.
And I finally recognize that.
LBD had won.

<doc date=Saturday, May 4, 2019>
I was with the United States Navy for 40 years.
Twenty years as an Enlisted Man, a Gunner's Mate, retiring as a Master Chief (E-9).
Then I became a GS, Civil Servant, first working on Gun Mounts and Turrets, and then promoting into management, for another 20 years.
That 40 years was very stressful with constant deployments, trips to foreign places, and combat tours.
Late in my Civil Servant career, when I was a Branch Head of the Search Radar, Electronic Navigation, Precision Aircraft Landing Systems, Branch, I was driving home, stuck in Norfolk Virginia traffic on Interstate 64.
Dead stopped in the traffic, listening to talk radio, and all of the sudden, I did not know where I was, where I was going, or where I came from!
It lasted a few minutes and then passes.
I figured it was the result of stress and did not tell my Wife.
Linda and I BOTH knew something was wrong.
I did not feel like my brain worked like it once did.
I was kn ow in the Gunner's Mate Community for having near TOTAL RECALL of facts, electronic prints, hydraulics, and mechanical functions of many Gun Mounts and Turrets.
All that was going away and we both knew it.
Also, during this period, but I do not remember exactly when, I developed hallucinations.
I saw things, very distinct things, that obviously were not there.
I also developed REM sleep disorder.
Or, acting out my dreams!
I actually punched my Wife in the head during one of these episodes.
I also had some shaking in my hands and later developed walking issues that are much worse today.
A couple of weeks or more later, I had the same thing happen.
I then thought something was wrong and told my Wife.
She sent me to my GP who was a fantastic doctor.
He in turn, sent me to a Neurologist.
After a long series of tests, exams, ad trips in the MRI/CT tube, she sent me to the University of Virginia  where they did the same thing!
Then the Neurologist gave me some drugs and told my Wife to watch me.
I had reactions to that drug or those drugs and that gave the Neurologist a BIG clue as to what was going on.
After all that, she told us I had Lewy Body Dementia.
So, that is how we came to be diagnosed with LBD.
The journey has been slow but has now picked up steam.
I hope this helps others.

Dementia care has two sides.
How the facility deals with the person with dementia, and how it deals with residents without dementia.
If you have dementia and are fortunate enough to live in a community that does NOT co-mingle dementia residents with non dementia patients, this does not apply to you.
But where I live, the do co-mingle dementia and nob-dementia patients and they are not very good at it!
Case in point, today;  It is now almost 10 PM.
after a three hour nap, a four mile walk with my Wife, and a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, I am calm.
Not yet over my anger, but manageable.
I discussed the events of the early afternoon with a senior LPN here and she gave me some insight into how things unfolded.
It seems the resident who's relative caused my pain really needs to be moved to Skilled Care.
But, she and the family are against it.
Who the Hell is in charge here!!!
She disrupts others lives and caused me to go High Order, and her rights are important!!!
The community I live in lives in corporate fear of the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA).
There are people living in Independent Living with 24/7/365 care givers.
They cannot walk, feed themselves or go to the bathroom.
How is that Independent Living?!
There are people living in Assisted Living in the same condition, with 24/7/365 care givers.
Again, that is not what Assisted Living is for.
Assisted means you need some assistance, not 24 hour care.
But, management seems hamstrung by some asshole attorney's view of the ADA!!
That is not what the ADA was passed for.
Having people in AL that are a nuisance to others is unfair to the rights of those who actually qualify for AL.
The same can be said for Independent Living.
If I live in a a facility that is supposed to be populated with able, mobile, self-sufficient people, but is instead, populated with invalids, my rights are being violated!!
However, in the AL scenario, mix Dementia residents in and it becomes a total mess.
In my case, I moved to AL to have a quiet, calm, atmosphere without noises that agitate me!!
Remember me, I chased the so called security guards around the first floor of IL one night because they were not doing their job!
One of them quit and one totally avoids me now.
Chicken!
Not to mention the FEDEX driver.
I NEED quiet.
And a screeching witch in the room across from me does not qualify as quiet and calm.
Azalea Trace, and ACTS must solve this issue.
The must place people in the level of care they require, not what they or their family want.
Regardless of how much money they have or how much political pull they can muster.
If management neglects their responsibilities in these matter, it may not be pretty.

Yesterday, my Wife and I took an organized trip planned by our retirement community.
A three hour bus ride to an Art Museum.
"yippee"   From my prospective, I would rather watch grass grow or paint dry.
After the art torture, we went to a Pub for lunch.
14 senior citizens, at a Bar, having lunch.
Nothing could go wrong there?
Right?!?
Then another three hour bus ride home.
Let me give you my review.
I hate old women!!
They never did anything constructive in their lives.
The think they know everything and are not bashful about telling you or anyone else your wrong!
Nothing is ever right in their world!!!
The piss and moan about anything and every thing and they know a better way to do it!
By the way, there were three men, counting me, on the trip and not one of us complained.
Of course, we could not have gotten a word in edgewise!
Some of the old women complained the trip was too long.
Some of the old women complained the food was too greasy!
Hell, they ordered fried food in a Bar!
What did they expect?!?
When I got home I was exhausted, from fighting to keep my mouth shut and restraining myself from beating the shit out of these people that have lived too long, for no good reason.
My Wife spent her time patting my hand and trying to calm me.
Linda and I decided we will NEVER take another organized trip again.
It is not worth the aggravation, or the risk!

I am having more noticeable, disruptive, stability issues.
I have been stumbling more, tipping backwards, and when I walk, sometimes the hall way looks like the deck of a Destroyer, pitching back and forth.
Yes, I see the flood tilting left and right!
Hey, that makes me feel at home!!
But, it is not conducive to stability on dry ground.
I have not fallen, yet.
But it has been tough and go a couple of times.
It is not because of strength and we walk nearly every day, three to five miles!
But, I am becoming more unstable, especial in the transition from sitting to standing or changing directions when I am moving slow.
I am not sure what this means.
But, it means something.
Kind of like what a Gunner's Mate who worked for me used to say;  I don't know what's happening, but it's happening FAST!"

<doc date=Saturday, April 6, 2019>
It amazes me that individuals will not talk about health issues.
Women still talk about uterine cancer as a female issue!
Men will not discuss prostate cancer!
And ED is reserved for dirty jokes.
And when a person begins to show Dementia symptoms, it is covered up like they got VD from a hooker!!
And not only the person with the Dementia issues covers it up but their Spouse as well!
Look, all diseases MUST be brought into the light of day to insure the patient gets the best care and the caregiver makes the best decisions for the patient, their loved one.
Where I live, I have become the Dementia point of contact for the residents!
We started the Dementia Support Group, but now people who think they may have issues seek me out, secretly, quietly, to ask questions.
Many WILL NOT see a Neurologist.
Just like people hide UTI's!!
They think it will get better if I bring cranberry juice or in the case of Dementia, if I read more, move more, take whatever is advertised on late night TV.
But, most likely none of this will work!
So, they get worse, their spouse gets more stressed, and in both cases, they normally end up in the hospital, or dead.
If you are diagnosing yourself, you have a FOOL for a patient!!
With the new medicines ready to be released in the next few years, a accurate diagnosis IS the key to proper treatment and possible a cure of Alzheimer's.
Yes, look up BAN 2401 on the Internet!
It is VERY promising for stopping Alzheimer's in it's tracks.
It has not been tested for other dementia, but Alzheimer's is 70% of all Dementia, so this is big.
My last few posts have been caused by what I see where I live.
I am frustrated with the residents and the organization.
There is so much that can be done to make the lives of Dementia patients and their caregivers good, enjoyable, less stressful, and easier.
But, we have to admit we have an issue, and be willing to openly discuss it with others.
And we MUST seek out help and knowledge!
Or, we can hide in the closet and die a terrible death alone, and most likely kill our spouse because of stress!

I live in a Continuing Care Retirement Community that is filled with well off people.
No welfare cases here!
And as in any retirement community, there are any number of people with various diseases.
Some that are fast in their attack and sure in their outcome, like Cancer.
Others that come on suddenly and unexpectedly, like broken hips.
And the ones we all see others having to deal with but we hope we never will, like Dementia and Parkinson's.
I have observed the way spouses deal with their loved one's diagnoses.
I have seen people work through the Five Stages of Grief: "denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance".
And, I have observed something I never expected.
Some people, caregivers, husbands, wives, children, NEVER get beyond stage one or two!
That's correct, they either spend the rest of their loved one's life saying; "There' nothing wrong with Him or Her!"
Or they spent the remainder of their loved one's life terribly angry at them for getting the disease they have!
I have seen spouses treat their Dementia impacted spouse like it was their fault they were sick.
Some actually abandon their spouse to skilled care!
That's right, they seldom visit them!
Others are actually mean to their sick spouse.
Both verbally and I believe sometimes physically.
And others deny their spouse medical equipment that might ease their suffering.
The excuse I have hears is that thing costs too much!!
A long time ago, when my Father in Law was dealing with Alzheimer's and was in a Nursing Home, we met a wife of another Alzheimer's patient and she was continually angry at her husband!
Everything was HIS FAULT!
But she was most angry because they money was going to his care!
She wanted to travel and could not because of HIM!!
No one plans to get a disease.
It happens.
And, spouses, husbands or wives, all took the same wedding vow.
"In sickness or in health, until death due us part."
I actually believe some spouses are glad their ailing spouse is dead!
It is like; "Finally, I can get on with MY LIFE!
This attitude hurts me when I observe it.
I have never commented about the attitude and I hope I never do.
And yes, I understand how GRIEF can ruin the best persons attitude and the best relationship.
But, if you truly love someone, I due not understand how you could deny them anything in their time of need.
But, I am old fashion and out of step with today's society.
And boy am I glad that I am!

OK, Can we talk, frankly?
All of us have to stop doing things we like to do because of LBD.
Many of them involve our independence, like driving, going somewhere alone and independently, even bathing, dressing, and feeding ourselves as the disease gets worse.
Trust me, I know folks here where I live that can no longer feed themselves.
It is a possible issue for all of us.
Some of the things we have to give up are things that give us pleasure.
Recreational activities we loved.
like golf, tennis, or for me, shooting.
But one that may be a big issue for some of us is SEX.
I have written before that I can no longer have sex because it just does not work.
I believe it is a combination of the effects of Effexor, (that nasty, insidious, drug that does not work for me and does work against me!)
and the effects of LBD.
In any case, I am completely OUT of the sex game and it bothers me!!
Up until now, I had always held out hope that I would be able to perform at some level if I got off Effexor.
Now, I know that was a fantasy unto itself.
My sex life is over.
This is not how I pictured my late 60's to be.
But, it is what it is.
However, mentally dealing with the reality is more difficult than I had ever imagined.
And before you write me and tell me about those magic pills...
They don't work for me, AT ALL!
I tried them with no success.
So, I need to work on accepting this as the new normal.
I will let you know how that works out.

It has been accurately said about me, that I have all the Tact GOD gave me.
I have NEVER used any of it.
And, that is based in some fact.
I have always been an opinionated, loud mouthed, asshole.
Especially when I know that I am RIGHT!
A persons seniority.
never made a difference to me.
If I thought they were wrong, I told them.
If they disagreed, I told them in a more descriptive manner!
Admiral, Senator, Captain of a Ship, if they were wrong, they got told so!
And, as I got senior in the Navy, I became known for Flame Spraying anyone who crossed me.
I can tell you stories that will shock some of you and make others laugh until you wet your pants.
But recently, I have really lost control of my social graces.
It occurs mostly when I am tired or overwhelmed.
And, I HAVE actually embarrassed myself, if that is possible.
The real point of this post is, I am loosing control of my emotions and the things that anger me come out, in flaming words that WILL make any REAL Fleet Sailor blush.
How do I or how can I deal with this issue.
Let's look at a few ways.
Don't get tired.
Don't get overwhelmed.
Don't talk to stupid people!
Don't leave the "Cabin"!
No-one said LBD was going to be easy.
But up to now it was relatively easy.
Now things are getting tough and I need everyone around me to understand that.
But, they still don't.
Or at least I don't think they do.
But that may be me and not them.

<doc date=Tuesday, March 19, 2019>
As most of you know, I live in Assisted Living and my Wife lives in Independent Living.
We spend our days together although I am spending more time in The "Cabin" my Assisted Living hide away lately.
I moved into AL because of my agitation and anger issues caused by noise and people.
My wife is still very active.
She constantly had projects she is working on and is up until all hours of the night.
She loves to have the Television on, just for the background noise.
She is up and down, walking or pacing all over the apartment.
It is how she thinks and relaxes.
As my LBD progressed that caused me issues.
Coupled with the noise of people having parties in the hallway outside of our apartment, and other issues I have discussed in the past, my Medical team, the Azalea Trace management, and my Wife and I decided me moving to AL was a necessary thing.
That was a year ago and I believe it was good for me and her too.
However, today, as we were taking our daily exercise walk, she opened up about how me spending more and more time alone in the Cabin has impacted her.
She realizes I need that time to maintain my composure and mental health.
But, it hurts her to have me leave in the early afternoon and not return until after dinner.
Now, I am not out drinking, I am asleep from 2 to 4:30.
Then I eat dinner and take my night pills and return to walk with her and watch some television.
Then, I leave again between 7:30 and 8 PM..
I need and enjoy quiet.
I seldom have the television on in the "Cabin".
No radio, no music, just quiet and Solitaire on the IPAD until I am tired enough to sleep.
Of course, since I moved to The "Cabin" I have not chased any Security Guards down hallways yelling and cussing at them for being incompetent nor have I PUNCHED any delivery personnel for speeding on the Campus!
But those positive issues do not mitigate the fact that I am away from the woman I love so dearly.
She has the most difficult part of my disease,  She is watching me fade away bodily and mentally.
I cannot do what I once could and  am a shadow of myself cognitively.
I search for words, forget my points in conversations and constantly talk about the past.
I am moody, angry, and pretty much useless as a husband.
Yet, she treats me with loving kindness, tries desperately to understand, and is always looking for ways to make my life easier and more fulfilled.
We communicate constantly about the issues of this LBD journey.
And every time we talk, I feel her hurt.
I wish I could help.
This is the hardest part of my disease.

My third attempt to rid myself of the prescription poison called Effexor has ended in defeat.
I have written before that a doctor who called himself a neurologist in Pensacola, who has an orange bill for a mouth and white feathers on his body, has me taking 240 mg of Effexor a day!
My present Neurological practice reduced me to 75mg a day.
Recently on the advice of another doctor, I tried to get completely off Effexor.
As I was told to do, and as I described to my Neurologist practice, I went from 75mg to 37.5 mg per day for three weeks.
Then to half of that a day for another three weeks.
All without any side effects like Brain Zapping.
So, I thought, I could stop Effexor all together and that is where the wheels fell off the cart!
Brain zapping and other side effects took over.
I went to 9mg a day and then back to 18 mg per day and the brain zapping reduced but stayed with me.
I contacted my Neurologist practice and they directed me to go back on one pill, 37.5 mg, a day.
They told me I may not be able to stop Effexor, ever.
No doctor practicing medicine in the US should be able to prescribe a medicine for a patient that they cannot get off !!!
The side effects of Effexor for me are terrible.
Furthermore, it does not mitigate my depression.
In fact, it makes m Depression worse!!
But, it appears, I am stuck.

<doc date=Sunday, March 10, 2019>
What I posted yesterday was real time!
I wrote exactly what I was going through, without filter.
That is my promise to myself and to you.
LBD hurts, physically, cognitively, and more importantly mentally!
I am hurting mentally right now.
Thank GOD I have a scheduled appointment with my long time Psychologist tomorrow.
I believe that will help.
At least I hope so.
But, I also know we all get abandoned by family and friends.
Look, we are no longer fun to be around.
And then there is my need to have a quiet life in the cocoon I have created, on purpose.
I moved to My Cabin, (Azalea Trace Assisted Living) to prevent me from hurting someone.
I had already punched the FEDEX man for speeding on the campus  and chased the security boys for not doing their job in a professional manner, and I knew it was going to get much worse.
So, I escaped to my own safe room!!
But, that only keeps others safe when I am doing really bad.
I am still getting punched and kicked by my own memories, failings, and emotions about how my life has changed.
And many of you have the same issues or if you are a caregiver, maybe you can see your loved one in my description of my emotions.
I am broke physically and mentally.
My Wife does a great job trying to keep me functioning and trying to smooth out the ruts in my life.
I could NOT ask for more from her.
In the beginning, when we were first diagnosed, she pushed me to be as active and normal as I could be!
I often revolted against her pushing.
But, she was right and it helped me.
Now, she recognizes I need quiet time, alone time, seclusion when I am having a bad day or more.
She really is a blessing to me.
I said yesterday in my post it might be time to retreat.
Don't think I have not given that possibility a lot of deep thought.
I am tired of fighting this battle, knowing it can't be won.
Yet, I still find the strength, through Jesus, My Lord, to go one more round.
But I do not go on with my own strength, but His.
I am spent, completely.

<doc date=Saturday, March 9, 2019>
I am having a BAD night!
I had Zeus over to the cabin tonight and he demanded more attention than I wanted to or could give him.
He got a swat on the butt and taken back to Linda.
She and I discussed my mental issues and that helped me immensely.
But, I am now STILL dealing with my anger and depression.
I  told her and I will now tell you, I have spent my life having people use me, and having people PISS down my neck and tell me it is raining.
Most folks dd not like me, but I was valuable to them because I am talented dedicated and smart,  so, they used me to accomplish their goals, they looked good, they got the awards, and they threw me away, like a piece of garbage.
My Division Head at MARMC, George Cox, was very good at using me for HIS benefit!!
The only person in my life that I can really say is in my corner, is my Wife.
Yes, I can also count on Jerry and Marcia.
But truly, that is it.
Sorry if you are not on this list.
And yes, many of you helped me move many times, helped me do a roof, fix plumbing, remove skylights, fix cars, etc.
But, I did the same for you.
So, we are even.
I am in Florida, against my will.
I was taken here on false pretenses,  I know I cannot move back to Virginia for numerous reasons.
But, I am still a prisoner.
I get visited once in a while.
But, Linda is my only source of comfort and compassion.
I am constantly bombarded by my past failures.
The circumstances of my birth and raising.
Even my failures in my Navy career.
I seldom feel like I succeeded at anything and I seldom feel truly wanted by anyone except my Wife and Jerry and Marcia.
No one, outside of those three individuals try to understand how I feel or how LBD has impacted m life.
I have had so called Doctors tell me I am not sick.
People that do not know me, tell me the same thing.
But I am overwhelmed by what is happening to me and I am quickly becoming unable to cope with these issues.
One of my favorite mental escapes is to mentally build my Concrete Survival home.
I have doe this man, many times.
But not, halfway through the mental constructions, I heard run my mind;  You idiot, you can't do this.
You can't even drive!!
You are broken and dependent on everyone for the simplest daily issues.
Even my brain has deserted me.
I know I am where I will be for the remainder of my life.
I have no control over anything.
This is not how I thought things would be.
But, it is what it is.

<doc date=Thursday, February 21, 2019>
I wish I had a dollar for every time I heard that.
There's nothing wrong with you!!
You're perfectly fine!
Well, no, I am not.
But I put on a great show!!
Women fake orgasms all the time, I am told.
And Dementia patients "FAKE" normal all the time!!
I know this for a fact!!
But inside, we are frightened, angry, lost, confused, and unsure of ourselves.
Furthermore, we feel we cannot trust you, to tell you, how we feel and what is going on in our brain!
That's RIGHT!!
We don't trust you!
The doctor, the psychologist, our kids, our spouses, our friends, our caregivers, the neighbor, the people we worked with,  No one!!
Why, because you keep telling us we have nothing wrong!!
Look, personally, I trust my Wife, and my friend Jerry with everything I feel and experience.
I tell them, express my insecurities, fears, emotions.
They listen and try to understand.
But, I do not tell anyone else all of the truth!!
It is like going to the dentist.
He asks you;  "Do you have any problem areas?"
Nope, everything is just fine!!
In other words, if you can't find it, I'm not telling you!!
And yes, I have posted many personal issues on this forum.
But there are issues I have NEVER discussed.
Because sometimes, I get replies telling me I am a fake!
Which is what people say when they say, you look, sound, act, write, perfectly normal.
So, as a defensive measure, I close up.
Here at Azalea Trace, many residents have told me, in no uncertain terms, that I am a fake!!
Even residents of Assisted Living.
Yes, I had female pastor, (There is no such thing!)
that I was a fake!!
She said she knew how to diagnose Dementia and I did not have it!!
Well, I know how to identify compassion, and observing her interactions with the folks here in Assisted Living, She is a fake!
Just the inner fear Dementia patients experience is more than can be described.
I see it in my Wife as she deals with what her future will surely hold.
Many times at night, when I am alone, in the quiet of my Cabin, I realize this is it!
I will never get better, only worse.
I will never drive again, do anything independent again, or make my own decisions again!!
That reality hits me in the face like a cement wall at 100 miles per hour!!
No helmet, no air bag, just me and the wall,  BANG!!!
And yes, my LBD has progressed slower than some others.
I credit my Neurologist in Virginia, Dr. Bowles, for her quick action in my car.
She used treatments that were previously reserved for mid or late term LBD to slow my progression.
A Neuro-Psychologist here in Pensacola recently told me I would NOT have receive tat good a treatment here.
I obviously was blessed!!
Praise God!
However, the LBD is getting worse and my ability to act normal is no longer sufficient to cover that up.
Linda and I face some very emotional times.
Every Dementia patient and their spouse do the same thing.
So, instead of playing doctor,  try to be empathetic and sympathetic!
It will help us and make you look like a nice person!!
Even if you are not.

A couple of days ago, we received a telephone call from our BEST friends from Virginia Beach.
Marcia opened up the conversation with;  "Would you like a visit?
We are on the road headed your way!"
We spent two days talking and reminiscing about the past and catching up on each other's lives.
What a wonderful surprise.
We toured Azalea Trace and they enjoyed the Outstanding culinary offerings we have everyday.
It was a renewing, wonderful time together.
Yes, it was cool in Pensacola and we did have a typical thunderstorm, but who cares, we were together!
Those three days were the BEST days I have had in a very long time.
Thanks Jerry and Marcia!

When I was having more severe anger issues, before Neudexta, I would spend my nights building in my mind, my concrete house on 10 acres with all sorts of defensive emplacements.
I would fight battles with those who would want to invade my compound.
And I would defeat the aggressors before I could go to sleep.
I have always wanted, longed, dreamed, planned to live a survivalist life.
Of course, it never happened.
But, before Neudexta, and it's calming effect on me, I still tried to cling to that fantasy.
Now I realize that dream is lost.
It is difficult to recognize a dream is lost.
But it is comforting to understand that I now recognize my limitations, caused by LBD.
Reality is harsh, but necessary.
</doc>
<doc date=Wednesday, December 26, 2018>
My Neurologist has tried for a while to get me to try Nudexta for my agitation and anger issues.
I have resisted her numerous attempts.
So, this visit, she took a different approach.
She told me to check on line for the research on Nudexta helping Lewy Body Dementia patients with anger and agitation.
That peaked my interest since these studies were never mentioned to me before and I was not interested in taking a drug to help with a disease.
Did not have.
I did the research and I was surprised to find Nudexta did help in most cases, with LBD anger and agitation issues.
So, I agreed to try it.
Today is my first day on the drug.
You start out a half doses for a week and then go to the full dose, as we do with so many of the drugs we take.
So far, no side effects!!
And, I seem to be less angry and agitated.
Now, that may be the placebo effect so I am reserving judgment until I have been on it a month or so.
But right now, I feel very good, and I have not said that in a long time.
So, we will wait and see.
I will keep you informed.

http://www.lewybodydementia.ca/lewy-body-dementia-phases-and-stages/ I sure hope you can attach to the site shown above.
It is a tremendous review of the symptoms that signify the stages of Lewy Body Dementia.
According to this information, I am completely in Phase 3 and showing a number of significant symptoms of Stage 4.
Not really a surprise but sobering just the same.
I have a planned appointment with our Neurologist's Office this week and it will be interesting since many of these issues have become much more bothersome and serious.
One of the issues I experience is mental trips into various situations or events.
In other words, day dreaming that seems Very REAL to me!
Some of these day dreams are related to my long held desire to build a concrete home on 10 or more acres, and live the survivalist life.
My Wife never shared that dream and it never materialized.
But, I spend hours, especially at night alone in the Cabin, building and maintaining that beautiful 800 Square Foot Survival Bunker!
Other day dreams relate to arguments or outright fights with people I either know or have never met.
Some of them are very violent, others are just debates of points of interest.
Most relate either to me living as a survivalist or relate directly to my Navy career.
Some nights, I just want to sit in my Cabin and SCREAM as loud as I can and beat the walls down or just cry because I am so filled with anger and depression!
Most nights, I toss and turn, living my day dreams, until I finally fall asleep.
And sometimes, I wake up during the night, still living those day dreams!!
Another issue I am having serious problems dealing with is being isolated and alone.
No one, and I mean NO ONE comes to visit me.
It has been Thanksgiving since I have seen my son and he lives 20 minutes away!!
I have nothing in common with the people I live with.
They are rich, snobbish, self-centered liberals that truly believe, no, the are totally convinced their solid waste does not stink!
Being a Retired Enlisted Navy Master Chief does not seem to impress them.
I guess they do not know only 1% of the enlisted personnel can be in Pay grade E-9!!
It is easier to make Admiral in the Navy that it is to make Master Chief!!
And even though I am an Ordained Pastor, the other Pastor's here do not associate with me because I am a "Lay" Pastor.
Of course, I have done Services since I moved in here and none of the Seminary grads of the Liturgical churches have not.
But, they seem to look down on me with disdain.
I even had a female reverend ( small "r" on purpose) tell me I was not a Pastor and that she was ordained by her Seminary and that Churches do not Ordain Pastors.
She needs to read the Bible!
First, there are NO female reverends.
Paul said, women are not to have a position of authority over men in the Church.
Oh yes, and they were to have their heads covered and their mouths SHUT!!
This female reverend does not practice that either.
Remember what my GP said?
I am depressed!!
I am truly finding it difficult to keep it together.
I get very agitated at the smallest things.
Thank God that I have the Cabin to hide in.
This was a life saving move for me.
I need to stay in the Cabin more and travel through the rest of the community less, for my own good.
Or, someone else is going to get the same treatment the Fedex driver got!
I have not unloaded in print in a while and I thought you should know where I was progressing, or digressing to.
And, like I tell the folks in the Dementia Support Group, I am normal!!
Normal for the stage of LBD I am in.
Merry Christmas!

This is more and informative post that certainly relates to me and most with Dementia of any origin.
On the Alzheimer's Association Web Site, (ALZ.ORG) there are two mew articles.
One about traveling with a Dementia patient and the other about how to deal with the Holidays and your Dementia patient.
Both are brief, bright, and relevant.
They are full of information that my Wife and I have had to learn on our own.
Now, it is available to you thanks to Alz.Org.

My GP did one of those leading question quizzes and deduced that I am severely depressed!
No Shit!!
My Wife wants to know why?
Well, let's see;  I went from a self-sufficient, self-assured, confident, WARRIOR, who lead men into battle, to a person who can't even get a haircut without an escort!!
The few things I want to do, I never get to do.
And trust me, there are few things I want to do anymore.
I get angry over trivial things, continually feel like kicking the shit out of most people I see, and I have no one who respects me or understands what I did for 40 years to talk too!
Yes I am depressed and I can only see it getting worse.
The GP wants me to go to a Psychiatrist.
For what?
That Scab Lifter will only want me to take more pills!
NO!!
Not going to happen.
I try very hard to be as calm as I can.
If I am out of control and I know it, I go to "The Cabin" and hide.
That is as good as it can be.
The holidays always are hard for me and this year may present even more challenges.
My Wife dose her very best to mitigate stressors for me but some things are out of her control.

First my Wife.
Her blood work did mot show any abnormalities that would bring on dementia symptoms.
And Her MRI looks fairly normal although some age related small strokes were noted.
So, we wait for the Cognitive Skills testing in February.
She is still having math difficulties along with some instability issues and vision changes.
All things that can be related to the "Silent Strokes" found in her MRI.
But, we have no share diagnosis now.
So, we wait.
In my case, I am definitely getting worse.
I have far more issues with my emotions and anger.
I also have problems finding the dog, Zeus, at night in my Cabin.
Remember, he does not stay nights with me!
But, I hear his whine and wonder where he is.
I feel more confused and disoriented.
Speech is becoming more labored for me.
On the good side, my Wife decided about 4 months ago to loose weight.
She has cut her caloric intake significantly and has US walking 3-5 miles a day, seven days a week.
She has lost almost 40 pounds and I have lost NONE!
Of course, I do not watch my caloric intake.
Life with any type of Dementia is challenging and requires flexibility, determination, and a sense of humor!

My Wife has a very strong family tie to Alzheimer's and was exposed, second hand, to the same chemicals that caused my Lewy Body Dementia.
Recently she has exhibited many symptoms of Alzheimer's Disease and she is now waiting for an appointment with the Neurologist I see here in Pensacola.
This is a time I remember very well!
The period of time when you first KNOW you have some sort of Cognitive issues but still do not have a diagnosis.
You are very tense and hyper attentive to everything different that you experience.
You are worried and apprehensive as to what you have, if anything!
I can only be supportive at this time.
My knowledge about different dementias is worthless.
All that matters to my Wife, the patient, is what the Neurologist tells her, as it should be.
So, we wait and pray.

Well, we had our discussion with the account executive at ACTS Corporate yesterday.
It was very pleasant, and very productive.
I must state for the record that Robert is a professional that has the residents well being foremost in his mind and business practices.
Even though ACTS is not computerized and does everything through the US Mail, he actually uses the computer and we have all but solved the issues that the account person here at Azalea Trace fumbled with for now seven months.
I believe by November, Robert will have not only our account rectified but a process in place to deal with other that have Ling Term Care Insurance!!
While this has extremely upset my wife and me, I believe positive things will come from the experience.
I actually slept last night and so did my wife.

<doc date=Wednesday, October 10, 2018>
As most of you know, we live at Azalea Trace, an ACTS Retirement Community in Pensacola Florida.
It is a nice community that is operated like an 1950 community.
There is nothing computerized at Azalea or in all of the ACTS organization.
Let me repeat that.
NOTHING IS COMPUTERIZED!!!
Since I moved into Assisted Living our billing has been a total mess.
Every month, for SIX MONTHS, I have walked into the Administrative Offices and asked about our billing issues.
Each time, I was told to wait, they were working on it.
Each month we paid my Assisted Living fee in full.
WE were not billed for my Wife's independent living apartment.
for six of those months.
Last month, we received a bill for $21000!
Our records show we owed around $12000.
We had a discussion  with the ACTS Corporate Financial Office and they had no records of any of the payments we have made!
Let me interject that we came into Azalea Trace on a contract that permits us to use our Long Term Care Insurance to pay the first three years of Assisted Living or Skilled Care.
Then, we revert to only paying the second person fee, which is $1250 a month right now.
However, even though ACTS Retirement offers this formal, legal, contract, they have NO WAY TO ADMINISTER IT!!!
So, the hassle, frustration, anger, and confusion of the last six or seven months have completely ruined our experience here at Azalea Trace!
We have another scheduled telephone conference with ACTS Corporate tomorrow.
If that conference does not solve this issue, completely... Well, we may have to look at legal options.
All of this frustration has caused issues between my Wife and I as if she needed any other problems with me to deal with.
This will end tomorrow!

I had just went to bed, and I was having dizziness because of my Orthostatic Hypotension.
In other words, when I laid down, my Blood Pressures dropped and I got dizzy.
Then I started thinking of my day and how I have to "ACT" like I am normal whenever I am with anyone!
Then the correlation came to me;    Do you remember when you were 18 or 20 years old and your stomach was flat?
Well, what if you had to hold your stomach IN ALL DAY, when ever you were with anyone!!
Even your Wife, Husband, Children, Friends, and strangers!!
Sounds difficult and impossible, bedsides stupid!
But that is how I live my life, only not holding my stomach in but acting like there is nothing wrong with me!!
Why do I have to do this?
I am not really sure.
Maybe because I perceive others expect this of me.
Or, it could be my own vanity or an internal survival reflex.
Whatever the reason, it is exactly how I go through my day, everyday.
I never tell anyone I am having issues, except my Wife and then only in passing.
Instead, I hide behind a facade of smiles, jokes, and pleasantries.
It is exhausting, frustrating, and overwhelming for me.
SO, tomorrow, I want all of you to hold your stomach IN, all day!!!
Try it, you will understand where me and other Dementia patients are.

I spent 20 years in Uniform in the Navy, as a Gunner's Mate trtireing as an E-9.
Then, I went to work for the Navy as a Civil Servant (GS) working for the Navy on weapons systems and also in management.
I did some very dangerous things, some really crazy things, and put my life on the line more than once.
Never ONCE was I frightened or afraid.
I trusted my training and my ability.
I knew the systems I worked on and I was trained by some of the BEST Gunner's Mates the Navy every had.
Lewy Body Dementia has changed ALL of that!!
I used to work with a Pastor who often said;  "I am scared not and I am not afraid of anything!"  Well, that is where I am now.
My experience with LBD has taken a BIG turn for the worse and it has me finally understanding the fight I am in for.
The forest few rounds, maybe the first half of the fight, I though I was doing good, maybe even winning a little,  The last few his I have taken have convinced me I am NOT getting out of this fight alive or even easy!
My Wife and I just discussed this over the phone and she believes, and I agree, that the recent increase in LBD issues has brought me back to the grief and denial phase.
I have written about me denying, in my mind, that I am as bad off as I know I am.
I often look at new trucks to buy online, new homes to buy, and other things I used to be able to do.
That clearly is part of denial.
But I now realize I am grieving over the fact that I will never be we'll again and all I have to look forward too is more and worse LBD issues.
I am overwhelmed with grief, anger, and emotions that I cannot control.
I remember taking my Nephew Alex on the Aircraft Carrier USS Lincoln.
As we walked out on the Flight Deck, that 10 year old boy's eyes looked like saucers!
He said; "I never thought it would be THIS big!"  Well, I never knew LBD could be this frightening, difficult, and overwhelming..
I am truthfully defeated.

The other day, we were getting ready to take our walk.
We close the bedroom door when we leave my Wife's apartment to keep Zeus in the Living room.
We were both in the bedroom and I was looking for Zeus so we could close the door.
I was calling for him, and looking all around the room and my Wife said; "Look in your arms!"
I was holding Zeus in my left arm!!
Truly, I did not know.
You have to laugh! 
</doc>
<doc date=Saturday, September 8, 2018>
This afternoon I took Zeus, the Wonder Dog, out for a walk.
I was enjoying the scenery as we crossed the road around Azalea Trace headed for the dog park.
We were in no particular hurry.
And the, for no reason at all, I looked to my left and there was a Ford Pick Up truck patiently waiting for us to cross the road.
I never saw that vehicle!!
The driver was polite and curious.
Never bearing the horn, just watching a man and his dog, that was oblivious to his surroundings!!
Many times I think;  I am going to get my driver's license back!!
Sure I am, I can't even walk safely!!
Oh well, lesson learned.

<doc date=Sunday, August 26, 2018>
I spend much time thinking about moving back to Virginia, getting an apartment in an over 62 community I love.
Or, I think about leaving where I am and buying a home in Alabama, Mississippi, Sooth Dakota, or here in Florida.
Some of the house thoughts go back to my dream of building a cement home, surrounded by 10 foot high fence.
I have searched properties and houses in all the mentioned States.
Researched home builders and their plans.
Looked at listings of survival homes, researched alternate energy sources, and designed a 1969 Chevy Pickup Truck with a new crate motor and transmission from Chevy Performance parts online!!
During these marathons I am so happy, so relaxed, so content.
Then, reality sets in!!
You see, there is a surviving part of my brain that knows none of this is possible, probable, or even worth dreaming about.
Then, I am crushed and I realize I am trapped, where I am, and all I have to look forward too is a worsening of this disease.
There is no tomorrow.
No hope of things getting better.
No future.
Just this war in my mind that I know I am losing.
I want to have my life like it once was, mistakes and all.
But I am just cognitive enough to realize I can't and also just cognitive enough to know I am not cognitive anymore,

I have my own issues.
Noise agitates me, I like order and peace.
I suffer from Sundowning.
And other issues I can't remember now.
But as I look at my fellow residents, they all have similar issues and some not to similar.
For instance, one person cannot figure out what utensils to use for eating.
This person uses their coffee cup to cut food, or uses the knife to eat soup.
It is not this persons\'s fault.
It is the disease.
This person constantly places the full coffee cup in the mashed potatoes.
Other individuals have problems reading the menu, or determining what for they like to eat.
It is NORMAL for their condition.
They are not acting that way to be annoying to others!
However, I reacted in my own Dementia fog and got agitated over a person's Dementia and Hearing issues.
For that, I am sorry and ashamed.
Dementia is difficult to live with.
Dementia patients living together multiply that issue exponentially!

<doc date=Saturday, August 18, 2018>
I live in Assisted Living with are other Dementia patients.
That presents a challenge because each of us have our own issues.
Yesterday evening, just before the evening meal, a lady that has dome sort of Dementia had an anger attack because the mailman places something  in her mail box that she did not think should be there!
She was screaming in her screeching voice for at least 30 minutes!
Now, her normal voice is like fingernails on a chalk board!
When she screams, her voice could be used as torture in a POW camp!!
I could feel my own anger growing, like the feeling you get when you have stomach flu!!
I was getting ready to EXPLODE!
And I still knew I should not do that.
I had just sat down for dinner and just before I ordered, I got up and left!!
I went to my Wife's apartment and explained the situation.
She helped to calm me down.
We did our evening walk and I went back to my Cabin at 7PM.
I snacked on popcorn and cookies and went to bed.
The nurse on duty did an extremely POOR job managing the screaming Lady.
Instead of leaving this screaming meme out in the open to interrupt everyone's dinner, she should have isolated her until she could calm down.
Later, I saw the Charge Nurse and told her of my issues.
She agreed and said she would address the other nurses failures.
But the real issues is, each of us have difficulties caused by Dementia.
And the staff MUST be trained to mitigate a Dementia patients's issues to insure each resident of Assisted Living is as comfortable as possible.
Living in a communal situation with any group of people is difficult.
Adding Dementia make it even more challenging!!
Last night was a great example of that fact.

Yesterday, I received a telephone call from a First Cousin that I had not talked to in over 30 years.
It brought back some difficult memories of my past and how I came to be.
This Cousin did not know the truth of who raised me or the fact the my Mother had a total four illegitimate children.
This Cousin's Mother did not want to have contact with me because I was illegitimate!
The Cousin told me my Mother was the Black Sheep of the Family.
No kidding!
While the call was very pleasant and I enjoyed it, these were issues I had to deal with my entire life.
My dream was always to belong to a family I was related too.
Not that the wonderful people that raised me did bad.
Truthfully, they were wonderful, treated me like I was their natural son, and saw that I was raised with wonderful morales and goals.
I succeeded in life because of their sacrifices for me and I am forever grateful.
But, I was the only person I knew with my last name.
And I lived with the lies my Birth Mother told me.
I was 31 when I was finally told the truth!!
All of that has always weighed heavy on me, even now.
But now, I want to establish a relationship with those surviving Cousins I have.
I want to learn about that family I was astranged from.
It is time for me to heal.

A couple of days ago, we went to Walmart.
No big deal, RIGHT?
WRONG!
It was raining and we were walking into the side door of Walmart.
There were two Walmart employees standing on either side of this single door, on their cell phones, SMOKING, right next to the sign that had written on it in TWO INCH LETTERS, "No Smoking Within 25 feet of this sign"!!
I exploded!!
My wife did not see this nuclear explosion coming and I flame sprayed these two ignorant, self  serving morons!!
She quickly moved me into the store and gave me a basket to push.
She then asked me what that was  all about.
I explained they were smoking next to the door, where it was clearly posted as No Smoking!
She told me they were not smoking.
I argued that they were!!
I saw smoke!
She asked me; "Did you smell any smoke?"  I had to reply no....  Maybe I had another hallucination.
I had an acquaintance in a near by city that has LBD also.
I asked him once; "Do you have hallucinations?"  He replied; "My wife says I do!"  I guess that applies to me also.
It is becoming more a more apparent that the Neurologist is right,  It is not a good idea to take me out in public.

This week was crazy!
First, my Wife was summoned for Jury Duty.
Since we had doctor's appointments this week, this threw everything in a turmoil!
She was slated for a three week trial!
They chose 50 potential jurors for the jury of eight.
The second day, the questioning began and lasted from 8AM to 6 PM.
She was not selected, but I was very agitated because my Wife was gone and my routine was shattered.
Wednesday, my Wife had a doctor appointment and Thursday I saw my Neurologist.
So, we have been on the RUN all week!
My routine is just now getting back to normal.
Routines are so important to my stability.
We discussed this with the Neurologist and she agreed.
She actually told us we should avoid taking me away from the Azalea Trace area unless it was for a short time and well planned.
We both agreed.
She also discussed my recent issues and we all agreed I was still managing them fairly well.
Did I mention my Neurologist is VERY pregnant!!
By the next visit, the will be a new Mom!!
Her first.
We get a new bed for my Wife's apartment tomorrow, so it will be another disrupted day.
I will cope.
I always do.
But, most won't know just how hard these disrupted day are on me and for me!
Sometime, I think they really don't care.

It has been a while since I posted.
Anger, aggression, depression, and anxiety, have been my constant companions and I have had to find new ways to deal with these issues.
They are not show stoppers but learning experiences for those of us with LBD.
Instead of being negative about these issues, I am finding positive ways t deal with them.
I have done a considerable amount of Internet research from reputable sources like the National Institute or Health, LBDA.Org, Alz.Ord, and other sources like Mayo and some of the other Countries Dementia sources.
All of these organizations express the same ideas about dealing with these issues and I have adopted many of them with recent success.
Yes, I am feeling better!
What did I change?
First of all, I am staying away from loud noises, crowds, angry people, and unfamiliar settings.
I spend more time in "The Cabin".
Some of this tie is along, some is with Zeus, and some with my Wife.
She and I eat meals in the Assisted Living dinning room that is much quieter and smaller.
Sometimes we eat in Her apartment.
When we go out to shop, it is short, one stop events during the more quiet times for shopping.
I am also sticking close to my normal routine.
Routines are my friend and I am most comfortable when I am in my routine.
I limit conversations to people I know, like, and consider non-threatening!
That means people that don't call me a "Liar" when I say I have LBD!
Even Zeus is being more quiet and reserved.
Yesterday, he took a nap with me in "The Cabin".
He has never settled down when both of us were not in "The Cabin".
But yesterday he wanted to take a nap.
Another interesting Zeus issue.
He has LEAD me to "The Cabin" at least three times and wanted to go in to my room.
He know that is my quiet place and when we walk, he seems to sense I need quiet and away he goes!!
Those of us with LBD and other Dementia's can be independent.
Yes, we no longer drive, run the budget, or do many of the things we once did,  But we can control our environment to help us cope with LBD issues and that is TRUE Independence!

Agitation and anger have me feeling miserable.
The day started out OK.  Breakfast, some time with my Wife, an appointment with my Psychologist, and two shopping stops, both productive and not stressful.
We ate a light lunch and I tried to nap with my Wife in her apartment.
She sleep well.
My agitation started then.
Why?
Phone calls with no purpose that interrupted our nap, and a feeling of anger that was bubbling up in the pit of my stomach.
We went to my dinning room and had dinner.
A nice meal, but due to a planned power outage this morning, the ice cream was soft.
That does not bother me, but it bothers my Wife and that bothers me.
We then went back to her apartment, watched Jeopardy and Wheel of Fortune, through the constant whining for attention from our 3 year old Chihuahua.
By 7 PM, I was ready to explode!
Now, I am back in the Cabin, pissed off, and feeling miserable.
This is a normal occurrence!
A cycle that repeats itself daily.
Why?
Maybe because I reall do not like being out of my comfort zone and that is made up of where I live.
Riding in a car is almost more than I can handle.
Things are too close and too fast for me to deal with.
Parking lots are danger zones for me.
Or, at least that is how I perceive them.
Another issues is the stress of normal, daily, life.
My Wife has had some medical tests and we are waiting the results.
It could be nothing, something minor, or something major.
That has me worried and up in the air.
She has always been the healthy one!
I just can't see clean air anywhere!
Just clouds, storms, and danger.
All of this weighs very heavy on me and makes me feel miserable.
Yes, I am whining.
I have a right too!

Last Saturday Linda and I set out on a quickly planned trip to Virginia Beach.
I was NOT at all sure I could make the trip and you may recall I canceled last year's attempt at the same trip.
But, Saturday morning, with Linda the sole driver, Shem Zeus the Wonder Dog and I embarked on a reunion trip that I badly needed and wanted.
However, I was not totally sure I could make the entire trip until we left Savannah on the second day of driving.
How did I do?
Well, I had a great hallucination in a traffic jam on I-95 just into Virginia.
We were dead stopped and I saw a brand new Camaro driving UP the on ramp.
It was as real as the cars around us.
There was a van coming down the on ramp into the stopped traffic and then as the van would have hit the Camaro, it disappeared!
I also had some serious anger out bursts.
The worst, that almost cost us a new passenger window happened in a gas a station as we came back into Florida.
We were maneuvering into a gas line that would matched the location of our gas filler and a woman in a Cadillac pulled in to the space we were trying to get into.
I POUNDED on the window and almost shattered it!
Linda sped out of the Gas Station because I was going to get out of the car and physically punish the driver of that Cadillac!
But, it was great to be with friends.
Al and Annette hosted us and treated us like family!
We spend time with our best friends, Jerry and Marcia and their adult children in a great period of reunion.
Al and Annette hosted a cook out for some of the folks I worked with!
That was special too.
So, the fellowship was well worth the aggravation.
I have had a "Pipe Dream" of moving back to Virginia since we moved too Pensacola.
I am emotionally empty without my Navy friends, especially Jerry and Marcia.
We looked at an over 62 apartment complex that we were familiar with.
It is beautiful and affordable, but not practical for me, now.
There are other possibilities but I realized Azalea Trace is where I will be for the rest of my life.
It is not a bad place, it s just not where I need to be emotionally.
Once I accepted that, I knew we needed to get on the road back to Florida.
I was emotionally spent, physically tired, and mentally defeated.
We are in the best place for us.
No argument.
I was the one who pushed to move here because I knew it was the best place for both of us.
I just need to make the final adjustment to my thought process and I am working on that now.
One wonderful surprise.
LInda's birthday occurred while we were in Virginia and our SOn, James, flew in to take us out to lunch on Lnda's birthday!
What a sweet, wonderful, loving gesture on his part!!
We got home today around noon and have made an attempt to unpack and recharge.
Believe both will take the rest of the weekend.
I am in the "Cabin" in the quiet of the evening, collecting my thoughts.
I am going to take a shower and sleep until I cannot sleep any more.

I have lost many friends and shipmates in the wars and police actions of the last 40 years or so.
Saying "Happy Memorial day" is blasphemy to me.
One of my forgotten Shipmates, GMG1 Robert "Red" Mills was killed on the USS Benjamin Stoddard, off the coast of Northern Vietnam in 1972 while the ship was in a gun battle with a NVA shore battery.
The President, a lying bastard named Johnson, who trumped up a lie called the Tonkin Gulf Resolution, sent ships north of the DMV to engage the NVA.
In any case, Red had a foul bore and HOT GUN, and in trying to get the MK 42 5"/54 Rapid Fire gun mount back in action, it exploded, killing him and three others.
He has been on my mind for quite a while and I decided to call his widow.
She remembered me!
We talked last night and had a great reunion.
She made the best of his death by going to college and becoming a teacher.
She taught for 30 years and then retired!!
It did me good to talk to her and it did her good to be remembered.
Red never got any heroism awards.
His name is on the Vietnam Memorial and his widow and sons were provided for, as they should have been.
But Memorial Day is much more than picnics, and a day off to me.
It is a day to remember those who gave the ULTIMATE SACRIFICE for our freedom!
</doc>
<doc date=Saturday, May 26, 2018>
Nobody who ever knew me would describe me as easy going, calm, or unemotional.
However, I could keep my cool If the situation demanded it.
After I retired from the Navy totally, I did calm down somewhat.
I have had some very emotional, violent, episodes that I am not proud of..
But, I have tried very hard, to control my temper because I knew it would get worse as the LBD progressed.
Well, the LBD has progressed and my anger, agitation, and explosive episodes have EXPLODED!!
Yesterday, the FEDEX delivery driver came speeding past the dog park doing at least 50 mph!
The campus speed limit is poster everywhere, at 15 mph,  He had just gone over a speed bump at 50 MPH!!!
I had seen his individual before and at that time, I could not chase him because I had the dog with me.
But this time, I was alone, doing some maintenance in the dog park!!!
I beat feet, cane and all, to the administration building where I knew he was going.
The landscaping person bear me ther in his small cart.
He had just nicely told the individual the speed limit was 15 and he was speeding.
Then, Lee, the landscaping person, tole toeh second in command here, who was outside of the admin building about the incident.
When I came on the scene, the FEDEX driver was getting mouthy with Lee and the manager!
I exploded!!
I told the FEDEX driver his day was about to get really bad.
Then the DIrector of Azalea Trace came on the scene and she took over.
Well, she took control of me and calmly walked me into the admin building.
She told me she would take care of the situation and I should go to my Cabin and relax.
I knew she was right and she handled me so respectfully and gently I wanted to do what she wanted.
But, I really wanted to kick that moron's ass too.
But, I was a good boy.
These event happen more and more and I now feel I need to isolate myself from most group events.
Recently I also.
Got agitated at a Town Hall meeting here.
Not a good thing.
Some of my agitation and anger is coming from the people at the Federal Long Term Insurance office that are handling my claim.
The have not paid us yet and now owe us two months,  We have had to pay Azalea Trace out of our pocket.
That cannot go on much longer.
Every time our bill gets submitted they find fault with it.
Either they are morons or Azalea Trace cannot submit a simple billing to and insurance company.
Either way, I am pissed about this issue 24/7!!
There there is the increase in hallucinations.
I saw a new Chrysler/Fiat Jeep Grand Cherokee in our drop off area when I was coming back from the dog park with Zeus yesterday.
It was a bright, clear day.
I clearly saw the Jeep, it was white, shiny , and I recognized it as one of the new residents.
But, even though I was only 50 feet from where I saw the Jeep, before we got to the Jeep it disappeared!
It did not drive off, or park in a space.
It just wasn't there anymore!
This stuff is wearing on me!
!

Let me be truthful.
I am a lot farther into LBD than most people understand.
My wife let on in her recent post that she has seen this.
She also told me today.
I was a fearless Navy Master Chief Gunner's Mate.
Or, at least I could control and hide my fears.
That is what bravery really is;  being able to control your fears and do what is expected of you, regardless of those inner fears.
Well, now, I cannot control my fears.
For instance, travel.
Two years ago we took a trip to the ARK in Kentucky, then to Cleveland to see my family, and then to Iowa to see Linda's family.
All went well except our credit card got "HACKED"!!
No issue, Navy Federal handled it brilliantly.
The trip went off without an issue.
Last year we planned a trip to Virginian Beach.
I backed out!
This year, my wife is trying to get me back to Virginia Beach one more time, to see very good friends.
It will be good for me.
But, I am overwhelmed with fears that I cannot control.
First and foremost, I no longer am licensed to drive and I am a terrible passenger!
Things seem much closer to me than they actually ware and I am continually telling my wife to stop, watch out!
Or I am ducking because I am sure we are going to be hit!
And that is just on a trip to the store at the corner!
Then there is Zeus!
He does not ride well, so far.
Maybe he will settle down on the road.
Then there is the credit care issues of getting "Hacked".
Then there is money issues.
Our Federal Long Term Insurance is being difficult so far.
Then there is where to stay with a dog, or not and the cost, and eating, and who the see, and the stress of being out of my environment.
I am overwhelmed and frightened.
LBD has made me a prisoner in my own body!
And I do not know how to deal with this issue, or even "IF" I can deal with this issue.
I never thought I would be so crippled with fear.
I remember how disoriented and frightened my Father in Law go when we took him out for a meal from his Nursing Home.
He had Alzheimer's before all the new drugs and understanding.
I am now my Father in Law.
Disoriented, lost in my own mind, fearful, paralyzed by fright, and unable to make a decision!

Several viewers of Don's blog have requested that I describe my take on Don's move to Assisted Living.
I have been mulling around in my head trying to form a response that is truthful and neither sugarcoats, downplays or is overly critical of the situation.
Don thought about assisted living a lot before he made his choice to actually move.
We would talk about it listing pros and cons and each time I felt we both were on the same track of remaining in our one-bedroom apartment at Azalea continuing to cope with changes as they occurred.
It was frustrating for me because I felt strongly that Don & I were safe and togetherand that was all that mattered.
My preference is Don and I together, braving whatever comes together.
I remember the times when Don was on sea duty, with 6 to 8 months cruises; in one week, out the next; duty days; broken gun mounts that required 24-hour days to fix.
We always found time to be together whenever he was in port.
Sometimes he would call at 2:00am and I would grab up our son, get in the car, pick Don up and have him back at the ship at 5:30am.
It was our togetherness, our connection to each other.
We were at the center and everything else came second.
That is how I felt and still feel about us.
I want us together in the same apt.
us against the world.
But... that is not what is good for Don.
So now.
At first, I felt abandoned.
It wasn't our togetherness he needed but solitude.
How could that be?
Lewy Body Dementia is a hard taskmaster.
It demands more and more of Don (and each person who suffers from it) until it fully consumes.
What Don was telling me and I wasn't hearing is that he needed a quiet cocooning space to not only reenergize but to hang on to his inner self.
From what I can comprehend with Lewy Body life is different in ways that we who don't have it can barely understand.
A simple everyday phone call is a jarring strident noise that disrupts the psyche and sets him on edge.
Add to that the tv, the commercials that come on in loud decibels, the dog whining, my voice droning on about things that overwhelm him, residents going down the hallway conversing loudly.
Cacophony, chaos, winding him up like a tight spring - with no way to vent before an overwhelming explosion occurs.
Life with Lewy Body is a quiet hell of inner turmoil... how could I continue to hang on to "you need to be with me" when Don needed a quiet, safe place to detox in solitude, to renew, refresh, bring back as much harmony, serenity, and quietude as is possible.
So, I have come to terms with the change.
Because I love Don I accept and feel grateful that there is a place Don has that is his lifeline.
Because Don loves me he is willing to leave his place of peacefulness to brave the turmoil of everyday life to be with me.
We have created our togetherness, different from the Navy times, but still our togetherness that is the center of us.
We are and will always be tuff together!!
There is still rough road ahead.
Lewy Body is like the flowing lava we see as Kilauea erupts and consumes everything in its path.
I believe Don's hanging on to his inner self will be harder and harder to do.
There is the possibility Don won't always recognize me.
There will be fear, anger, loneliness, sadness, how will we cope with all that possible horror?
I have to trust that God knows best and will cocoon Don with His presence and trust that God in His mercy will help me through the future horrors.
For now...   I cherish this time together.

The other night, I was asleep in the Cabin.I was awakened by the sound of heavy rain on my window and on the roof.
After a few minutes I decided to get up and look out my window into the parking lot and check on the rain.
I was not forecast to rain but here in East Lower Alabama, the weather guesses is seldom right.
In anywise, it was pouring out!!
No thunder or lightening, just a frog strangler rain.
I went back to bed after watching the rain for a few minutes.
The next morning, I looked out of my window after opening the blinds and the ground was bone dry!
The path over to my Wife's apartment was bone dry!
Obviously it did not ran the night before.
O well I enjoyed a rain store in my mind.

Today, at Noon (CST) I turned my Driver's License in and became a documented non-driver.
I have been driving since I was 13 and license to drive since I was 16.
That is 50+ years of driving!
My Florida Driver's license had "Safe Driver" on the bottom!
I am depressed  and upset over this, but I do realize it is the right thing to do for many reasons.
But, it is just another part of me that exists no longer.
I have listed many of these things before.
And YES, most LBD and other Dementia patients have to deal with this issue.
That is why I am addressing it.
It will most likely impact each of us the same way.
I feel personally diminished!
Less of a man!
More unable to do for myself.
Sound familiar?
But continuing to drive would put my wife and me is extreme legal jeopardy!
Do you realize that is you have a Dementia diagnosis and the Doctor has advised or directed you NOT TO DRIVE, and you continue to drive and have an accident, your Insurance is invalid!?!
They do not have to cover the damages because you did not follow the doctor's directions.
Yes, you can get a lawyer and say the doctor did not notify DMV to have your license revoked, but you are the one responsible form your actions!
I did not like doing what I did.
But, it is the right thing to do.
Yes, I am sulking right now and I doubt I will ever be happy with this decision,  But I would have been even more unhappy if I continued to drive and caused an accident!

I get asked that all the time!
Like it is anyone's business except Linda and me.
But, I was sitting here in the Cabin, playing computer games to relax and this post came into my mind.
I get very agitated and angry with people's attitude towards me.
Azalea Trace is full of "Landed Gentry" people that are convinced their solid waste does not have an odor!
Here in Assisted Living, there are many folks that are nice and some that look at me like I have dog poop all over my body.
These snooty folks have gone to the nurses and asked "Why is HE here?"  Some have even asked me and then when I explain why to them they tell me I am wrong and there is nothing wrong with me!!
Yes, one of these days, someone is going to get a knuckle sandwich..
I can see it coming.
But, I am here because three medical professionals, the LIng Term Insurance inspector Nurse, my wife, and myself, know this is the best place for me.
The question you may ask is why.
For instance today, my wife was out of the apartment and I was at my Memory Support Group.
A group Linda and I established!
When I returned to the apartment where my wife now lives, she was gone and I did not know where she was!
I was upset and agitated over this.
When she returned she told me she had told me this morning and last night she was going to help with the day BSF class!
I remembered that when she reminded me, but that did not help before she came back.
Leaving me alone is not a good idea.
I get upset and worried.
Also, some things in my life continue to change because of LBD.
For instance, I do not drive.
As a matter of fact, I have an appointment to turn my driver's license into Florida DMV on Monday!
I am not happy about this, but I have not driven in a long time.
So, it makes sense when my brain is functioning near normal.
I also cannot have normal bowel movement anymore because of Autonomic Dysfunction.
And I am unable to perform sexually for the same reason.
Oh, and my BP and body temperature fluctuate wildly during the day!
And I get dizzy when I stand up or lay down.
And I have difficulty walking when I first get out of a seated position.
Not to mention loud noises, tension, and other normal things make me terrible agitated, angry, and almost violent.
Then there is the issues with my vision.
I hallucinate, have distance vision issues, and when I ride in a scar, I want to verbally attack everyone around us!!
I no longer watch any news programs, dramas, military shows, or movies because they agitate me.
I cannot go to a movie theater because they have surround sound and it is pitch black in there.
Those two things turn me I to a raging basket case!
Yep, I am normal and need to be living in my own home away from any care!!
One point, my GP, Neurologist, and Psychologist all have told Linda and I that I am very brave in the manner I am handling the progression of my LBD.
That helps me know we did the right thing.
But, as Jackie Gleason often said; " One of these days, ONE OF THESE DAYS,  POW!!!
Right in the kisser!

I have had all sorts of hallucinations since I was first diagnosed.
Sight, touch, sound, and smell Hallucinations have been my constant companions.
Yes, they increase and subside in intensity and frequency.
But they have never gone away.
Sometimes I have one one type or maybe two types occurring and then they subside and others take their place.
Recently, touch hallucinations have taken the forefront.
For the last week, I have been woke up numerous times by the feeling of something or someone walking on my pillow!
Since Zeus the Wonder Dog does not spend nights with me in the Cabin, it can't be him, but he is what I reach out for when I feel my pillow depressing next to my head.
It is somewhat unnerving to say the least.
To be startled out of a sound sleep by the feeling of your pillow being depressed as if someone or something is walking on it!!
In the past, hallucinations have seldom frightened me or put me on edge.
These have.
Must be a new phase of LBD development.
Joy!

My Wife and I had today all planned out.
First, my Psychologist visit, then go to the next county and turn in my Driver's License, then lunch, a haircut, and a visit to our GRandon to get some Skype training.
It did not work out that way.
We arrived at the Psychologist's office with 20 minutes to spare.
But, they messed up and did not have the appointment scheduled for me, even though my Wife had the appointment card!
OK, I was angry, but I kept it in.
Then to the Tax Collecter's Office in the next county.
The informed us since I did not live in Santa Rosa County, I could not turn in my Driver's Liscense to them!
OK, I lost it!
This is the state of Florida!!
Not the state of Escambia County or Santa Rosa County!!
What a stupid way to run a state wide system.
I was screaming at my Wife to get me out of Florida!!!
This state is run by uneducated Hicks missing their front teeth!
So, now I am agitated, angry, cussing, and my Wife is trying to deal with all of this.
I am screaming at cars around us!
But, we call the only Men's barber shop in the five county area that makes up the panhandle of Florida to see if one of the only TWO barbers that are skilled at cutting regular Men's hair are available to cut many hair.
I was in luck, if we got there in 20 minutes, before the only barber working today went to his three hour lunch, I could get a haircut!
We were successful and I got a good haircut.
Then, we went to a nice lunch since we were too late to make lunch here at Azalea.
After lunch, I was spent and so was Linda, so we came home.
One home, we tried to make sense of the day, and then the people installing the retrofitted fire sprinkler system came to our apartment!
After they, I went back to Assisted Living to decompress.
But, the Azalea Bill was there!!
It was a shock!
And It was all I could do to keep my cool.
Not that I was surprised.
I expected it to be large, since we had to pay for my Assisted Living room above our normal rent until the long term insurance kicked in.
But, the LTC folks had not yet informed us if they approved my request to use the insurance we had paid on for 10 plus years.
So, I went back to my Wife's apartment and shocked her with the bill!
She then called the LTC folks and found out all was approved!
Praise God!!
So, the day turned out OK.
I am relaxing in the Cabin, my Wife is working on Poems or BSF.
And I may be able to sleep tonight.
I HAVE HAD A ROUGH DAY.
And so has Linda!
I am so sorry my Love.
Thanks for being so understanding.

Today brought some of my major LBD issues to the forefront.
They are beginning the installation of retrofitted sprinklers in our apartment.
The one my wife lives in now.
I wanted to be there for the first briefing of what was to be done, but Ialso had my Dementia Support Group at 10AM..
The meeting was scheduled for 9AM.
I was there at 8:15 AM!
The construction noise in apartments around us began at 8AM!
By 9:15, no one had came for the scheduled appointment!!
I was ready to explode!!
My wife, calmly suggested I go get ready for my 10AM meeting.
I left, but I was agitated all morning!
Today, we also finally took me off the auto insurance.
Yes, I was told not to drive by my Neurologist a while ago, and I don't.
But, I still have my driver's license.
We made the decision to turn my DL in.
Wow, is that a psychological punch in the gut!
Both of these issues along with some things that came up at group today really focused me on where I REALLY am.
I put on a pretty good show in public most of the time.
But, I am really not that well!
And today, I admitted it public and  and to myself.
Both difficult things to do.
I am not the self-reliant, tough guy, I used to be.
I am s shell of my former self, and I do not like myself this way.
Difficult day!

Many people, including residents of Independent Living here at Azalea Trace have asked me, sincerely;  Am I happy in Assisted Living?
My resounding answer is; YES!!
Why?
Well, the rooms are large, comfortable, clean, modern, quiet, well lite, have large windows, and exceed my needs, wants, and desires.
Then there is the staff.
They also exceed my needs, wants and desires!!
The people that work here have our happiness and health on their mind 24/7/365!!
The are friendly, helpful, and ready to help in ANY way!
Yes, there is at least one person in Willow Brook Court, what Azalea Trace calls Assisted Living, that is not happy.
That individual would not be happy in Buckingham Palace with an unlimited staff at their becking call and an unlimited budget!!
There are some folks that just refuse to be happy no matter what you do!
I feel at home here.
I feel welcomed by the entire staff here.
And I know I am cared for here.
I can ask for nothing else!
Thanks to ACTS and Azalea Trace for my wonderful care.
I am truly blessed!

The last week in the Cabin has been good.
I am more relaxed, less agitation, and I have only had one or two anger outbursts.
I spend each night, from about 7 pm until 8 am in the Cabin and the surrounding community.
I also eat most of my meals here.
Sometimes, my Wife eats lunch or dinner with me.
Last night, Linda wanted me to spend the night with her in our apartment.
I did and I noticed more agitation and more irregular heart beating when I went to bed.
Of course, there is much more noise and commotion in Independent Living, at least in the corridor we live on.
And, Linda kept her normal nightly routines of working on projects when I am needing to go to bed.
That is not her fault.
I need to go to bed earlier than her or most folks!
I still am convinced we made the right decision for the right reasons.
We have not yet heard from the long term insurance folks.
I expect that reply this week.
On another note;  I have had a continuing problem with constipation.
I have been taking Myrilax.
It did work, but much slower than advertised.
My Neurologist recommended it, so I feel safe using it.
But, these issues need to be tracked in Dementia patients!!
Becoming uremic or septic is a big issue for us with Dementia.
More later.

<doc date=Tuesday, March 20, 2018>
It will not be a week until Thursday, but I can tell you the Cabin is relaxing, calming, and therapeutic for me.
In can come here and have complete silence, with no activity around me.
No one going down the hallway laughing, talking, or squeezing!
(Yes, power chairs and trash bins squeak!).
Just quiet.
I sleep better, feel more rested in the morning, and have more energy.
The staff here at Azalea Trace, Oak Bridge Terrace are sincerely caring.
I could not ask for more.
It took me a couple of days to get oriented, and there are a few details to work out, but this is good for me and, I hope it is good for my wife.
The dog is adjusting well to commuting.
All in all, I believe this is the best thing for me!

Let me give you an idea of how LARGE my "Cabin" room is.
I rode Destroyers in my Navy career.
The largest ship I served on were DD 963 class ships.
My "Cabin" would have berthed 15 sailors sleeping three high in five three bunk sets.
And all the locker space required, and a Head big enough to serve those 15 sailors!
And I have all that space to myself!!
I can't understand why some folks complain.
They must be spoiled brats.

<doc date=Thursday, March 15, 2018>
I was notified my room in Assisted Living was ready last Tuesday!!
I checked it out and it WAS ready!!
So, yesterday we started moving furniture that we had purchased for my room.
Some was stored in our small apartment and some stayed with the vendors until we were ready.
Now, everything is in place and I will spend my first night in AL tonight.
Zeus the Wonder Dog is not too sure of this change.
He is very upset my red recliner is missing from our apartment.
He found it today in my AL room.
He was elated and immediately jumped into the chair!!
My TV is not set up yet, but that will come soon.
I am terribly agitated and upset over this move.
Yes, I wanted it.
It is a change and change is not good for me.
There will be a period of adjustment, I realize that and my research supports that.
But all the knowledge and planning in the world does not soften the reality of this move.
I cannot understand how bad this is for someone farther down the Dementia path than I am.
I am a mess!
It must me terrible for them.
I have not done any of the decorating yet.
Not pictures up yet.
But my clothes are there and all the furniture is there.
It looks like home, but not like mine yet.
Another point, Linda and I have decided to call this place our "Cabin"!
It softens the reality.

We have filed out claim with out Long Term Care Insurance.
We have paid on that policy for over 16 my years and not it is time for my policy to take care of me as advertised.
They require doctor's reports and a visit from their RN to see if me and the Doctor's are lieing!
I guess that makes sense.
There are people that scam the system.
The RN set up the meeting for yesterday afternoon.
She was polite, professional, and at least familiar with LBD.
But, she agitated me!
SHe had a series of stupid, meaningless, annoying things to test me including the Mini-Mental test.
Trust me, that test was made by some mini-mental moron!!
I had to go to the bathroom and while I was away, my Wife told the nurse she was agitating me!
It didn't help.
After the two and a half hour interrogation, my wife walked her out.
During that time she asked my wife if I was a danger to others!!
Good thing she did not ask me!
My reply would have been: Only people that agitate me.
Now, we wait until she submits her report and the Long Term Care company makes their decision.
This has been a difficult, frustrating, agitating, process and if it ever ends, I will be glad.

On 28 Feb, I was lead to believe the painting was complete and I was ready to move into my Assisted Living room.
Nothing could be FARTHER  FROM THE TRUTH!!
I looked at the room and they had spot painted including the BIG WATER SPOT FROM A LEAK IN THE CEILING!!!
That is like painting over rust on a Navy ship!
Now, to his credit, the Director of AL saw that and addressed the issue.
He asked the Plant Director why they would paint over an obvious leak!!
And, they then said they would address the leak and completely paint the room.
It is March 8 and NOTHING HAS BEEN DONE!!!
Look, if I did not need to move to Assisted Living I would not have asked to move to Assisted Living!!
So, why does it take two months to paint a simple 177 square foot room and find a leak in the ceiling of a one story building?!
I am considering turning off this move to AL here at Azalea Trace and finding a facility that can accommodate my needs.
I AM FED UP!!
And that emotional issue does not help me at all. 
</doc>
<doc date=Wednesday, February 28, 2018>
It appears my move to Assisted Living is very near.
They have done some touch up paint in the room.
I thought it would be totally repainted, but no...
So, they have to clean the room bathroom and then it will me mine.
I did ask for a new toilet seat!!
So, I will most likely be moving this weekend!
I have to contact the bedding store to get the bed delivered and the wood refinisher to get the headboard delivered.
The rest is on me.
I will be busy.
I am excited and frightened about this move.
It is a move into the unknown and probably the last place I will ever live.
That fact is unnerving.
I will let you know how this goes and how I deal with the emotions I am facing.
As an addendum; We had a community meeting today to discuss the numerous construction and improvement plans for Azalea Trace.
The plans include an expansion of Assisted Living and Skilled Care.
Assisted Living will include a Memory Support Facility!!
Skilled Care will be converted to private rooms!
Both of these capitol improvements will make our lives much better.
However, many residents can't see the benefit because they think only of themselves.
That attitude during the meeting agitated me greatly and my Wife had to calm me down a couple of times.
I almost got up and left, just for my own well being.
These agitation and anger issues clearly let me know my move to Assisted Living is the right thing.

<doc date=Friday, February 23, 2018>
The frustration, agitation, anger, despair, loneliness, and depression that LBD bring on is overwhelming.
Things that agitate me overwhelm my senses and I attack them because I believe they need fixed.
I have always had this sense of duty.
But, it seems to be hypersensitive now and I am unable to sort out my emotions from the facts sometimes.
I am not saying I was wrong about last nigh because I was not!!!
But, it does illustrate why I need to be in a more controlled environment.
But, my safety and emotional stability are being subverted by the lack of a painter.
Oh, there goes my frustration issues again. 
</doc>
<doc date=Friday, February 23, 2018>
Last night, at 10 PM or so, I took the dog out for his last potty stop.
We passed through the automatic door and out to the grass.
We did our business and then came back in.
But, I did not need to use my key fob to get back in.
No issue, I one how to reset the door.
Some residents stupidly bypass the security system!
Then, I thought, the door at the other end of the hall was propped open earlier so I walked down to check it.
It was still propped open permitting any poisonous snake, armadillo, bear, coyote, for, rapist, robber, or terrorist access to a supposedly secure building.
I tried to close that door but could not.
Then I saw the two "Barney Fife" security  guards and my social filters melted down!
I gave those two morons a Navy Master Chief ass chewing they will never forget!
It did no good of course.
They have to realize there is a problem before being corrected has an impact!
And trust me, the security people here at Azalea Trace would not know a security violation if it bit them in the ass!!
This recent anger outburst would not have happened if I was living in Assisted Living, but that is not going to happen anytime soon because the ONLY PAINTER is out sick!!
As we kidding me?!!
We paid $200,000 up front to move in, and $3200 a month and they have one painter?!
I am beginning to question my decision to live here.
But, I am also beginning to question why I am alone in my concerns about how this place operates.
That then makes me even more agitated and angry, causing me more problems, and making my LBD issues even worse!!!
No one cares.
No one helps.
Why should I. I have added the emails I sent last night and this morning.
At the time of this posting, I have NOT received a reply!
The door by the pool, has been OPEN ALL DAY!!
I went out to walk the dog at 1015 and the door for the Mid Rise lobby was set to let people in without a fob!!
I then checked the door by the pool and it was OPEN STILL!!
Any creature, snake, bug, robber, terrorist, can just walk in!!!
There are mosquitos in the "C" wing on the walls and the hall is warm and humid!!
Two security guards told me the computer was at fault and the people worked today on it and would return tomorrow.
That is simply unsatisfactory!!
The idea that Acts advertises stating we have a secure building is a fantasy and this proves it.
I am extremely upset over this lack of concern for the safety of the residents!
Don Dolence Donald Dolence <silverfoxcnsl@gmail.com> 7:38 AM (1 hour ago) to DAVID, TAMMY Another point;  WHY is there a television in the room security sits in?
I have seem them in there sleeping, watching the Super Bowl, World Series and other programs when they are supposed to be on watch.
If hey need to sit down,let them sit at the front desk.
I have also witnessed them on the computer in the library and asleep in a chair in the library.
These occurrences are t night and on weekends, mostly.
Also, last night, the guards were completely NOT aware that the door by the pool was OPEN!!
So, they either do not do rounds or do them with their eyes closed!
This is really an issue for me.
Security is a 24/7/365 responsibility.

It has been almost 5 weeks since we made the decision to move me to Assisted Living.
That was the day we notified management here at Azalea Trace that I needed t make the move.
My room is still not ready.
Yes, the floor, we paid for is done.
But the room is not painted and obviously is not cleaned.
The room is 177 square feet.
I could have painted it with a tooth brush by now!!!
When I said I NEEDED to move to AL, I meant; I REALLY NEEDED TO MOVE TO ASSISTED LIVING!!!!
The waiting is agitating me!!
Even my wife is ready for the move.
Five weeks, is ridicules.

Last Wednesday, I knew I was getting sick.
What it was, I was not sure.
Thursday, my Wife took both of us to the Urgent Care next to us.
The Nurse Practicioner could not find much wrong with me but she was going to do the test for the flu.
She then talked with my Wife, realized we lived at Azalea Trace, and gave us both Tamiflu.
We began taking Tamiflu immediately.
I did not even have  a fever.
That cam on later in the afternoon on Thursday, with a vengeance!
I normally run a body temp of 97 or so.
I had a fever of 102 that lasted two days.
It started to go down Saturday morning and was 97 this morning.
I also used my asthma inhaler and Mucenix D to fight the congestion and bronchial distress.
I now feel normal!!
Tamiflu works.
My Wife has not experienced any flu like symptoms after taking he course of Tamiflu.
So it it also a great preventative medicine.
We stayed in our apartment and if we were out, wore a mask to keep from infecting anyone we might come in contact with.
As far as my move goes;  The floor is done and looks great!!
We chose and paid extra for vinyl planking.
It is easy to clean, wears well, and looks like wood!
The still need to paint and clean.
When that is done is anyone's guess.
I will keep yo informed.
Thanks for you prayers.

This has been a long journey for Linda and me.
We have both been very tough throughout this journey.
But the recent increase in issues is becoming overwhelming for me.
Couple that with the stress of the move to Assisted Living and I am overwhelmed.
The expense of the move, t he fact that I do not feel good at all, and the impact of the cognitive and physical issues that have exploded over the last few months and I am spent.
Will I do better in AL?
I hope so, but I am not sure.

I had a three month check up with my Neurologist Office today.
Normally, it is 6 months, but there have been so many changes in my condition that she wanted to see me sooner.
Good visit.
She is very caring and attentive to my condition and needs.
She made two important medical statements today; First was related to me driving.
I stated during a discussion that I still had my driver's license.
She said;  "Only as a souvenir!"  She said I could Fran it if I wanted.
Believe it or not, that cracked me up.
Second;  She penned a document stating that I am medically required to live in Assisted Living due to the effects of  Lewy Body Dementia.
That was the first time it was officially stated, in legal terms and in writing that I must be in AL.
That is chilling to me.
Yes, I know that is where I need to be.
But to have a medical professional proclaim it, was sobering.
The refreshing of my room should begin tomorrow.
We will see.
More later.

<doc date=Friday, February 2, 2018>
To say this is stressful would be an great understatement.
The financial and logistic stressors have me questioning the move, my sanity, and my future.
Things we not as they were portrayed when we moved to this CCRC.
Or, at least, they are not as I perceived they were portrayed.
Then, there is the "wait" for the room to be readied.
That seems to be inordinately complicated for a 200 square foot room refresh.
Then there is the purchase of needed furniture for my room.
For instance, I never thought I would have to go to 7 furniture stores to purchase a chest of drawers that met my needs!!
All of this has been very stressful for me and has left me is a constant state of agitation.
I am sure my wife is looking forward to moving me to AL, just to get a break!!
And she deserves one.
What next?
Dealing with the Long Term Insurance forms, questions, and hopefully the approval.
This is far more stressful that it needs to be and mush more difficult than I am able to handle.

<doc date=Thursday, January 25, 2018>
I have written about my increased issues with agitation and anger.
The recent, very public angry outbursts have brought this issue to the forefront!
If you do not know me very well, let me give you some background.
I was a Master Chief Gunner' Mate in the United States Navy.
A warrior, and a person in charge of every explosive device on a Navy ship.
As I used to say, I was responsible for and work on everything from a .22 cal pistol to Nuclear Weapons.
As I promoted from E-1 to E-9,  I was mentored by men that were "Old School" Navy Chiefs.
I was taught and expected to know what I was doing, be able to technically prove I was right, and never, EVER,  back down!!
And that is exactly how I was for over 40 years.
When we discussed the move with our Son, I said I was having issues with angry Outbursts.
James said: "You have always been subject to angry outbursts!"
He is right, when something was wrong in my estimation, I let everyone know, in no uncertain terms!
The difference is, then, I controlled that anger and dispersed it based on the severity of the issue that was wrong and the audience I was addressing.
Otherwise, I used my verbose, loud, bombastic, personality, to my advantage in any situation!!
Now, I do not control that anger and I do not control the way is is used.
Little, inconsequential things cause me a big an explosion as a really important issue.
Then, there are issues I perceive  to be wrong, but are truly not!!
Te danger of this is, and the reason to move to an area where there are professionals trained to deal with my issues is, one day, my anger will elevate to violence.
It did before LBD and it will now.
This is very difficult for me to put in print, in the public domain.
But, I must be honest in all that I experience.
And while I have not felt my anger boiling to violence, I have to recognize that is may in the future.
Forewarned is forearmed.
So, I know the move to AL is good for me, my wonderful Wife, and all that live in my community.
Enough said.

My eyesight has suffered in the last year or so.
I had depth perception issues that make hallways look like tunnels and things look very close to me.
When I am riding in the car, in the from seat, I jump and yell as my wife pulls up to a stop light!
It appears to me that she is WAY too close to the car in front.
She calmly tells me; "I have this."
The other, peculiar thing is print media looks very small to me.
I have difficulty reading and on the computer, I enlarge the print.
My hand writing, which was never very good, is now small and almost unreadable by even me.
I put things on the shopping list we keep on the refrigerator and my wife has great difficulty deciphering my hen scratching.
Of course, I seldom remember what I meant when I wrote the request.
I am reticent to see an eye doctor because, here in Pensacola, the people in the Medical field can't spell Lewy Body Dementia, well enough treat it!
And, there is probably no treatment for this issue anyway.

<doc date=Saturday, January 20, 2018>
We live in a wonderful CCRC.
There are many folks here that truly need to be in Assisted Living (AL) but will not move because they have preconceived notions about AL.
So, they live in Independent Living, sometimes paying out of their pocket for Home Health Care, when the same or better services are available in AL for free because they live in a CCRC!
There are also some individuals that should be in Skilled Care but refuse to move so they pay, out of their pocket, for 24 hour care n their Independent Living apartment.
That makes no sense to me.
But people have issues about moving to a higher level of care.
What issues, I can only guess.
Most people do not educate themselves about what health conditions they have and how AL can extend their lives and extend their enjoyment of life.
Where we live, there are more electric scooters and rollators in use in Independent Living that there is in AL!!
That is curious.
I am moving because all of the studies support moving a Dementia Patient to AL or Memory care when the patient is still has enough cognitive ability to understand and participate in the move.
There is less mental and physical shock to the patient if he or she takes part in the move including room selection, furnishing and decorations.
I am actually excited about doing this.
Another issue is that caregivers need respite!
Living with a Dementia patient 24/7/365 and being the only person caring for that patient takes it's toll, FAST!!
Here at Azalea, I will be able to freely move between AL and Independent Living.
My wife can stun overnight in my room if she desires and I can spend an occasional night in our apartment with her.
She can eat in AL with me or we can eat in the Independent Living dining room.
Or we can go out and eat!!
These freedoms makes the transition easier on both of us.
When I am having a difficult time, I can stay in my AL room and have the care I need and m Wife has the freedom to rest and know I am well taken care of.
But, some people have this negative stigma about higher levels of care.
Again, I do not understand why, I just know it is there.
I hope my move will help erase some of those erroneous pre-conceived notions.

We live in a wonderful CCRC community!
The management here at Azalea Trace, an.
ACTS Retirement community, is very responsive to our needs.
We met with the Director of Assisted Living today and he was all ready to help us!
Now in truth, he sees me every week when I conduct the memory Support Group in new the Assisted Living Recreation Room.
The staff helps me, makes sure I have coffee, and treat me with loving kindness.
Also, to me totally transparent, I ran in to our Executive Director the other day and she asked me how I was doing.
I was honest with her and she said, let me know how I can help!
And today, when Linda and I me with the Director of Assisted Living, he was ready to do whatever it took to help us.
But, to the point.
We were offered a one bedroom suite so that both of us could move to Assisted Living, but that would not meet our needs.
Linda does NOT need AL.
And I need a place to cocoon, alone.
The Director explained that I could move back and forth between out apartment and my AL room, as I wanted.
And, my wife could stay in my AL room, sleep with me, and spend time there.
So, after an afternoon of discussion, we decided to take the singles room foe me and keep her in the One Bedroom apartment we now share.
The best of both worlds.
If I predecease her, no issues, she is still in our apartment customized as we wanted it and as we PAID for it!!
And, on the outside chance that I would omit live her, I would be exactly where I should be.
So, the decision is made.
We will tell the AL Director tomorrow morning.
Thanks Azalea Trace!!
You have given us  peace of mind!

See, I told you my LBD was getting worse!!
I am actually writing about how difficult my anger issues are getting.
However, people that tell me I am not sick, or a Doctor I go to Church with who says he does not see any LBD symptoms in me, need a punch in the nose!!
For instance, read the symptoms listing from Dr. Galvin or from LBDA.org and then look at me with your eyes open, and yo will not make stupid statements.
But, as I have said before, there are few if any competent Doctors in Pensacola!!
And any Doctor that made a career of the Military was NOT a good Medical Practitioner.
Trust me, I knew many doctors and dentists in the Navy and the good ones got out when their school loans were paid back.
Why, because after pay grade O-3, they are administrators and not practicing, hands on, doctors.
And the quack at Church retired from the Navy and went to work for the Veteran's Administration!!
And you probably know the VA is not a repository of medical professionals!!
So, since my agitation and anger issues have increased, the emotions that I fight when people treat me with such little respect really fire me up!
Will I punch someone in the nose for telling me I am not sick?
Not yet!!
And I hope I am in a higher level of care before I get to that point.

I have been having thoughts and dreams that start out as random and then become real, and then I become obsessed with them and have to flesh them out!!
Some times, I am able to determine the issue I am tracking down is no more than a thought or a dream that I had and it is not real.
But, that realization is coming much slower now.
I have had this issue for a while but it is becoming more intense and more real to me.
I know I am sliding down the path of LBD, faster and faster.
But things like this are beginning to frighten me.
There are a number of "What If" issues that bother me about these thoughts and dreams that become "real" to me.

<doc date=Wednesday, January 10, 2018>
I remember very vividly, when my Mom was about to die.
My Dad would say; "If she would just get up and walk around the block, she would be OK!"
Of course, the cancer and the ravages of the Chemo and Radiation therapy of the 1970's were invisible to him and us.
But Dad saw her as he wanted to see her,  He wanted her to get better and get back to a "normal" life.
Of course, that was not going to happen.
Today, my Wife, Son, and many friends and acquaintances treat me the same way.
Now, I am not addressing the MORONS that say I am not sick!
Including an supposed MD I go to Church with.
No, I am addressing people that see something is wrong but they want me to be as I was.
So they treat me as if nothing is wrong, expecting that to make me better!
That is a noble attitude, not giving into a disease.
But it is also very frustrating and maddening to me!
Another frustrating issues is when people that KNOW I am NOT doing WELL continue to do things that aggravate me even after I have told them numerous times, that action or habit DOES AGGRAVATE ME!!
Get a CLUE, would you!!
I will give you an example and I admit it is a silly issue but it drives me up the wall.
Every time I get woke up, by the dog, the alarm, or just wake up, and my wife is still in bed, the first thing she asks me is; "What time is it?"
First of all is, we do not have a lighted clock in our room because she demands total darkness,  Second of all,  how the Hell do I now!??
I am in the same dark room you are!!!
Third of all, What difference does it make?!!
I have addressed this issue a number of times, to no avail.
Look, I am not going to get better, I am getting worse if you would just look and see.
All of your trying to make me better just makes me worse by aggravating me.
And while I am complaining, no.
never mind.
The bottom line is;  Running around the block will not make me as I once was.
Those days are gone.

<doc date=Wednesday, January 3, 2018>
Yes, almost every post I write is an update on how I am doing.
But, I have become involved in a Facebook page sponsored by LBDA.Org where I have posted some issues I have not addressed here.
The Facebook page is a closed group for LBD patients and their caregivers.
It is very informative and very helpful because I can get replies from someone going through what I am.
But, I also want to keep those of you who don't do Facebook up to date.
My LBD journey was fairly gentle up to now.
Yes, there have been some downturns that caused me issues, but I have always been able to adjust to the "New Normal"; until now.
Recent issues with angry, emotional, uncontrollable, outbursts have left me wondering about the next "Act" of LBD.
Twice, in the last month or so I have blown up over seemingly minor issues.
Today was the day we planned to take down the Christmas Tree in our Lobby.
The storage boxes were supposed to be there, magically appearing from some hidden storage area.
But, they were not there at the planned time.
I went looking for someone to tell me where the magical boxes were.
No luck.
My Wife is a bull dog when it comes to things like this and everything MUST be done on time, in a controlled, precise, manner that she directs.
So, it became my responsibility to locate the magical boxes.
A long time resident knew where the boxes were stored but she did not know where the keys were.
So, she and I went to the basement and found the secret storage area.
The lock was OPEN!!
So, we retrieved the boxes and headed to the elevator back to the first floor lobby.
This is where things got bad.
There is one elevator that goes to the basement.
Two others that go from the first floor to the sixth floor.
It seems today, the elevator that goes from the basement to the sixth floor was commandeered by morons!!
One of them was a person, living in Independent Living that should be in skilled care because that individual cannot walk, move without an electric chair, or reach the elevator buttons.
And this invalid lives on the sixth floor!!
I can't wait for the fire!!
In any case, this moron took the elevator to the basement to get some one to push floor SIX for him!!!
In any case, we waited 20 minutes for the elevator to get the boxes to the first floor lobby to take down a Christmas tree!!!
By the time I got the boxes to the Lobby I was EXPLODING!!!!!
My wife, who knows me and what I am going through, gently directed me to our apartment to cool down.
She really handled me very well and I appreciate her because she save me from further embarrassment.
You see, the "Landed Gentry Elite than live here do not know about Lewy Body Dementia, so, I obviously do not have it and I am a liar!!
And since I was ranting and raving like a lunatic, throwing my cane across the lobby, I ended saving from myself!
It makes sense to note here that recently, I have been thinking I did not need , note did I want, to move to Assisted Living.
After my blow up, I thought;  I really drove a nail in my Assisted Living coffin!!
In any case, things are getting worse for me and I am having great difficulty dealing with this recent massive downturn.
LBD has finally thrown me a pitch I cannot hit.
I give up!!
I realize I need to be in the quiet, controlled environment of Assisted Living.
I cannot deal with people and all of their issues, agendas, ignorance, and opinions.
I am finally in total control of LBD.

I have written this Blog for quite a while and had many replies from you who read my mental wanderings.
I have also read a number of articles on LBDA.Org and some other sources and my unscientific research alone with my own experiences with LBD draw a fairly interesting picture of "Who Gets LBD".
1.
Almost every person who writes about their LBD experience was well educated, intelligent, and accomplished.
2.
Almost every person I have been able to read about was in a very high pressure career and was very successful.
3.
Every person I have learned about had a "Type A" personality.
An other interesting indicator I see is that in all of the cases I can site, the individual impacted by LBD had early, then unexplained, symptoms that were completely out of character for them.
Many of these symptoms occurs 8-10 years before the individual was diagnosed with any neurological issues!!
I am sure the researchers already know al of this.
But, I just put to together and I thought you might find it interesting.

<doc date=Wednesday, December 27, 2017>
Strange as this will seem, I cannot settle on a decision to move to Assisted Living!
I know I have written before about my desires to move to AL, but the act of actually making a decision is more than I can do.
Actually, any decision is very difficult for me.
Normally, I don't have to make any decisions.
I don't run the budget, purchases, driving, home maintenance, meal preps, nothing!!
Then there is the execution of the decision.
That may be the hardest, most difficult part of the process.
for instance, I want something that I find on the Internet.
I save it, decide I want it, and then vacillate on buying it, not even telling my Wife I am interested in the item.
The, I don't make the purchase and feel deprived because I didn't!
Does not should logical or even psychologically sound for a 66 yea role person.
But that is how my brain works thanks to LBD.
Before, I made life and death decisions in Navy Gun Mounts while firing life ammunition in Combat!!
I would not want to try that today.
So, my wife is going to just have to make this decision.
The Doctor has already said she thought it was time.
We will see.

This is a continuation of my last post.
I am completely miserable.
I cannot watch anything on television that does not agitate me at night.
Even Curling makes me angry.
Not the sport but the morons announcing the game!
I hate everything about my life and I do not want to do anything.
If I try to go to sleep, I have to deal with deep, dark, thoughts until until I fall to sleep.
I am very snippy with my wife no matter what she says or does.
That is not normal for me at all.
And it is not good for my wife.
I feel completely alone and abandoned in my life.
I have no none to talk to here at Azalea Trace because I have nothing in common with anyone here.
Combine that with the snooty attitude of many of the "Landed Gentry" elites here and I am treated like chattel.
I guess I need a visit with my Psychologist.
That will have to wait until January.

Christmas has NEVER been a happy time for me.
I have very few happy memories of Christmas and man, many sad, angry memories of this time of the year.
Yes, the celebration of the birth of our Savior is supposed to be joyous.
But humanity, and families have made Christmas terrible.
And LBD has made Christmas even more difficult for me.
I can offer others hints about dealing with this time of the year.
But, I just cannot live with this time of the year myself.
And since my LBD issues have multiplied recently, I am really having issues this Christmas.
Then add the issues of living where I live with a bunch of uppity snobs that think everyone should wait on them hand and foot, that treat me and my wife as interlopers that do not belong here, and I am beside myself.
Today, I had another altercation with one of the more difficult residents.
Not that I did anything, other than support our wonderful Director.
But this person is one of the most negative, unhappy, self-centered, people I have ever met!
This individual actually assaulted my wife today for supporting our Director.
Now, remember, assault is verbal, battery is physical!!
But we, and especially me, do not need this type of treatment.
It is not the first time this person has been rude, crude, and verbally abusive to us.
And frankly, I am sick of it.
Another person here, who thinks their solid waste does not stink, rascally asked me how people like us could afford living here!
And there people have the Christmas spirit?!
Look, I would move out if I could.
But, that is not the answer.
But, these are the same individuals that tell me there is nothing wrong with me!
I am an unhappy person.
And this time of the year it is multiplied by the past.
Since we moved here, I have done my best to serve the community.
Now, I think it is time to take care of us.
I am withdrawing from any volunteer work her at Azalea Trace.
I am done!!
Period!!
And, we will never ride on the Azalea Trace bus when that individual is on the bus.
It is just that easy.

<doc date=Saturday, December 9, 2017>
Merry Christmas to all of my family and friends!
Linda and I pray you have a blessed, joyous, family filled Christmas Season!!
Christmas has always been an emotionally difficult season for me.
Long before LBD, I suffered with depression issues during Christmas because of the situation of my birth and upbringing.
But, since I turned my life over to Jesus Christ, Christmas has been easier.
Not easy, but easier on me.
We concentrate on the Birth of the Messiah and not the commercial side of Christmas.
But, LBD has made Christmas more difficult in recent years and this year is going to be even more difficult for me and therefore my Wife!
All of us with LBD have depression and anxiety issues.
But, the social gatherings, noise, activity, and pressure to be happy and joyous make those problems exponentially worse for us.
The question we need to answer is;  How do we deal with our depression, anxiety, and anger, during the many mandatory social events of the Christmas season?
I have read about this topic and have come up with some suggestions.
First; concentrate on the good memories!
We all have Holiday horror stories.
Try to put them in the background and concentrate on the good events you remember from your youth, your early marriage, your children's younger years.
Second; Don't do too much!
Everything in moderation.
We have a tendency to try to do what we used to do when we were 20!!
Trust me, you can't!
Spouses, don't schedule so many events, visits, meals.
And, don't have the entire family over to the house for the entire day!
This will drive your Dementia patient into depression, anxiety, and anger overload!!
Third;  Watch your Dementia spouse closely through the event.
If they become agitated, overwhelmed, tired, or introspective, spend some one on one time with them.
Have a favorite friend of relative get them off in a comfortable cove and quietly discuss how they are doing.
Or, let the Dementia patient take a nap!
Fourth;  Don't schedule events everyday!!
Your LBD patient need time to decompress and rest.
I bring these suggestions to you based on my experiences and what I have read from other professional sites.
I am sure you have other suggestions that I have missed.
The key is, keep the well being of your LBD spouse in mind throughout the Christmas season.
Take time to be alone with him or her.
Concentrate on the good times!
And enjoy each other.
Every day is precious to us.

I have said before that I want to move to Assisted Living.
Many people ask me why and I had various answers based on care, comfort, and getting comfortable before I am completely confused by Dementia.
All, I believe are on target.
But, last night I finally got the real answer.
If you are a long time reader of my blog, you know I spent the majority of my adult life in the Navy.
I was a Navy Chief!
I retired as a Master Chief.
I lived in the "Chief's Quarters"!
Unlike any other Military branch, the Navy E-7 thru E-9 community live separately as directed by law.
It was a tradition that dates back to the British Navy.
All Navies of the free world hold the same tradition.
Chiefs berth, eat, and live totally separate from the rest of the Enlisted crew and the Officers.
It is a wonderful tradition that honors those who really make the ship function.
It is also a wonderful way to life that I loved.
Assisted Living and Memory Support communities remind me of the Chief's Quarters!!
Separate dining, separate lounges, separate berthing.
People to take care of your every need.
Even someone to wake you up in the morning!!
At least now, I know why Assisted Living hold my interest so much.
I am so comfortable when I am there.
I feel special, cared for, and at home.
Hopefully it won't be too long before I move back into the Chief's Quarters!
I can't wait.

This evening I went to take out to get dinner.
We do that often because I do not do well with people in the evening.
One of the women I know and get along with was having a birthday.
So, I told her husband we should sing Happy Birthday to her and he agreed.
We all sang and she font angry!
She scowled at me and said: "I did not appreciate that!"
Why, because you are having a birthday?
You must have had some before.
Is it because we honored you with a Birthday Song?
I apologized of course.
But, it upset me and ruined my night.
Look, I admit I do not understand why old women die their hair, wear body filler make up, and try to look 40 years younger than the are.
But, we did not use her age in the song!
But, I guess having a Birthday means you are getting older.
Duh!!
You are older than dirt now!
Be glad you are still breathing you self-centered bag!!
For me, dealing with people and all their baggage is overwhelming.
I want to live in a Dementia Care facility where I am with residents that are on the same path as me and a staff that understands me.
I am sick of phony, landed gentry, uppity, snooty, faux socialites that only care about themselves!!
Moving here was a mistake for me!!
I wish I could use some Sailor language here.
But, I will control myself for the moment.

There is a joke about a young man who finds a "Genie Lamp" in the beach in San Diego.
The Genie is angry that he was woke up and tells the young man he will only get one wish.
The Young Man asks the Genie to build a bridge from San Diego to Hawaii because he was afraid to fly or ride on ships and always wanted to see Hawaii.
The Genie said; "Do you have any idea how hard that would be?!
Pick another wish."
Te Young man then said:  "Oh, I never did well with Women, so I want you to make it so I understand how a Woman's mind works."
The Genie replies;  " How big do you want that bridge, two or four lanes?"
Well, Men are even harder to understand.
Especially men facing their own death.
Those of us who served in the Military in actual combat positions, put our lives on the line and many times came very, very, close to death, without giving it a second thought except for a laugh over a beer later.
But, let that same combat vet be diagnosed with a life threatening disease of condition and he becomes very introspective and he will NOT discuss his fears with his wife, children, or friends.
There is a man who lives where I do who is in tough shape.
He knows he will not get better and is only looking his own downhill journey to death.
Not an honorable death defending our Nation or saving his friends lives, or the ship.
Instead, he is weak, unable to do anything he did for the 34 years he served in the Navy, and is a shadow of his former self!
To discuss this with someone who knew him when he was rough, tough, strong, mean, and the authority on anything and everything, would show him in his weakened state.
Trust me, that ain't going to happen.
So, he is a grouch, difficult to talk too, and disconnected mentally from those he loved and knows.
Men, like my friend and me, need a neutral party to talk to.
To unload on.
A Pastor, a Psychologist, or a Nurse.
But that individual need someone to talk too!!
I have a Pastor and a Psychologist I unload on.
They are both extremely helpful to me and for me.
But, you, the friend, wife, son, of a man facing his demise must connect your loved one to a neutral party.
If you do not, you are not helping your loved one find some happiness in his last days.
Yes, I would have been happier if I died a Combat Death.
But, here I am, facing a much more mundane death.
My Psychologist and Pastor helped me understand I am still the man I was and  that I still have value.
I told my friends Wife the same thing today.
That's all I can do.
I hope and pray she takes my advice.

I have a friend here at Azalea Trace that has mid-stage Dementia.
Which one is up for grabs seeing that accurate neurological diagnosis are very difficult to get her in East Lower Alabama!
In any case, he fell and broke three ribs about two weeks ago.
Since then, he fell again and broke a hip, which required surgery.
Naturally the doctors used General Anesthesia.
The General Anesthesia has severely and negatively impacted his Dementia!
There are at least two very good medical level articles on the Levy Body Dementia Association Web Site (LBDA.ORG) that address this issue.
My friend will never return to where he was before the surgery!
I am no doctor, but after visiting him today, it is my opinion he will never get out of bed again.
I am upset for him and for me.
If you have a Dementia or are the caregiver for someone with Dementia, PLEASE read the articles on the LBDA.org site about the impact of General Anesthesia on Dementia patients.
Fore warned is fore armed.

We were busy yesterday.
Too busy!
We each had a doctors appointment with our GP, both at the same place.
They were slow as usual and I got agitated!
The, since we were in the town over from Pensacola, we did some shopping we needed to do and ate lunch.
We came home and an hour later had a scheduled Vet appointment for Zeus, the Winder Dog!
All three medical appointments went as expected.
Then, I had to do my usual Monday laundry in the evening to be ready for Tuesday.
Tuesday will not be much better since my Wife has an appointment for a medical test after her BSF Leaders meeting.
I am preaching at the Skilled Nursing Facility for the Staff Chaplain at 10 AM, so Tuesday will be busy too!
Busy days are difficult for me.
I get agitated and angry over any little thing.
Even riding in the care causes me issues!
Maybe because the illiterate morons that live here can't drive!!
A topic of my GP appointment, among many, was my left shoulder.
The rotator cuff is torn and needs repair.
We have known that for a long time.
But the pain is getting worse and I am loosing mobility in my left arm.
I even have difficulties drying myself after a shower.
BUT, haven surgery under a General Anesthesia is not a good idea for LBD patients.
LBDA has two new articles on this tops that I found very good and very concerning.
The medical evidence is that General Anesthesia accelerates and advances the impact of Dementia in LBD patients.
My GP know this and told me I have to make a quality of life decision.
In other words, is the pain and immobility more of an issue than the possible loss of cognitive ability!
I have not come to terms with that yet.
My Wife is against the surgery but she does not want me in pain either.
I will Pray about this and seek God's will.

As the sun goes down, my mind gets trapped an an endless thought process of things I still want to do but can't!
Every night I go through this torture.
The thoughts of unrealized plans, dreams, and adventures, mixed with the mistakes, failures, and dumb decisions I made through my life, torture me.
Actual accomplishments, victories, fun times, never come to mind at night.
Just things I never did or thing I failed at.
Yes, I know it is "Sundowning" but knowing what it is does not help me get through the nightly torture.
Lately, some disorientation has been mixed in with this nightly ordeal, so I am confused about timing of events and where I am in the process.
This disorientation has recently been mixed with thoughts of my future!
Yes, that is strange.
Those thoughts are of how things will be as my LBD journey gets more difficult.
Some of those thoughts are coming to fruition now.
Some I know are a forewarning of my soon to be future.
I have written that the recent downturn has been difficult and that is fully true.
But what is to come, will be even worse.
The neurologist that first diagnosed me never told me about what was to come.
Her view was to let it happen without warning.
My thirst for knowledge and the Internet defeated her plan, which not looks like a good plan, in retrospect.

If you have read this blog for a while, you know my two miniature poodles passed away due to old age issues between last Thanksgiving, (Cherie) and last March (Marcel).
Two weekends ago we attended the Barktoberfest here in Pensacola and even though we said we would NEVER have another pet, a rescue Chihuahua, who is two years old, stole my heart!
When I held him, he chewed on y beard and kissed me!
He has been with us since then.
He is very quiet for a Chihuahua.
He gets along well with other dogs and everyone!
He is a prize and just what I needed.
He loves to walk and loves the new Bark Park here at Azalea Trace!!
He runs around playing with other dogs and chasing the ball, flying through the wind.
He is a joy to watch and have.

When you live in a retirement community, you have to deal with people of many dispositions.
I always try to be friendly and positive.
Some people, on the other hand, specialize in being negative!
People of that ilk can find NOTHING good about anything!
I encounter an individuals like that numerous times each week.
Some of them are palatable and some of them are REPULSIVE!!
The most repulsive of this ilk rode on the Bus with me today.
That individual complained, pouted, and bitched the entire trip to and from our destination.
That individual's negative attitude set me off for the rest of the day!
This individual know everything, knows more than anyone, and is, in this individuals personal opinion, the only person in the world that matters!!
I have had a screaming headache, been grouchy, and out of sorts since I returned to the community.
If that individual is that dissatisfied with living here, they should move.
I told my wife that if that individual gets on a bus from the community that I was going to ride on, I am getting off!!
We can drive to where ever we want and be away from that individuals constant complaining, carping, and wanting everything their way regardless of how it impacts others!!
As a matter of fact, I may move just to get away from that miserable asshole!!
Having LBD impacts my ability to deal with people of this ilk in a civil manner.
I try, but I pay the price for it in a ruined day!
Mom used to say;  "If you can't say something nice, don't say anything at all!!"
I know one person who need to follow that advice.
I never said anything to that individual and I have not, the many times that person has complained, denigrated, and whined, about everything in the world.
But, one day, my filters will be completely off and then, "POW!!
Right in the Kisser!!"
as Jackie Gleason used to say.

As we all know, Lewy Body Dementia is a journey of ups and downs.
Recently, I had a significant downward swing that has brought unexpected issues that I was just not ready for.
Thankfully, my Wife has been very observant and has been intone with these changes even though I have not been.
I even have difficulties describing the changes I have recently experienced but I can tell you they are very unnerving.
I am much more emotional and I really cannot tell you why.
My memory has decreased even more and I am now having issues remembering long term memories.
My coordination is worse and I my depth perception and overall vision has gotten much worse.
You know I no longer drive and that is a good thing!
The most frustrating issues of this downturn is that I am in uncharted and unexpected territory.
I just never thought it would be this way!
Yes, I realize my judgment is impaired but I am surprised, shocked and somewhat depressed!
I believe we are now in the more difficult areas of my journey!
Again, my inability to describe what is happening to me is as frustrations as the issues themselves! 
</doc>
<doc date=Friday, October 27, 2017>
When I am in moderate size groups of people and anything is expected of me, that experience, no matter how long it is, makes me extremely agitated, angry, and overwhelmed.
I get very quiet and have a need to escape the group and get to my safe place!
I have had this problems in increasing levels and it is now becoming overwhelming for me.
When I get back to the apartment, I am angry and often respond to simple comments in a very nasty manner!
This normally leads to me going to bed, regardless of the time of day.
My wife see's this and understands it on a surface level.
But, she often tries to continue as if nothing is wrong but I'll I explode over something that is trivial!
It IS a large LBD indicator and a reason many of us move to Assiste Living or a Memory Support Community.
It will lead me to that decision sooner rather than later.

Last weekend my Son and I went to see my Grandson at Fort Benning.
He is waiting Advanced Training.
My Wife thought it would be a good trip for me and that time alone with our Son would be good.
It was to be with our Son and great to see our Grandson, but being away from my Wife was not a good idea.
I was disoriented and upset much of the time.
My Son is not attuned to the signals I send out.
He is young and on the go all the time.
I am good for one; or maybe on a good day, two; events in one day!
Without recounting the two days away from my Wife, travel or even life away from my Wife and away from home is something I will never do again.
Enough said!

I need to get a copy of a DVD that I saw at the Alzheimer's Association facility in Norfolk, Virginia.
The story line was that of a Professional woman who was diagnosed with Alzheimer's while still in her High Profile job.
The video was her personal documentation about her journey from her first symptoms until she no longer could communicate.
I found this video very helpful at explaining the progression of dementia's in general.
I would love to purchase a copy of this video for the Memory Support Group her at Azalea Trace and in fact for all of the ACTS Communities.
So, if you can help, please let me know!!
Why do I ask of this help?
I am getting tired of people questing my veracity!
Enough said!

I have been experiencing some leg movement as I go to sleep at night.
Naturally, based on television ads, I thought it was Restless Leg Syndrome.
My Neurologist even agreed.
But, after doing some research I discovered it is Myoclonic Jerking!!
This is a involuntary contraction of the muscles and sometimes an involuntary release of muscles.
In m case, it is involuntary contractions of my leg muscles and it is a common symptom for LBD patients!
Do RLS medications work for Myoclonic Jerking?
I don't know.
But, I sent my Neurologist an email on their Portal and asked Her!
I believe I am providing Her a great LBD education.
I always knew I was a Lab Rat, now I have proof!!
There there is a wealth of information on the Internet from reliable sources about Lewy Body Dementia.
I do not expect my doctors to know everything about every condition and drug.
I believe it is my responsibility to learn as much as I can about my disease and share that information with my doctors and anyone else who is interested.
My health and treatment are at least partially my responsibility.

I have written this blog from my heart.
I have NOT held back in any way.
I know there are folks that read this blog who are not involved in LBD in any manner.
They read it for various reasons and I appreciate their desire curiosity about LBD and me.
But, if you read this blog, you must understand why I write it.
The purpose of the blog is;  1.
To leave a journal of my LBD journey for my family and friends.
2.
To let other LBD patients and caregivers they are not alone.
3.
To educate the medical professionals about the effects of LBD.
While this blog has been recognized a number of times, that is not why I continue to write.
It's nice to be recognized and have great readership.
But it is not the reason I write.
But, thanks!
Why am I saying this?
Just to make sure everyone know where I am coming from.
LBD is no cake walk.
it is frustrating, angering, gut wrenching, confusing, and self-centered.
On another but related note;  My recent issues have made me realize I need more care and I intend to seek a move to Assisted Living after the first of the year.
There are financial reasons for that date, but by then, I will be ready in every way.
This move will also help my Wife by relieving her of some of the responsibilities of keeping track of me 24/7/365.
Also, one of my friends here at Azalea Trace said something to me that made extreme sense!!
He said; "People don't move to Assisted Living in time to enjoy it and benefit from the care it provides."
He is correct!
I have seen people delay they moves to Assisted Living until they are so infirm they are quickly moved to Skilled Care.
They never benefited from Assisted Living because they were so infirm they were past the benefits of Assisted Living!
I see a move to Assisted Living as a life extender, both cognitively and physically!
So, there is the unvarnished truth and why I write what I do.
I hope everyone understands.

I preached today for the staff Chaplain here at Azalea Trace.
I am filling n for him for the next few weeks because he is on a Mission Trip to Central America.
I am very proud of him and his Wife and honored to be able to help him this way.
When I was setting up for services in the beautiful Chapel in Willow Brook Court, a man came in to the Chapel.
I recognized him from Independent living but he was not the same man!
In a very short time, Dementia, of what type I do not know, has completely changed this man.
He did not recognize me and I could tell from his actions he felt threatened and unsafe in his surroundings.
He was being cared for by one of the wonderful Home Health Professionals here at Azalea and was in very good hands.
Just the same, his appearance and demeanor shocked me!
How could this seemingly vibrant man go sown hill so quickly.
My Dementia journey has been gradual and fairly gentle up to know.
But he obviously has been run over by a truck named Dementia!
His condition has caught seed me to reevaluate my position and my life choices for the future.
I know my Dementia is speeding up and getting more virulent.
Maybe I will be the man who shocks someone ion the near future.

We had our weekly Memory Support Group today and Kathryn from Covenant Care was our facilitator.
She leads our group the first Wednesday of each month.
She is well versed in Dementia care and has a heart for us.
She was able to engage a number of our attendees in open discussions about their symptoms and that was very constructive.
She was discussing the fact that Dementia patients sometimes see their spouses as nurses, outsiders, or even their parent!
This answered a question I had!!
I have begun to address my Wife as "MOM"!
For instance, we are in the car, she is driving and I will say;  "look at that Mom!"
I would hear myself say that a wonder, where did that come from?
Now I know.
But, it angered me that I did no see this coming!
I pride myself in understanding my disease and helping other Dementia patients.
Instead, I needed help and Kathryn had it!!
am very thankful for her!!
My symptoms are getting more complicated and difficult and I no longer can self-diagnose them.

Many emotions rush through my mind at night because of "Sundowning".
Last night, as I was drifting off to sleep, I was SNAPPED awake by an overwhelming need to run away fro where I was!!
I was in a panic and I knew I needed to get away from the location I was in.
For what reason, I do not know.
But it was a real fear, flight or fight, reaction!!
It passed soon enough and I was able to settle down and go to sleep.
But each time I woke up to go to the bathroom, that emotion was in my thoughts and it continued after I got up this morning.
Today is Tuesday and my Wife has her Leaders Group for Bible Study Fellowship, so I am alone.
I had a number of errands to run and a meeting to attend, so my morning has been directed and I have had little time to just sit and think, until now.
But, now, as I write this, I am trying to understand that "Flee" emotion that I experienced last night.
There is nothing here that frightens me, so they would not seem to be the issue.
Just the same, I have no plausible reason for last nights thoughts except maybe, LBD is just finding another way to mess with me.

Today, I have experienced the HIGHS and lows of Lewy Body Dementia.
Azalea Trace has celebrated Active Aging Week and there has been some wonderful activities all week.
Today, we had Hot Air Balloon rides early in the morning, right here on our campus!
I have never ridden in a Hot Air Balloon but today,  thanks to Azalea Trace we got to experience Hot Air Ballooning.
Yes, it was a tethered ride, but we still floated with only the power of heated air!
We were high enough to look over the stately tree tops and see the Escambia Bay!!
It was exciting and exhilarating!
But the remainder of the day has been depressing and difficult to walk through.
The experience of this morning brought back many memories of the exciting and dangerous things I did during my Navy career.
It all was brought to the forefront of my mind, and those thoughts have illustrated to me that I will never do anything like that again and that my life is drawing to a close.
That does not bother me but it is something that is difficult to deal with and I am not really sure I am dealing with it very well.
I miss my Navy buddies and the camaraderie of those friendships.
I miss not being able to go places, drive, take care of my own issues, like haircuts or clothes shopping.
I miss being independent, capable, and in charge.
I have come to understand Pensacola is my final destination.
It is the last place I thought I would end up, but not the worst place to be.
Right now, the emotions of the day have overwhelmed me and It is time to retreat to the safety of my bed.
Maybe I will address this more tomorrow,

We went to to Long Horn lunch today.
I have been trying to get my Wife to eat at Long Horn Steak House for a month!
She agreed today and we had a great meal.
We also had a discussion about my LBD and how she is dealing with it.
Now remember, my social filters are not functioning!
I was talking about the Memory Support Group and how some of the spouses do not take advantage of the information available about the different dementia's.
I then told my Wife she was not taking advantage of information I had discovered and made available to her.
She then told me this;  I want you the way you were, while understand you need to be comfortable the way you are!
That was an eye opener!!
She brought back to my memory how my Dad reacted to my Mom's end days, suffering with Cancer.
He would say;  "All she needs to do is get up and walk around the block,  Ten she will feel better."
My Wife told me, my Dad did not want Mom to be sick and that was his way to deal with it.
She also said those of us with Dementia are each different just as all caregivers are.
I agree with that.
But I do not understand why a Spouse would not want every bit of information about the disease their spouse had, and then use that information to make the Spouse's life easier, more comfortable, and better.
Denying the fact that the Spouse has a disease does nothing to help that person.
It may make the Caregiver Spouse feel better, but that seem selfish to me.
But, I am not the caregiver.
LBD, and all Dementia's are a tough, confusing journey for both the patient and the caregiver.
I believe the more factual information both people have, the better both people will be able to deal with the disease.
Of course, I could be wrong.

Today, while my Wife was at her weekly Bible Study and I was home alone, I was gazing out our patio doors and all of the sudden, I was wondering why the cars I saw did not have front license plates!
Virginia has front license plates and you can get a ticket if you don't have a front license plate!!
Then, it came to me that I was in Florida and not Virginia.
The question then became;  How the Hell did I get to Florida!!??
I spent quite a few minutes contemplating that question.
Then, I realized we lived in Florida.
Things are getting confusing, at least sometimes.

All of my conversations revert to my Navy life!
I never get involved in any conversation about events of today!
I can change the topic and flow of any conversation to my Navy life!
Today, does not exist in my mind!!
As a matter of fact, I am not interested in the events of today!
This is not abnormal for Dementia patients, but it illustrates to me, and anyone who cares about me, where I am in my LBD journey.
I am comfortable with my memories and experiences from my 40 years with the Navy.
I am uncomfortable with today's events and I don't like the culture of today's America or the World in general.
So, instead of dealing with things I dislike, even hate, I regress to where I am comfortable,  From what I have learned, this will progress even more.
I am OK with that.
As a matter of fact, I welcome it.
Those around me may not like it, but, that is there problem.
I am a the one with LBD!

<doc date=Friday, September 22, 2017>
In the beginning, people I knew were shocked, upset, even sad about my LBD diagnosis.
Now, in many cases LBD is a slowly progressing disease.
Especially with the new drugs that are available If and ONLY IF they are prescribed very early which my Neurologist in Norfolk, Virginia did.
And you should also know that LBD is a cyclic disease.
Ups and downs, that occur in an unpredictable manner.
Then there is "Showtime" that occurs when people not normally in the LBD patient's circle are around.
During "Showtime" episodes, the LBD patient seems "normal".
All this being said, it has been 5 or more years since my early diagnosis and people treat me very differential now.
They seem aggravated when I mention my disease as if they are very tired of me and LBD.
People expect me to have all the stamina, mental acuity, attention span and capabilities of someone without LBD!
When situation overwhelm me, they are annoyed!
Even angry and disappointed with me.
They want me to do things and be in situations that overwhelm me and tire me out quickly and leave me wasted!
I realize it must be frustrating to those around me to look and me and believe in their mind I am not sick!
But, they do not see the total picture.
They have watched me slowly deteriorate so they do not realize it is occurring.
For instance, no one can tell me when my hair turned grey and then white!
It just happened over a long period of time.
Well, that is how LBD has robbed me of mental and physical abilities.
Today after some running around doing some financial things, we w net to the commissary.
My wife likes to keep bottled water around.
We bought a 24 bottled case of water and I cannot carry that any distance at all.
That fact escaped her mind.
The fact that I had to get a cart to take our small grocery load to the apartment was just not in her mind!
She was frustrated with me.
Much like my previous post, she forgets I am impacted by LBD and wants me to be "ME".
When I am not "ME" she unconsciously gets upset.
It is not her fault, it is a normal reaction to a situation she hates.
But, like I said in my last post, these episodes take my DIGNITY from me.
I am reduced to someone who is worthless!
Patience for the LBD patients spouse, family member,  or caregiver is the most important quality!!
Compassion is nice, but patience is mandatory!

Many of you know I spent 40 years with the United States Navy.
I was the Force Master Chief of the Surface Forces, Atlantic Fleet, a Command Master Chief of a Destroyer and an A-6 Air Squadron, Leading Gunners Mate on numerous ships.
The Gunner's Mate Detailer, and Instructor at Gun School, Great Lakes.
As a Civil Servant for the Navy, I was a Gun Mounts and Turrets Tech Rep, The Gun Systems Replacement Manager, the Programs Branch Head, the Search Radar Branch Head, and had numerous collateral duties of note, like the recovery of the USS Cole and the repair of the MCM's in Bahrain.
Needless to say, I had a very impressive, responsible, productive, Navy Career.
Now, my cognitive skills are not what they used to be and it shows, everyday.
The challenge for the caregiver or spouse is to NOT treat me like a mental midget!
A more correct way to express this is to say;  Spouses and caregivers should respect the Dementia Patients DIGNITY!
I try, everyday, to be helpful, useful, and productive.
If I am asked to do something, I do it to the best of my ability.
And, although what I produce, write, make, may not be grammatically perfect, written the way you would write it, or done in a manner you would have, please don't redo what I did.
If you do not want to accept what I do, don't ask me to do it!
This treatment causes me to be angry, resentful and to withdraw from all contact!
Telling me I did not meet your expectations, through your actions, facial expressions, or comments, does nothing to make me feel useful or wanted.
Instead, those actions invoke feelings of uselessness and give me the idea I am not wanted.
Does this sound a little sensitive to you?
Well, I am sensitive.
I was a powerful man, able to do things most of you can't even imagine.
When I said things, brought forth facts, and made decisions, high ranking Navy Officers and Civilians listened and most often acted!!
Now, it seems there is nothing I can do right and no one that listens to me.
I have lost my Personal Dignity!
If you are a caregiver or spouse of a Dementia Patient, read and heed!

As I said in the last post, the MRA showed all was normal as far as the blood flow in my brain.
That was wonderful news.
As the lower dose of Effexor takes hold, it seems my headaches and BP are decreasing, very slowly.
I have dealt with a "Boil" on the back of my neck for 11 days, that required medical attention every other day.
They took my BP each time and except for one day, it was in the 139/90 range.
That is better tan a few weeks ago.
I still get short, intense headaches when I cough or sneeze.
But, all in all, I think things are going in the right direction.
I even went and played Pool last Wednesday.
The first time in at least three months.
I consider that good news since I have been pretty much anti-social for a while.
This may be one of the signature LBD positive swings I have experienced since I was first diagnosed.
I have learned to appreciate these respites and fear them at the same time, because they always lead to a big downward turn!
But, I will enjoy the good times while they are here.

Yesterday, I had an MRA to see if I had any vascular damage in my brain, possibly caused by high blood pressure.
Praise God, there is no aneurism or arterial weakness detected!
While I was not worried, I was concerned.
I can honestly say, it is only God's providence that has kept me through this disease.
That being said, what next?
I asked my neurologist to address the high BP issues.
I do not want to increase my Effexor dosage so some sort of BP med seems to be in order, on my mind.
I truly hate what Effexor did to me and I blame that on the so called neurologist  had when I first moved to Pensacola.
He elevated my Effexor dosage much higher than necessary.
I trusted him and He violated that trust.
Never again!
On other issues, I am still dealing with this "Boil" issue.
I still have a drain in the incision and while it is decreasing, it is still draining.
Having the drain reinstalled every other day in painful and annoying.
Hopefully, tomorrow will be the last visit for this issue.
Evenings are getting more difficult.
Noise causes agitation and anger in increasing volume.
More and more, television viewing is bad for me most of the time.
Loud commercials seem to dominate television.
News programs are mostly commercials and inane dribble.
Local news is nonexistent her in Pensacola.
I find myself in bed, earlier and earlier.
Bed is my safe area.
I hope the headaches decrease soon.

We started a Memory Support Group here at Azalea Trace about 6 months ago.
It is made up of individuals that have a dementia or some dementia symptoms.
The basis of the group is self-support.
We discuss our symptoms, how we are dealing with those issues, and get feedback from other group members that either have the same issues or are earlier in their Dementia journey and want to know what the future may hold.
We have had a number of Health Professionals meet with us to educate us on Dementia issues and related health issues like choking, falling, exercise.
Today, our group had a luncheon with the new Director of Azalea Trace, Ms. Tammy Hardy-Farber has extensive training in Dementia care and is very up to date on the new care methods!
She gave us some information of the new construction of the extension of our Skilled and Assisted Living facilities.
Both of these communities will have Dementia Care Communities.
This is exciting news and very much needed.
I love the fact that our Director and all of the Staff here at Azalea Trace support or Group.
Tammy especial cares about Dementia care since Her Father in Law died of Alzheimer's.
She is a visionary in Dementia care!
We are truly in good hands!

The last couple of weeks I have been dealing with "Boils"!
I have not had a Boil since I was 6!
I have terrible memories of my Mom lancing my boils with a razor blade.
No Novocaine!
But, today, we went to the Urgent Care facility to have this Grande Boil felt with.
Naturally, that meant lancing it.
Needless to say, it was brutal, even with Novocaine!!
The Doctor pressed so hard on the Boil to get some of the stuff out that my neck muscles are sore!!
He told us "Boils" are very common in Florida!!
Who knew?!
I bet the Tourist Association does not include that in the "Come to Florida" brochure!
And, to add insult to injury, I have to go back tomorrow morning to have the "Packing" changed!

My Sister, from Cleveland, came for a short visit this week thanks to Her son and Daughter's generous gift of a flight to Pensacola!
It was  Wonderful to see her.
We went to Cleveland last year but she was in the Hospital the entire time.
Since then, she has miraculously recovered!
She looks 20 years younger and much healthier.
We had a great visit, including a big dinner with our Son and His family.
What a great night.
She departed very early this morning and I took a nap when we returned to our apartment.
I am completely exhausted!
Since I am so dependent on my routine, as most Dementia patients are, any disruption is difficult.
Also, you may understand the concept of "Show Time" in LBD patients.
Well, I stayed in "Showtime" for four days!
That wore me out.
Still, I am so happy she came to visit and I would rather have her here for another four days regardless of how tired it makes me.
So, I will recover, slowly.
But I will miss her company for a long time.
Another note;  My MRA is final scheduled for 12 September.
We will see what that reveals, if anything.

The Internet is a wonderful source of information.
I did some research and depending on the type of damage in my rain, if there is any at all, there is an option of using a stint, much like they do for heart blockages.
But, in the brain aneurysm case, the stint strengthens the blood vessel.
Of course, there is also the option for brain surgery that requires opening the skull.
But that seems to be for the occurrence of bursting of the aneurysm.
So, there are options, again based on the severity of the damage.
And again, there may not be any damage yet!
We will just have to wait and see.

I have been told so many times that I do not have Lewy Body Dementia that it has become "Fighting Words" for me!
Today I went to a Navy Cryptology Museum here in Pensacola with another resident from where I live.
He asked me to go because he needed my Military ID care for access to the base!
He was honest about that.
He drove, sort of   Honest, if he can drive a car on the road, I can drive a car in a NASCAR race!!
During the ride home, he told me I did not have Dementia!
How would he know, he was a Cryptologist!?
But, he is old and I let it pass.
But, his comment made me do some research on Dementia.
One of the symptoms of Dementia patients, according to the Alzheimer's Association, is that the person with Dementia, lives in the past they are comfortable with.
In other words, that comfortable past is what they talk about and think about most of the time.
I had just spent two hours talking about my Navy experiences!!
Before that, I spent 90 minutes on the telephone with my BEST Friend, another retired Navy Chief Gunner's Mate,  talking about our Navy experience, old Shipmates, and Gun Mounts!!
Get the picture?
Not to mention that every exciting event in my life, happened in or was related to the Navy.
So naturally, I talk about them anytime I get a chance!
My dreams, what I think about before I go to sleep, what I think about when I am awake, is Navy!!
I am completely unattached to today's world, with the exception to what is occurring to our Navy ships.
But, I apply my past knowledge to their plight!
I have most of the other symptoms, but this one is something anyone who knows anything about Dementia should recognize!
Especially someone who spent two hours alone with me!
As Jackie Gleason often said;  "One of these days, POW, right in the kisser!"

With the head pain issues and high BP, my neurologist has decided to order a MRA of my brain.
They are worried about possible strokes and the head pains concentrated in the left side of my head as I wrote about before, have them worried.
The MRA test that is ordered looks at the blood vessels in my brain to see if they are clogged or bulging.
Since the headaches have not decreased, I believe this is a good course of action.
I will keep you informed.

I am BLESSED  to have a Neurologist's Office that is proactive and very caring.
My Neurologist is young and embraces technology.
They have an email portal that enables me to have near realtime communications with the staff.
Since I went back on Effexor, and even during the time I was off Effexor, I kept my Doctors informed of how I was doing and the issues I was having.
I told you before that during the time I was off Effexor, my BP spiked and caused me headaches, dizziness, and other issues like muffled hearing.
Well, the BP is lower but not where it was before I went off the mega dose of Effexor.
That is because of the autonomic issues in my brain due to LBD.
However, my Neurologist is worried that the earaches that increase when I sneeze, cough, exert myself, and get my head lower than my waist, may be a symptom of something going wrong in my brain, de to the increased BP.
So, they have me monitoring my BP and headache location and intensity and then reporting it, daily, on the email portal!!
Not bad.
The head pain is located around my left eye, left forehead area and radiates behind my left ear.
It intensifies when I cough, sneeze, exert myself, or get my head lower than my waist.
Why, I do not know.
However, the neurologist told me in an email she was probably going to do another brain scan and possible put me on a mild BP med.
Makes sense to me.
The good part is, I do not have to go into the office to get this information!!
Isn't technology wonderful!

It has been a couple of weeks since I went back to taking a low dose of Effexor XR.
Many of the negative issues are gone.
But the headaches that come on when I sneeze, cough, or bend down with my head lower than my body are still there.
Those headaches are sudden and sharp, located in my forehead area and behind my left eye.
My BP has dropped to 135/85 when I am sitting in the chair, an improvement over the 160/110 readings before I went back on Effexor XR.
This issue is directly related to the Autonomic Dysfunction issues caused by LBD.
I am a text book case!!
The Neurologist is concerned about them and is considering placing me on a BP med and ordering another, more specific, brain scan.
I agree with both of these approaches.
I am also experiencing agitation, anger, and angry outbursts, but not as severe as I was before I went back on Effexor XR.
This is an balancing act.
Getting me back in physical and emotional balance while trying to retain some emotional release.
I do not envy my neurologist!

Our Middle Grandson is in Army Boot Camp at Fort Benning Georgia.
This weekend is Family Weekend.
He is close to graduation and I guess the Army does things different than we did in the Navy in 1969!
We are going up, alone with His Wife, and Parents.
It is only a 3 hour drive, so that part is good.
But my Wife's preparations for any trip, be it a week or a month, is a painful litany of lists, walking back and forth, looking in every nook and cranny in the apartment, and asking me a hundred time what outfit she should wear.
She has always been a very nervous traveler.
And it has always bothered me, but no, with LBD, her gyrations now drive me crazy!
She has to pack enough for a month in the arctic!
I take two pair of skivvies and a tooth brush!
But the most disturbing part for me is it has lasted ALL day!!
And now into the night, my most difficult time.
I have tole her this many times.
to no avail.
She does what she does!!
She wants to be equipped for any happenstance!
Heck, I never took as much stuff on an 8 month deployment as she does for a two day trip!!
I hate travel now.
I never really liked travel, but now it is a bridge too far and the preparation is too painful.
But, once there, I hope we will have a good and interesting time.
Until then, I have to endure the skittering around and the constant quest to take more things!

We met with my Neurologist today.
She is a caring, professional, medical professional that I respect and trust.
We discussed the unfortunate Effexor experiment and how I am doing now that I am back on a much smaller dosage of Effexor.
I AM doing better but she reserved the right to increase my dosage slowly and cautiously as we see how I progress.
My BP was down, now 130/80.
Much better than 160/110!!
I am also becoming less agitated and grumpy.
All good things.
I am having less issues regulating my body temperature and  I am having less issues regulating my bowels.
SO, things are getting better.
We also discussed the brain CT scan that was done a few months ago.
She was able to get the previous scans from my Virginia Beach Neurologist.
The comparison shows some deterioration, but not major deterioration.
The "Black Holes" are still there and increasing some.
Again, that is to be expected.
It was a production, informative, visit.
I am feeling better and I realize I was foolish to try to get completely off Effexor.
I promise I will never try to play Doctor again!
Trust me, the three months of misery taught me a valuable, painful, lesson!

I have been back on Effexor (37 mg) for three days.
The Brain Zapping has stopped.
That is a wonderful thing!!
I have not had my BP taken, so nothing to report there except my ears are not as clogged with pressure.
So, that is positive.
I still have headaches but not as severe and they go away if I lay down.
I am still grumpy during the day, but after I tale my Effexor at night, I get more mellow.
All positive so far.
I have an appointment with the Neurologist this Tuesday, so we will see what that brings.
More later.

As I wrote before, the grand experiment of stopping Effexor has come to an end, today.
I went through a controlled draw down of Effexor starting 14 May.
I was on 225 mg of Effexor, a very high dosage according to my Neurologist and what I have researched.
The plan was to reduce the dosage to zero over 3 weeks.
May 28 was my last day on Effexor.
The side effects of stopping this drug have been terrible as I have written.
Yes, I did regain my ability to express my emotions.
That's has been a good and bad issue.
I also regained my sexual functions.
But, the autonomic portion of my brain, which had been diagnosed as dysfunctional, went completely wacky.
My BP spiked in the second week of the draw down causing headaches, ear ringing, loss of hearing, and severe dizziness.
I also experienced difficulty regulating my body temperature.
So today, I took my first Effexor pill in 10 weeks.
I am on 37 mg, a far cry from 270 mg.
The goal is to return my BP and other Autonomic functions to as close to normal as possible.
If I have not written this before, Effexor has been found to have a positive impact on Autonomic Dysfunction.
That discovery was a surprise to my Neurologist and me.
My hope is that I will retain some emotional release and some sexual function along with regulating the Autonomic Dysfunctional issues.
Again, we will see.
I also hope the Brain Zapping will subside!
While it is less than the beginning of the draw down, it is still there, still intense, and still annoying.
So, the gran experiment is over.
I gave in or gave up.
I cannot defeat Effexor or live with the damage it caused me.
I wish I could tell the Neurologist that increased my dosage to the dangerous levels, what I think of him.
But, discretion may be the better part of valor.
I will lee you informed.

I was trying to go to sleep last night, and as always, I was reviewing my day, my month, and my life.
It came to me, that is is time that I stop fighting.
No, not Fist Fights, but that constant emotional, violent, interaction with people, things, environment, and events that make up life.
For instance, a couple of weeks ago, I got extremely upset with the local Subaru Dealer's Service Department.
And, I have had a running issue with the maintenance department here at Azalea Trace.
It came to me last night;  I am flailing against Windmills!
I cannot change anything or anyone.
So, why try.
And, since I have had some serious BP issues lately, the stress of fighting everything I used to think was wrong, unjust, or unfair, is not good for me.
For instance, today after Church, I went to the Nurses Station to get my BP monitored because I was dizzy along with all the other BP issues.
I cannot extend my life.
What I want to do is improve how I feel while I live!
Like I have said before, I am tired of feeling so bad!
So, I am going to try to let life proceed on it's own without my intervention.
I am just not going to fight anything, anymore.

My wife has had a summer project to organize 45 years of family photos!
She has worked very hard on this project and often chooses to work well into the night.
I understand she wants to get this project completed.
But, believe it or not, photo organizing can be very noisy!
And the noise is amplified as the night progresses.
She is up and down, tearing papers, opening and closing photo albums, in an increasing crescendo as the night progresses.
To accomplish this project, she required the television to be ON!
Not that she is watching it, but she likes the back ground noise.
Well, there are some commercials on the television that are very loud, with people screaming, that annoy me terribly.
With all the photo albums spread all over the couch coffee table, and floor, my wife cannot find the remote to mute the sound when these terribly annoying commercials attack me!
Get the picture?!
I realize, now that it is mid-morning, that it is Me that has the night issues and not her.
But, that does not help me at night.
More and more, I realize I need to be in Assisted Living/Memory Support for my sake and hers.
LBD is picking up steam!

<doc date=Wednesday, July 26, 2017>
Today, I decided to go back on an anti-depressant medicine.
The brain-zapping has decreased but nit stopped.
My blood pressure has not even began to go back to where it was before I went off Effexor.
My ear ringing has not decreased, and I am agitated and angry most of the time.
Hopefully, going back on an anti-depressant will help me back to what used to be normal.
As far as my BP, my research has revealed that Effexor does help with Autonomic Dysfunction, so maybe that issue will get better.
I also hope the brain-zapping and ear ringing goes away.
But, I mostly hope my anger and agitation go away.
Being difficult with my Wife is not good and not the way I want to be.
I sent an email to my Neurologist late this afternoon.
I am curious about her reply and drug of choice.
I gave her my preferences;  No weight gain, limited sexual dysfunction, some resemblance of emotional release, and as low a dose as can be effective.
We will see.
Soon, I hope.

Individuals with Dementia, especially Lewy Body Dementia, have perceptions that are not true or even based in a loose interpretation of the  facts.
I suffer from this.
It may be related to hallucinations.
I am not sure.
But, I know I have beliefs that come and go, that are not true, even though I think they are.
When do these perceptions occur?
Mostly at night, and especially when I am trying to go to sleep.
The perceptions cause my heart to race, my agitation to increase, and also cause me to get angry!
None of these are good for me.
or anyone around me.
One of the issues of perceptions I have written about before is loss or theft of our savings and money in checking.
Truthfully, I do not manage our finances or even understand them.
But, at times, I am sure someone has their hand in our cookie jar!!
Another perception I have is no one really cares about me!
This normally manifests itself as a feeling of being abandoned, unwanted, and as a burden to everyone around me.
During these times, I want to be alone, living away from everyone, and isolated socially.
This is strange for a person who once was a hyper extrovert!
But, it is a perception that overwhelms me every night and most times I lay down to take a nap.
I have this all consuming feeling of being useless, unwanted, a burden, and someone everyone want to be rid of!
This issue has put my wife under extreme stress, even though she tries to hide it.
I have not discussed these perceptions with her, but she sees them.
We have an appointment with my neurologist in two weeks.
My views  will leave there with some new anti-depressant drug to try.
I am clear enough to know being off the anti-depressant is not working!
I have tried to research some of the anti-depressants out there, but I have had no success.
I believe and even hope, that sooner, rather than later, I will be living in Assisted Living, alone, away from noise, screaming television commercials, and people.
But, because of policies here where we live, that will have to wait until January 2018.
And no, I don't think they give waivers.
Trust me, the later innings of this LBD game are brutal!!
And, a slough as I WAS,   I am no longer able to battle this foe.
I am defeated both mentally and physically.

My head is pressurized,  cannot regulate my body temperature, I have no idea what my BP is because I quit taking it weeks ago, but my hand and feet are freezing to the touch, My back hurts, I am having problem hearing because my ears are clogged, I ache all over, and I feel as bad as I have ever felt in my life.
Truly!
I did not feel this bad after my colon surgery!
I am also having increasing issues controlling bowel and urine.
I have had these issues in the past but they are increasing.
Emails with the neurologist have not been fruitful and my GP got her degree from a Cracker Jack Box!
Real medical care in Pensacola, or every south of Atlanta, west of Miami, and east of Houston, is nonexistent!
Not to mention, most doctors I deal with don't even believe or care that I am suffering.
Am I overstating things?
I don't think so.
After 6 years in this lost land, I have yet to find a doctor of any type that I would trust to lance a boil!
Honestly, I trust Navy Corpsmen more than I trust Doctors in the South!!
The unemotional truth is, I am getting worse.
The LBD is progressing and I am feeling the results of that progression.
Yesterday, our Grand Daughter in Law, who is an RN student came to visit.
I really love her and appreciate her attitude towards my disease.
She real cares about ma and asks probing questions to determine how I am doing.
It was great visit.
So, how this goes is anyone's guess.
I am going to contact the neurologist again and see if there is nothing we can do to help me feel better.
I do not feel confident this will succeed.
I just emerald my neurologist with all this info.
We will see what tomorrow brings.

Recently, I had our Subaru serviced.
I had it in my mind "Perceptions" that the service was not done correctly.
That "perception" has haunted me and upset me the last few days.
I even sent a rather "Hot" email to the service manager.
I tried to tie a nap today and my "perceptions" kept me awake and agitated.
So, I decided to open the hood and do my own inspection.
I found out I was wrong.
My "perceptions" were incorrect.
I sent the service manager an email apologizing for the portion of my complaint that I was wrong about.
The LBD issue her is, my mind manufactures issues that do not exist!
It is normal and expected, since I have done my research on LBD.
But, it is still very upsetting and completely impossible for me to control!
Only when I am in a phase of being as near normal and cognizant of reality as I get, can I reason out when I am wrong.
The question is, will I fall back into my "perceptions" as the evening becomes night?

Unless Jesus returns soon, and he may,  we will all face death.
That is, our passing from our earthly body to our Resurrection body.
The make up or that Resurrection body is determined by our relationship with Jesus Christ.
Think about that.
I do, often!
You either believe Jesus was the promised Messiah that died for our Sins and who's blood washes us clean.
If yo believe that, you will stand before God, represented by Jesus, the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords.
If you do not believe this, then you eternity will be torture.
Again, the time to decide what you believe is right now!
I have come to the point that many of the entertainers I liked have died.
I don't much like what they call entertainment today.
Most of my friends, family, and professional icons are dead!
My mentors, leaders, my friends, those who taught me, trained me, corrected me, and encouraged me are all gone, or almost all gone.
I miss them, their friendship, mentorship, and truthful, honest opinions.
I have very few people I can turn to for advice, guidance, strength, and friendship today.
I am a dinosaur.
Extinct, looked down on, treated with disrespect, misunderstood, even despised!
I have nothing of perceived value to add to the world, according to the folks I live around and the world I live in.
I have written about past friends that are gone;  Jim Smith, Bill Mowery, Vern Van Matre, Harold Wheeler, Kenny Colden, Joe Donnell, Dave Kelly, My Dad, Pete Schaffer, Sonny Mills, Harry Fresch, My Mom, and so many more that the emotions are overwhelming!!
Soon, I will see many of these folks.
How do I say that?
Since I stopped taking Effexor, my emotions have returned and also by perspective of the progression of my disease.
Effexor held me in a place of suspended emotional animation.
I was a Zombie.
But, now, along with the tears, comes reality.
I am OK with that.
Maybe even at ease with it.
I have sinned.
But Jesus has washed my sins away.
I have done some things of value and some foolish things.
But, only what I did for God will stand.
I am sure of that.
And I am glad of that also.
We recently went to the Seacrest Wolf Preserve n Florida with our youngest Grandson.
It was a surprise High School graduation gift.
We took the VIP tour and had over three hours ,just the three of us, alone in wolf families.
Many of the wolves came up for petting and some of them actually kissed us.
The wolves particularly liked my beard and liked to "Kiss" me.
While we were with the arctic wolves, the tour guide told us the Alpha Male would not come out to us.
He also said the Alpha Female probably would not make contact with us.
Well, the Alpha Female mauled me for attention.
She even laid on her back and let me rub her belly while she gently chewed my forearm.
The Alpha Male came close to me to watch the love fest.
The tour guide said I must have put off some "Positive Vibes".
The truth is, and I did not say it then, is;  Animal know when humans are sick, and maybe approaching the end of their earthly life.
I believe that is why I was treated so well by all of the wolves at Seacrest.
Again, it's OK with me.
I have had an exciting life.
Done things most men can only dream of.
I have had a wonderful Wife to share my best time with and a Son I am proud of.
The end of earthly life is the beginning of Heavenly life!!
I am ready!
Why do I write this?
It is part of my LBD journey and where my mind has been for awhile.
Thanks for sharing this with me.

<doc date=Thursday, July 13, 2017>
I have written before, may times, about being lonely.
I have no one to compare life's experiences with.
As a Navy Enlisted man, we call that telling "Sea Stories".
Now, as a primer to Sea Stories, I need to educate you that all Sea Stories begin with; "This ain't no shit"!
I talked with one of the few fellow retired enlisted men here, but he has nothing to talk about!
He never did anything, went anywhere, influenced anything or anyone, in his 20 year career.
What the Hell did he do?!
What a boring asshole!
I don't think he ever got drunk or hit anyone in fight!
My wife is tired of my sea stories, even though I have told her things I NEVER told her before!
Those things must have skilled my mind before now!
But, I have no one else to talk too.
This does not help with my mental issues related to my LBD and the terror of Effexor withdrawal.
Yes, I know I am flogging a dead horse!!
But, I am lonely, bored, and without mental stimulation.

<doc date=Tuesday, July 11, 2017>
Especially at night, I have emotional issues that are related to LBD and beginning to impact me more and more.
Doing my "Due Diligence" research about the emotional issues related to LBD.
For instance, I have beliefs, not feelings, but actual beliefs that an individual is taking our money.
Depleting our accounts.
Do I feel this way all the time.
no.
But especially in the evening and as I fall asleep, those beliefs take control of my thoughts.
There are other emotional issues that I cannot remember at this point.
Now, I will tell you, this is normal for Dementia patients.
So, I am normal.
It is a normal progression of my LBD and that keeps me from getting frightened by the symptom.
I believe knowledge is power over this disease.
The more we know about what is going to happen, the better prepared we are to face it.
Websites like LBD.ORG and others are great sources have documented symptoms of LBD.
Issues other LBD patients have dealt with.
We need to have those facts at our disposal!

Tomorrow is the 4th of July!!
A day that we used to grill with friends, tell Sea Stories, drink beer, and have fun.
Boy, do I miss those days!!
I miss my friends in the Norfolk area.
I miss the Navy connection.
I miss my Church friends there.
I miss being in Virginia.
Yes, Azalea Trace has a big indoor, holiday dinner tomorrow.
We will eat with some folks we are acquainted with.
I say it that way because I have never made any friends here in Florida or at this CCRC.
Since we are younger than most, there is no age connection.
And since Linda and I did not grow up rich, with servants, gardeners, and nannies, we have no connection there either.
And, since I am surrounded by Military Officers, mostly Reserves who never did anything, I have no Military connection.
I am alone, lonely, and with no hope of ever having a friend.
I told my Wife that one of my biggest frustrations is things are wrong in my life, and while I can identify them, I cannot do anything to change what is wrong!!
Life is much more difficult that I ever experienced before.
I miss my life!!
Maybe I am just difficult to get along with!

Yesterday, at the request of our Grand-Daughter In-Law, we went to the USS Alabama Memorial.
My Wife, Son, and Allie went to tour this great Battleship.
She wanted to get some idea of what I did for 40 years and the Alabama is a wonderful teaching tool.
I have not been on the Alabama for a couple of years and I was very excited to be "Home" on a Navy ship again.
Once aboard, I am young again!
My memories of being a Navy Gunner's Mate, a Master Chief, a Leader, a MAN, come alive.
I don't hurt!
I can run around the ship, bound up ladders, duck through hatches, and know exactly where I am on the ship, no matter what!!
People were following us and listening to my explanations of the systems on the ship.
I spent some time with young and older people, explaining al l the capabilities of the ship and her systems.
I was home!
I was young and alive again!!
Everyone else got worn out, but, at least in my mind, I could have gone on for hours more.
This may have been my last trip to the Alabama.
It was a good one.
</doc>
<doc date=Thursday, June 29, 2017>
As you know, I was a Master Chief Gunner's Mate in the United States Navy.
After that I was a Navy Civil Servant, first as a Tech Rep for Navy Gun Mounts and Turrets and later in management of technical assists for Search Radars and other electrons sensors.
I did many dangerous, exciting things that most men can only dream of.
Some things I did are features in movies and video games.
So what you say?
Well, in the beginning of my career, when I was a young Gunner's Mate, gun mounts frightened me!
Here I was in a large Navy Gun that fired 40 rounds a minute of 5" ammo, each round weighting 75 pounds, propelled by a powder tank weighing 44 pounds.
Again, 40 rounds per minute!!!
When things went bad, they went bad fast!!
I saw live, explosive projectiles have their nose fuze ripped off!
Propelling charges crushed and spilled all over the gun pocket.
Guns fail to fire with the gun barrel hot though to cook off the explosive charge!!
Then, a very good friend of mine was killed, during combat operations in Vietnam, in a MK 42 Gun Mount!
I had to make a decision then to continue my Navy career, without fear, or get out!
I stayed and I was never frightened of death on a Navy ship again.
Death on a Navy ship, would come swiftly, explosively, and quickly.
I knew that and that type of death does not cause eke fear of distress.
But, what I am facing now, is something I have not come to terms with.
When Red Mills was killed, everything became clear to me.
But, now, slowly dieting everyday, nothing is clear to me!!
Instead, like I was when I was a young Gunner's Mate on my first ship, I am frightened, unsure of myself, unsure elf the unknown.
My body is slowly dying and I know that.
My brain is deteriorating, loosing control of my bodily functions and emotional responses.
And it is the slow steady, unrelenting approach of death that is more frightening than the sudden death caused by combat or training.
I have no control of anything.
What I do will not change anything.
am being overwhelmed by Lewy Body Dementia and I hate it.
I hate it because I am afraid.
The unknown is always unnerving.
I believe this is an emotion I have not expressed before on this blog.
And, maybe never out loud either.
It does not help me to express these fears.
But it may explain my recent issues.

<doc date=Thursday, June 29, 2017>
Since I started the Effexor withdrawal, nights have been the most difficult time for me.
I have had some nights when I felt pretty good.
The electric zapping in my in brain was all but gone.
The pressurized feeling in my head had subsided also.
But, the last couple of nights, these issues have returned along with extreme depression and anxiety.
From what I have read, this is normal for those of us who choose to stop Effexor.
Some of what I have read, written by doctors and hospitals that know, tell me I may not succeed in this effort.
I would be devastated by that failure, even though it would not be totally my fault.
Effexor is a dangerous, powerful drug, that is extremely addictive.
It rewires the brain in ways science still does not understand!
Yet, they still prescribe it!
Last night I felt so bad that I was seriously considering going back on Effexor or another anti-depressant drug, to help me cope.
But, right now, I still have some fight left.
One of the side effects that made me want to get off Effexor was the lack of emotions.
Getting off of Effexor has given me back my emotions.
But, since I did not have any emotions for such a long time, how long I cannot remember, dealing with emotions anew, is a challenge.
Yesterday, a staff member of ACTS, made a comment that plucked a nerve in me.
That individual made a comment that "I should not be walking with a cane.
I looked too health to need a cane!"
Well, that fired me up and I flame sprayed that individual.
I asked that person where they got their medical degree at?
I asked them if they were licensed in Florida to practice neurology?
Yes, I was angry.
Two neurologists and a physical therapist recommended I use a cane.
Seems like a no brainer!!
But, that individual thought they knew better.
I bet that person never talks to me again.
The moral of this story is two fold.
First of all;  I am emotionally raw.
My experience with LBD and my view that I do not have long to live, has stripped me of social skills.
The second part of the story is, individuals that work with senior citizens should learn to keep their opinions in their pocket!!
Again, nights suck!!
My days have not been all that good either.
And maybe, where  I am in my LBD journey will make stopping Effexor or a drug like Effexor, is impossible!
Only time will tell.
And when I know, you will too.

<doc date=Tuesday, June 27, 2017>
When I was younger, and I went to bed, I  knew I was going to wake up in the morning!
I had plans, things I wanted and needed to do!
And don't tell me, you never felt that way because all of us did!
Now, when I go to bed, I have no assurance I will wake up in this world.
Truthfully, many times I hope I will NOT wake up in this world!
I now have no plans and nothing that I need to do.
Instead, all I can see is things and decisions that I messed up!!
Decisions I made wrong, things I wasted money  and time on, and people I hurt.
I see my sins and failures, not my accomplishments or successes!
As a matter of fact, based on the perspective I have now, I can't see anything I did of value.
Yes, hind sight IS 20/20!
It is always easier to judge what you did after it was done.
But, looking back at my life, I am not satisfied with my accomplishments.
I find no value in what I did in my life.
Why, because everything I stood for is being denigrated and trashed by the people I spent 40 years defending.
The people that I considered to be the slackers, the takers, the crooks, and the immoral ones are now touted as the "Greatest, Moral, Brave" ones!
Why did I spend countless years away from my family, doing what the leaders of America said I had to do, to be pissed on now!
Based on the conversations I have with the "Landed Gentry" I live around, I am worthless, never had any worth, and should not be allowed to exist, in America as they, the Landed Gentry, have engineered it to be.
I am also very concerned about the financial decisions I made concerning my Wife's future.
I hope we made the financially responsible decisions that ensure my Wife's financial security after I die.
Yes, ACTS has a program to meet the needs of residents that run out of money, if that was not their fault.
But, I still worry.
And that worry consumes me and robs me of any satisfaction in life.
Life is not as I thought it would be at this age.
I guess I was wrong about that too.

<doc date=Monday, June 26, 2017>
Well, it has been 7 or 8 weeks since I started the draw down from Effexor.
The side effects of doing away with Effexor have subsided somewhat.
The "Electric-zapping on my brain has diminished as well as the pressurized feeling.
I am more emotional that I was when I was on Effexor.
That is good, since I hated being a Zombie.
I do cry at the drop of a hat and for no apparent reason.
Not a big "JAG" of crying, but tears and emotional release just the same.
I now cry every time I think of the death of Marcel or Charrie!!
I miss both of them.
And, while on Effexor I was completely impotent, I am regaining sexual function again.
Another good thing.
(Although, my Wife might tell you I am a bit of a pest right now.)
But I am happy.
I am more introverted and more introspective than I was on Effexor.
I am sleeping well and I am not taking naps!
Those two may be connected, but I do not feel the need for a nap right now.
One thing that has surfaced in spades;  My unhappiness with living in Florida.
I have no Surface Navy friends and no Church friends.
I am as alone, socially, as if I lived in solitary confinement.
Yes, there are people her to talk to.
People I have nothing in common with, who have no respect for my life's experiences, and see no value in me because I was an Enlisted man.
I might as well be invisible.
I have stopped playing billiards because there is no fellowship there.
Socially, I would be much better in Virginia.
Long term care considerations make this the place I will stay.
But, I am not happy about that.
But, my happiness is not any one's concern.
Being a Effexor Zombie had it's benefits, but I like being connected to my emotions.
So, I will just have to find a way to deal with the negative issues.
Just the same, I am confident that I did the right thing getting rid of Effexor.
More later;

I have suffered for over seven weeks as I withdraw from Effexor.
That journey has been documented on this site and is well documented on the Internet with academic papers from MAYO Clinic.
The reason I decided to get off Effexor was some very negative side effects that made my life worse than life without the drug.
The truth is, we have no control over the length of our life.
God determined the length of our life before we were formed in our Mother's womb!
(Psalm 139)  But, we can have an impact on the quality of our life.
How, diet, exercise, following our Doctor's advice, not smoking, not abusing alcohol or drugs, and paying attention to our bodies reaction to the drugs we take!
Then, openly communicating the issues we face with our families and Doctors.
Every drug we take, has side effects.
Some are more important than others, but al side effects impact our quality of life.
For instance, I had a total emotional detachment while on Effexor.
Not emotional response to anything at all.
No tears, nothing!
I was also became completely impotent.
Now, after almost eight weeks of withdrawal issues, both of these sided effects are gone.
I am happy!
I would rather live well, enjoying life as it is presented to me, than be a zombie.
Yes, I suffer from some depression and yes, the withdrawal has been tough.
But, I am better off now and I have some other drugs I may try to delete from my treatment regimen also.
Of course, we will have to bounce those decisions off of my medical team.
Also, today was my MRI to determine if the brain damage from dementia has increased.
The Neurologist also wanted to see if I  had a stroke.
I am anxiously awaiting the results.
But now, I am going to relax and rest.
More later.

<doc date=Tuesday, June 20, 2017>
Recently, I have been a hot mess of negative emotions and anger.
Yes, there are reasons related to the progression of my LBD journey and the issues of withdrawal from Effexor.
That being said, there is no reason for me being as negative and mean as I have been on this blog and in my everyday life.
For this, I am sorry!!
Truthfully, I have just forgotten that Jesus walks with me and I am able to deal with anything in my life as long as I lean on Jesus!
I am human, and I just lost track of where I should be.
SO, I sincerely apologize to those of you who read this blog, the wonderful folks here at Azalea Trace, my Family, Friends, Shipmates and the poor strangers that have seen such a negative person.
I will say in my weak defense that this is a difficult journey that has increased in difficulty recently.
But, that truly is no excuse.
I trust the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords!
There is no other in Heaven or on Earth that I need to overcome anything in my life.
Jesus got my by the neck tonight and shook me!!
I am back on track, thanks to Jesus now, so I again plead for your forgiveness and I thank God for getting me back on track.
No matter what happens, I am Heaven bound!!
Praise God!

I have thought long and hard, or at least as long and hard as LBD will permit, about going back on Effexor.
Yes, I agree, stopping Effexor may have accelerated my LBD issues.
But that is a small price to pay for the misery Effexor caused me.
The side effects of Effexor are insidious.
But, after a long time on the drug, I realize I was an emotional zombie in every way!
No, I would rather live alone in a locked room than go back on Effexor.
And think about it;  I never heard anyone tell a Heroin addict to go back on Heroin!
And when I was a drunk, no one ever told me that I should not stop drinking.
Am I having issues.
Yes.
But some of these issues are being caused by self-centered, egotistical, morons that believe they are the only people with the ability to reason.
No thank you.
I will NEVER take an anti depressant again.
The rest of the world will just have to learn to deal with me.
Or, they can leave me alone.

I am totally unhappy living in Pensacola and at the CCRC I live in.
Yes, Azalea Trace is a wonderful, luxurious, high class facility.
Yes, I have family I love here in Pensacola.
But, I am not in an environment that meets my socialization needs.
Neither Pensacola or the CCRC I live in has people that I share anything in common with!
It is not their fault and I try not to think the are being jerks on purpose.
They are rich, college educated, silver spoon people that have never done anything close to what I have done.
They did not grow up poor.
They are not blue collar.
I clearly am!
My journey with LBD has caused me, in increasing amounts and occurrences, to talk, think, and even hallucinate about my Navy times.
My mind is comfortable with the 40 years of my Navy life.
Maybe even obsessed!
I have no one to discuss Navy times with.
No one that was a Ship owner, a Division Chief, who ever had a sea detail station, chipped paint, world 24 hours a day until they dropped to pass a material inspection, repair a gun mount, or shoot Naval Gun Fire Support to keep the Marines save in Beirut or other combat situations.
No one knows what a "Hot Gun, Foul Bore" is or how dangerous that is!!
Nobody cares that my friend GMG 1 Red Mills died in a gun mount explosion off the coast of Vietnam!
No one cares about me, what I did, or who I am.
But all of those thoughts, experienced, fantasies, hallucinations, and events are all that I think of!!
The problem is, what do I do?
Where do I go?
Is this the beginning of the end?
Do I push to move to Assisted or Memory Care now?
And WHY is any of this on my mind or even my problem?
Shouldn't these issues be someone else's responsibility?
If so, who do I turn too?
Look, I do not want to sound too dramatic, or even crazy, but I need help and I do not see any help on the horizon.
It seems irresponsible to leave me to make my own decisions when I think I am still in the Navy more times than not!
But the truth is, I do not live or operate in the present.
Ask anyone who real knows me.
Like Bo, John, or Jim, all men I play billiards with.
Or Rick, a retired Psychologist who's dog I walk sometimes.
Trust me, I am opening up more than ever before because, for the first time in a very long time, I am frightened!
This week, I intend to find a direction for the future.
If I can.
Two other points;  One, this week I threw in the towel on ever living in the Armed Forces Retirement Home in Gulfport Mississippi  (The Navy Home).
We are here at Azalea.
Linda cannot live in The Navy Home.
I MUST provide for her future.
So, that dream is dead.
Second;  I have not resigned myself to the reality that here is where I will remain until I die.
I will never live or have communion with Surface Navy Enlisted Men again.
Who I was has died.
But, who am I now.
Do I even exist anymore?
I believe I am an empty shell of my former self, with a video of my previous self playing 24/7/365 for anyone to see, if they were interested.
Which they are not.
LBD has taken over me.
Replace me with someone I do not know.
The old me lives in thoughts and sea stories, told to an empty room.
Last though for this post.
I do not even know who I CAN turn too.
I feel alone, lost, and disconnected from life.
Yes, I know my wife, son, grandsons, Allie, my middle Grandson's wife, my Best Friend Jerry and his wife, all care about me.
But, they do not see what I am going through.
They see what the wish I was or what I once was.
Maybe I hide my issues well.
I hate to disappoint them.
They love me and I love them.
But, I need help with the direction of my future.
There, over the last couple of hours,and through at least three editions,  I have told you in detail where I am.
Honestly, openly, and truthfully.
It hurts me to be open like this.
I have tears in my eyes as I am admitting my weakness, my fear, my inability to run my life, my frailty.
I am ashamed of the power LBD has over me.
But, it it what it is.
Lewy Body Dementia.
And "I still have miles to go before I sleep."

Yes, it is 12:30 here in Pensacola.
I took an nap tonight and then played pool.
When I went to sleep at 3 PM, I felt the effects of the Effexor withdrawal.
Extremely cold hands and feet.
headache, body pains, electric zapping in my head, and a pressurized head.
I woke up at 5:15 and it took me a while to get fully awake.
I went to play pool and when I cam home at 8 PM, I was starting to feel better.
We had some scrambled eggs and toast at about 9 PM and that really picked me up.
More and more, I feel a little better everyday.
It seems I have turned the corner on this Effexor withdrawal.
Yes, I sill have times everyday when I feel terrible.
But even the level of terrible is getting less.
But, I am having increasing times of feeling better, maybe even good.
I have written before that I read a paper on the Internet from MAYO Clinic that stated  the withdrawal from Effexor was worse than the withdrawal from Cocaine or Heroin!
I never used any illegal drugs.
But I did drink gallons of Bourbon and Beer and I can tell you I never felt this bad.
But, it seems the "hangover" is subsiding.
I remember times when I thought I was going to die.
That was replaced by the feeling that I was NOT going to die!!
Now I think I am going to live.

My withdrawal illness has brought about a burst of energy for my Wife to organize and sort decades of family photos.
Why, I am not sure since this has been on her list for a long time.
But, now, it seems to be the number one issue for her summer.
It may offer her an escape from my issues or it may be exactly what it is, an honest desire to get those photos identified and sorted.
Just the same, it keeps her busy and detached from my issues.
I believe that is good!
I have been doing some in-depth research about high blood pressure in LBD patients and autonomic dysfunction.
I cannot fine any connection between SSNRI withdrawal and high BP.
I have found some MAYO Clinic articles about Serotonin and autonomic dysfunction.
But, that was related to an increase in SSNRI drugs dosage not a decrease!!!
My next chase has been to see if SSNRI drugs help the autonomic portion of the brain control BP since my BP spiked after the Effexor drawdown.
But, the bottom line is, as I have stated before, I am a "lab rat".
Medical science has no earthly idea how any of the drugs prescribed for me have impacted me!!
Or, how the withdrawal will impact me in the future!
The truth is, my BP is somewhat better, but not back to normal and I am concerned it will never return to my 120/68 readings that I had before Effexor and the Effexor withdrawal.
Heck, I may not even live through this!
MAYO findings do connect autonomic dysfunction as it related to BP as an indicator of early death due to LBD.
We will see if my experiences track with MAYO's research.

We are approaching 350,000 views on this Blog!
It amazes me that you, the readers of my Blog, have found value in the things I have written about my journey with Lewy Body Dementia.
I knew from the beginning I was a "Lab Rat" and that my doctors were going to "Try" different things on me and do numerous tests to see what happened.
I have honestly, truthfully, and openly written about the effects of LBD on me and my family.
It has been an interesting and difficult journey.
But, it has been worthwhile because of those of you who read this Blog and reply to me about your journey or the journey of your loved one.
We are in this together and we can help each other through the trials and troubles of LBD.
I continue to write, even though it is difficult sometimes, because of you!!
Thanks!

One of our LBD family sent me a comment on loosing interest in things he used to love to do.
Now, he, like me, has lost interest in those activities.
It is somewhat unnerving in that things that once consumed our time, money, and our attention, are now little or no interest to us.
I loved shooting.
I was a big IDPA shooter and liked anything related to Defensive Pistol Shooting.
I was also active in the Friends of the NRA and Navy events.
I loved to cook out on the grill and have medium size groups over to enjoy time together.
Telling sea stories, discussing shooting disciplines, comparing trucks, all kept me involved.
Now, those things do not hold my interest.
Actually, few things hold my interest.
I do research LBD issues and Dementia issues in general including new trends in Dementia care.
But, that is about it.
I do not read, socialize, or play any games with the exception of 8-Ball once in a while.
Instead, I like solitude, quiet, and privacy.
I know other Dementia patients that have the same outlook, so while it is an issue we have to deal with, it is not something we should be concerned about.
Being introverted seems to be normal for those of us with Dementia in general.
On the other hand being alone all the time is not good for us.
We started a Dementia Support Group here at Azalea Trace that gives those of us with Dementia a weekly time to compare notes!!
I recommend all of us find a social out reach that meets our needs, based on where we are on our Dementia journey.
Thanks for the comments and inspiration!

One of the reasons I wanted off of Effexor was that I had no emotional outlet!
I could not cry!!
I was like a zombie!
Well, I have been completely off Effexor for two weeks and in the entire drawdown for 5 weeks.
And boy do I have emotions now.
I can cry at the drop of a hat!
And while I am glad to have some emotional release back, I hope it becomes more controllable in the near future.

<doc date=Friday, June 9, 2017>
I have discussed many of the issues I have suffered during my Effexor withdrawal.
I also talked about my hands being very cold.
Today we rode the community bus to the Commissary and when we returned, I was very dizzy and I was cold and sweaty at the same time.
The left side of my face felt thick and a little numb.
We took a 5 hour nap after we got home and I woke up feeling better.
But, during the nap, it came into my mind;  When do I feel bad enough to push the HELP button?
The thought of going to the Emergency Room late in the evening does not appeal to me.
Needless to say, I DID NOT push the HELP button.
And I do feel pretty good after eating dinner.
My hands are warmer, I am not dizzy, and the strange feelings on the left side of my face and body have dissipated for the most part.
Just the same, I will watch my progress through the night.
Just the same, I am improving as the withdrawal issues subside.
Tomorrow is the end of the second week without and Effexor after a three week draw down.
This has been very difficult on me and while I am sure getting off Effexor is right for me, I have have asked myself WHY I ever started taking Effexor and why in the world the FDA permits this drug to be sold!!
I have been told by neurologists that I am a "Lab Rat".
I have been prescribed drugs where the Doctor said;  We will see what this does.
And some times, we stopped the drug quickly because of the side effects.
Other drugs required numerous increases in dosage that brought on the side effects slowly and in an invidious manner.
Now, after the end of Effexor, I will be on drugs I know help me with limited, manageable side effects.
Hopefully, if I live through this Effexor withdrawal syndrome, I will be on a staid course.
We will see.

<doc date=Wednesday, June 7, 2017>
As you know, I went off Effexor in a Neurologist controlled withdrawal over 5 weeks ago.
The side effects of the withdrawal have been difficult at best.
The Brain Zapping, ear ringing, pressurized head, are all issues to be reckoned with.
But, there are some I am dealing with  I did not expect.
For instance, my Blood Pressure has gone up exponentially!!
Before I went off Effexor, my BP ran 120/68.
Now, it spikes at 162/110 and does not go lower that 140/80.
My cholesterol is 160 with a high "Good" HDL level and low bad cholesterol levels.
So, I do not believe that is the cause.
Instead, I believe it is a result of the increased Autonomic Dysfunction issues I have previously been DX with.
Another issue is the fact that Effexor med it so I had no emotional release.
Now, I have emotional reactions to any and every event.
And those emotions may be hyper elevated.
This is something I need to watch.
The Neurologist ordered some blood work to check for a stroke and had set up an MRI for the end of June, to check on the progression of my LBD and to check for strokes.
We will see what we will see.
One other topic;  I have done some research on the Internet about SSRI drugs.
Cleveland Clinic, Mayo Clinic, and others medical brain trusts have nothing but bad things to say about the side effects of SSRI drugs.
Yes, they help with depression and some people really need them.
I venture to say SSRI's give these folks better lives.
But, it was also evident to me that the SSRI class of drugs was over prescribed.
And since, Mayo now says getting off an SSRI is worse than the withdrawal from Cocaine and Heroine!!
In my case, I believe I was prescribes Effexor in effort or at least, had my prescription increased in error.
In any case, I am now dealing with the consequences of this drug and those issues may kill me!!
Oh well, I always knew I was a lab rat.

Today makes one week since I have been TOTALLY OFF Effexor.
I am improving and the withdrawal symptoms are decreasing.
I still have ringing in my ears but it is not as loud as it was.
I can actually hear my Wife speak.
I still am experiencing the "Electric Zapping" at night.
But again, it is not as intense as it was even a week ago.
I am still grouchy, especially at night.
And the loud screaming, asinine commercials on Television drive me to distraction!
Why they believe screaming at me will cause me to spend money, is lost on me.
I also still have issues with my social filters.
If  am aggravated by something I hate, everyone in a 10 square mile radius will know it!!
Tomorrow I have an appointment with my Psychologist,  That will be interesting!!
I bet he learns something about Effexor withdrawal!
The MRI is scheduled for 21 June.
Nothing happens fast in East Lower Alabama!
While I know I am suffering from agitation, some depression, and anger,  I still know getting off Effexor is the right decision!

Since I began the draw down of Effexor I have had numerous issues that are well documented on the Internet.
Electric Zaps in my brain, loud ringing in my ears, and head pressure have been the most prevalent issues and all of these are subsiding.
However, my Blood Pressure has gone way up.
162/102 was the highest recorded readings and it has not gone down much.
My Neurologist got me in quickly and my BP was still high, around 150/94.
A month ago it was 118/68 in my GP's office.
She believes it is related to the Effexor draw down.
She did a thorough exam and showed concern over my stability issues that have been progressing even before we decided to get off of Effexor.
She decided to order another MRI, to see if I may have suffered a small Stroke and to check on the Black spots and White spots in my previous MRI's.
I worked with a fellow in the Navy that used to say; "I don't know what's happening, but it is happening fast!"
He may have been right, related to my LBD journey.
So, next week, I will have another MRI and then I will await the results.
I am curious about the Black and White spots.
We will see what we will see.
More later.

Today is the third day I have been totally without any Effexor.
This is the day, according to my Internet research, that my system is free of any of the drugs that make up Effexor.
From what I have read, quitting Effexor and the withdrawal from that drug, is worse that the withdrawal from Heroine and Cocaine!
In any case, this morning, my blood pressure spiked.
It was 160/102.
The nurses took it manually not with the BP machine!!
They took it again three hours later and it was 158/94.
About four weeks ago, in my GP's office it was 120/68.
Now, we know LBD impacts the Autonomic portion of the brain.
Along with my increased BP, I was cold as an ice cube!
My skin was very cold to the touch, even the Nurse Practitioner commented on it.
She told me to go relax and I took a nap.
I woke up at 5 PM and felt better, although I have not had my BP checked since 1:30 PM..  After the 1:30 PM check, I had my wife call the Neurologist's office and ask for an appointment.
They fit me in tomorrow at 2 PM.
That indicates to me  they are concerned also.
We will see what comes from that, but one thing is for sure, I WILL NOT EVER take an anti-depressant!
Since I got up at 5 PM, I do feel better,  The ringing in my ears is now only in my left ear.
I still have a slight headache, but I have refused to take anything for the pain, since the beginning of the drawdown!
I just looked over this post and I realized, while I have written it in one sitting, it is very disconnected.
That is how my brain is working and that makes sense since Effexor rewires the brain and the withdrawal process tries to put the wires back on the original posts!!
A tough process, as I can testify.
I will keep you informed of the process in hopes that other can learn from my misery.
</doc>
<doc date=Monday, May 29, 2017>
I was feeling physically and mentally bad for quite some time.
Recently I decided to ask my Neurologist to get me off of Effexor.
I had become convinced that Effexor was no longer benefiting me.
I knew the withdrawal would be difficult, but that was an understatement.
As we started the decrease in the dosage from 225 mg, to 150 mg, to 75 mg, and now to zero, my issues have increased.
Now, I have been without Effexor for two days.
The headaches and head pressurization, whack became terrible when I coughed, sneezed, or tried to blow my nose, have passed.
I still suffer, (and suffer is the correct word)  from numerous Electric Zaps in my brain and ears that sound like gun shots!!
I also have extremely LOUD ringing in my ears.
Now, my ears have had ringing since I was on the USS Mullinnix  (DD 944) in 1969!!
But this makes it difficult for me to hear.
Since the Internet says all of the Effexor will be out of my system Wednesday night, I have hopes these issues will pass.
In a nutshell, I am in misery.
Add to that misery the fact that we have been busy with the High School graduation of our youngest Grandson and the departure of our middle grandson to Boot Camp, and some responsibilities here at Azalea Trace, and you can see that I have not been able to hibernate like I would like.
I think, based on my personal experience and research, that Effexor is  a adequate drug to treat depression in the beginning.
But, like all SSRI drugs, it requires increases in dosage.
And at some point, looses it's effectiveness.
Getting off Effexor is a long, painful process that has not yet subsided.
I pray I will start getting back to something that feels like "Normal" soon!

For those of us who have any form of Dementia, in my case LBD, how others react to us has an impact on the Dementia patients emotional stability!
Trust me, it is true.
Now, what do I mean.
From diagnosis to death, our cognitive and mental abilities change.
Some individuals progress quickly, but most of us progress in spits and spurts.
The challenge is to understand where the Dementia patient is cognitively and physically, and then fit your response to where the individual is.
I realize this is difficult for you who deal with us.
But, not paying attention to our condition causes us, the Dementia patient, further frustration!!
I have a Grand Daughter in Law that pays particular attention to my progress.
Of course, she is in Nursing School so she has a good insight into my disease.
The bottom line is, you cannot expect me, or any other Dementia patient to do what they used to do, regardless of how good you think they are doing.
We do not function like we used too or how we would like to!
We will try to meet your expectations, probably to our own detriment, until we are so bad we cannot do anything.
There comes a time when the Dementia patient, including me, run up against their disease and finally stop trying to meet the expectations of others and succumb to the ravings of our disease.
When that time comes, and it has, we need your respect, help, and understanding.
These are not pity.
The simply are the way to help us be part of life while dealing with our disease.

OK, I admit that the withdrawal form Effexor is difficult.
And going to sleep is very difficult and I have had to stay up latter than I want to, to get completely exhausted so I can finally go to sleep.
And during that awake time, m mind wanders back through my life.
The things I spent the majority of my life doing, and how useless it all seems to be to the world, my fellow citizens, and the people I live with.
Yes, when I was living the life of a career Enlisted man was exciting, dangerous, wild, and crazy.
And, all of us who served together through the Cold War, Vietnam, Lebanon, Libya, Central America, Iran/Iraq War, and various other then Classified operations believed that what we were doing was important.
Now, I am not sure my 66 years were well spent.
The prospect of death changes one's view of their life.
At least it has mine.
No one really, truly cares, or is interested in what I did.
The people I live with don't even believe I am telling the truth when I try to explain what I did.
To them, if I did not fly a fighter, I was nothing but a low priced enlisted slave.
What I did  had no value.
To be discarded is the worst fate of all.

<doc date=Thursday, May 25, 2017>
The community I live in is a wonderful, luxurious, community.
I have written about this before.
But, the vast majority of the people that live here are over 80.
The community caters to people of that generation.
Nothing in the way of entertainment, eating venues, or care are modern, up to date, or state of the art.
There is an expansion of the Assisted Living and Skilled Care areas that is planned to start this year.
But, the first shovel of dirt has not been turned and it is almost June.
And while the plan for the extensions of these communities has a publicized Memory Support community, there is no information about these units or when they will be available.
With new Memory Support communities opening in Pensacola, I wonder if we made the right decision, based on the attitude here.
The present community has little capability to deal with Dementia patients.
My efforts to start a Memory Support group for those of us with Dementia was originally met with a brick wall from management and the nursing staff.
Persistence got the group started and now we are getting marginal, cursory support from management and the nursing staff.
But there is still NO publicity in any calendar or in the comment news ether about the group's meetings.
Another issues is, since the average age is so high and so many of these folks still cling to Independent Living Apartments, there is little opportunity for younger Seniors to move in.
Many of these folks employ personal aids to take care of them in Independent Living apartments.
Sort of a personal, assisted living community!
That coupled with the fact that Azalea Trace is knows as a "Nursing Home" instead of a CCRC, does not help with the recruiting of younger residents.
But the "Nursing Home" reputation is well earned and deserved.
For instance, many people that live in Independent Living apartments cannot walk down stairs, use rotators or electric carts to move around, and if a FIRE broke out on a floor above the first floor, would be TRAPPED in their apartments, doomed to die.
Another issue for me is, the over 80 club that runs this place is also a bunch of retired Military Officers, most of which were reserves that never did anything, and all of them think Enlisted Personnel are personal servants who have no value and did nothing but scrub pots and clean toilets.
Trust me, you can't swing a Cat and not hit an O-6 around here!
(And I bet you do not know what the phrase "Swing a Cat" means!
No one here does, trust me.)
Maybe I am just having a difficult day.
I do have friends here, but no one that I am considered equal too.
I am always the "Burdened" individual in any conversation or situation.
I do many things to help the community including filling in for the Staff Chaplain for services and last year the Christmas Program.
Again, maybe this will pass, when I am 80!
The truth be told, I will be surprised if I make it to 67.

I have been in the process of getting off Effexor.
I have taken Effexor for a long time.
How long, I cannot say.
I was taking 225mg every evening.
But, recently, I decided it was not helping, and since I am on a charge to get rid of any drugs that do not work, out it goes!
However, I have discovered that getting OFF of Effexor is much more difficult than getting ON Effexor!
The Neurologist, gave me a plan t taper off of the drug.
I dropped to 150mg for a week, and now 75mg for a week, and then NONE!
The first ten days was TERRIBLE!!
The withdrawal symptoms included a pressurized feeling in my head that was horrific.
But today is the 11 day of the draw down and I feel almost normal!
I have more energy and I have some zip in my step.
I do not see any increase in my depression so my estimation that the drug was not doing me any good may have been correct.
We will save the final verdict until I am completely off of Effexor for a week.
Do anti-depression drugs work?
I think so and some people need them.
I may have needed them in the beginning, but I do not want to take them anymore.
I do have a prescription for a different anti-depressant if I need it, but my hope are that I can stay away from that type of drug.
We will see.

I have started  two or three posts, only to delete them because I CANNOT express myself.
Things start out fine, and then, I am at a loss for words.
I was trying to go to sleep tonight, but I wanted to post this, to let you know why I a experiencing.
I am down to one Effexor 75mg, starting today and things are going moderately well.
The first week was the most difficult.
That was the week I went from three 75mg pills to two.
But, again, my memory of this entire process is fuzzy.
I have only been on this draw down one week!
I am confused.
The last week seemed like two weeks.
So, I guess the first part of the week was bad and the end of the month was better.
Tonight was the first one pill night.
We will see how this goes.
When I try to go to sleep, I get more agitated and more negative in my thoughts.
This is probably related to my med changes.
We will see.
On a positive note, I was blessed with the opportunity to perform the marriage of our Middle Grandson and his beautiful new Wife.
The remind Linda and I of us when we were first married.
It was a wonderful ceremony and reception and although I was very tired after the event, I was very happy I could be there and perform the marriage.
Again, it was a blessing for me.
Our youngest Grandson graduates from High School this week.
Another blessing.
I did some research and the National Institute of Health has a wonderful pamphlet on Lewy Body Dementia.
It is free and can be ordered online from NIH.
They have others relating to Dementia that also have value to the LBD caregiver.
Check them out.
I also did some research on my issues caused by the impact of LBD on the Autonomic portion of my brain.
I have mentioned before that I have had sexual performance issues.
I am now completely impotent.
Nothing works!
And it is because of the autonomic issues related to LBD.
It does not make me feel better about this issue, but it does help me understand it better.
I ma also having increasing difficulties swelling.
I choke and cough often after swallowing any liquid.
This is an autonomic issue too, along with my issues with fluctuating BP and body temperature.
All signs this disease is getting worse.
There, I did it.
Not pretty, not connected, but you know what I am going through.
That was always my goal.
More later.

I believe I posted about stopping Clonozipan.
I did that without consulting my Neurologist.
Since I was on that drug for such a short time, I felt comfortable with that and the doctor knows now and agreed with our reasoning.
I also wanted to get off of Effexor.
The neurologist has agreed to that move and gave me a plan to slowly get off of it.
I have been on Effexor for a long time and it has stopped working if it ever worked at all.
I am on a quest to delete any drugs from my treatment that we believe, do not help me.
I see no reason to take drugs that have serious side effects,  if they do not help me.
The Neurologist cautioned us that getting off Effexor may have it's own side effects.
Like more memory loss!
Also, more night agitation and increased anger issues!
Linda will have to keep track of my progress and the Neurologist told her to call if I have any negative changes.
We will see.

This morning, I woke up thinking about a Navy Shipmate named Robert "Red" Mills.
He and I went to MK 42 "C" School at Great Lakes in 1970-71.
He was a First Class Gunner's Mate who worked ASROC all his career and I was a GMG3 who worked MK 42 gun mounts for two years.
He was the Class Leader and he took me under his wing.
We watched Monday Night Football with his family in the "Flintstone" Navy Housing at SSC Great Lakes.
They had one of those "Dime Store" turtles that survived!!
That turtle was HUGE!!
In any case, when we graduated he went to the USS Stoddart (DDG 22) and I went to the USS Stein (DE 1065).
Red was killed during Combat Actions against the North Vietnamese in 1972.
They had a Misfire, Foul Bore, that they had difficulty clearing and the ammunition cooked off in the gun bore, 22 minutes into the foul bore declaration, killing Red and another three other men.
His death overwhelmed me then and still haunts me today.
Red died 45 years ago!
Yet now, I cannot get Red out of my mind.
As a career Gunner's Mate, I had a number of "Foul Bore" situations that should have ended the same way!
Only God knows why they did not.
I found Red's name on the Virtual Vietnam Wall and some comments left on the names of the other three that died because of that incident.
But now, at the end of my life, the circumstances of Red's death are forefront in my mind.
Why, I do not know.
Maybe I will see Red in Heaven.

I have not posted since Marcel's passing.
I miss him, tell him it's time to go to bed, and have seen him walking around the apartment a number of times.
His death has impacted me and possibly impacted the progression of my LBD.
Why do I say that?
I wrote about the addition of Clonizapan.
I do not remember how long I took it before the positive effects of the medicine decreased.
But, I then called the Neurologist and asked for an increase in the amount of the drug.
She doubled it and it helped for a couple of days and then stopped working all together.
So, I stopped taking it about 8 days ago.
Coupled with this, I have become more emotional, agitated, and angry.
I stay in our apartment the vast majority of the time and do not socialize very much at all.
I do enjoy watching the squirrels and birds outside of our patio doors.
It is the best show for me to watch.
However, it stops at dusk.
I had a difficult birthday as things did not turn out like we had planned.
So, we stayed in and did nothing.
That depressed me even more.
I have talked to my Wife about these issues, and also have opened up about some issues that have impacted me from my past.
Talking "Navy" is one thing that unwinds me.
But issues that date all the way back to my birth still haunt me.
The bottom line is, I am NOT doing well at all.
The LBD has progressed.
Even my stability walking has gotten worse.
These issues have caused us to cancel our trip back to Virginia since riding in the car is a big agitation for me also!!
I have always said I will continue to write this Blog until I can no longer do it.
And I will, but I believe I will be posting less, just because I have difficulty expressing what is happening inside of my brain.
More as I can..

Marcel Dolence, Miniature Poodle, 14 hers old in Human years, passed away today, 22 April 2017, In Pensacola Florida.
He was a long time resident of Virginia Beach Virginia.
He was born in the finger Lakes Region of New York.
I lost my best friend today.
He was my Velcro puppy, always by my side, always loving, and always forgiving of my foibles.
Marcel and I fell in love when I first met him.
He was a small puppy my Son and Daughter in Law had just adopted and he and I were made for each other.
I loved him!!
From the first time I saw Him, I wanted him tone my puppy and he wanted to be my friend!
I will always love him.
As he aged, he had some serious health issues.
A seizure about 5 years ago that lead to the discovery of Hypothyroidism.
Later, a heart murmur that required medication and continued to get worse.
He lost most of his hair due to the Hypothyroidism in the last year and he had many bumps, boils, and hot spots.
Yet, he was always gentle, loving, and calm.
Marcel could not stand to be away from me.
Last year, we took a trip without him and he nearly died!
He looked like he was on his last legs when we got home.
We went to the Vet, nursed him back to health, and had a good last year together.
Marcel even let a homeless, elderly, miniature poodle invade his home.
Cherie was sickly and neglected but he befriended her, shared me with her, and she had three years of relatively good health before we needed to have her put down at 15 1/2 .
Marcel missed her and grieved for Cherie until the day he died, today.
I love Marcel and He will always be in my heart.
When I die, his cremains will be placed in my coffin.
I will always miss him.

I have read extensively on the topic of caring for a dementia patient.
Most of what I read is directed at the drugs available for the patient to slow down the progression of the disease and calm the patient.
There are also extensive writings on what drugs NOT to give to those of us with LBD.
All of this research is very valuable and worthwhile.
But, none of it addresses the patients need, hunger, and desperation to be intimately touched by the ones he or she loves.
Hugging, kissing, sitting close holding hands, cuddling in bed help calm the dementia patient and make him or her feel loved, important, and wanted.
Even listening to a story told many times by thee patient give that person self worth.
Putting it personally, there is little I can do to show my usefulness to how worthwhile I am.
I cannot work, drive, even perform sexually anymore.
As kiss, hug, closeness in bed or on the sofa bring back times of intimate relationships.
Times of love and vibrancy, Instead, we are left alone in our lift chair, or taking a nap alone, while the spouse continues his or her active, normal life.
The patient is an after thought or worse, a burden.
Who is going to sit wit Him while I go out to play?
Kenny Rodger's song "Ruby, don't take your love to town"  illustrates the emotions and frustrations of the handicapped individual.
Please don't replace us with activities that you could do after we pass!
I have seen this happen to many times.
Now, when the Dementia has progressed to the point where the patient is only a shell of his or herself, shorter visits, less in-depth conversations, and fewer memory exercises may be warranted  But that Dementia patient, no matter war stage their Dementia is in, needs, requires, and searches out that intimate connection from humans and predominately from the Human they love!
Do care givers need a break?
Certainly.
Is respite care valuable and necessary?
Yes.
But doing your thing while the patient wastes away in the chair is not care giving,  It is torture, for the patient.
I know I have little or no value.
But, telling me by you actions and interest that do not relate to me only make me feel more worthless and tell me you really do not care anymore.
When we realize that is the case, Dementia patients tend to sit down and retract into their cocoon.
They sleep more, eat less, participate less in any activities, and refuse to do things they once enjoyed,  Why, because they were told they are now useless, unwanted, and even repulsive.
As  progress I see these things occurring in my life and impacting me more and more.
There truly is nothing I enjoy to do.
My worth is that of a little child.
Sit there, don't tough anything, be quite, and don't embarrass me.
PS:  One more important point.
Dementia, no matter what type is a death sentence.
We are dieing because our brain is failing,  We may mentally die before our body quite.
But we are going quick.
Drugs slow the progression of the cognitive decking, sometimes!
But, death is just around the corner just the same.
That kiss, hug, special whisper in the ear may be the last one your Dementia patient hears.
I encourage you to think about your relationship with your special Dementia patient.
How do you treat and interact with him or her.
Put yourself mentally, in their position, an then see if you would like the treatment.
It could be an eye opener.

I realize the nature of LBD causes me to complain.
I am sorry, but there are plenty of issues that give me a reason to complain.
Just the same, I have had a very good run the first half my LBD journey.
Thanks to a great Neurologist, Dr. Mary Alliston Bowles, in Norfolk Virginia, I have been on Razadyne and Namenda and depression meds that have slowed the progress of this "always advancing" disease.
Recently, those drugs have started to loose their battle with the progression of my LBD and I have experienced more issues, as I have reported.
My Neurologist here in Pensacola, Dr. James King, and his Nurse Practitioner, Lacy Hilton, have increased my dosage of Clonizipan and that has calmed me down at night.
So, I am now more relaxed and calm at night and I can go to sleep easily and sat asleep.
I am sure this will require continuous increases to continue the positive effect.
I accept that.
I have become very reflective, and I realize my life has been pretty good.
It started out in poverty, as a throw away unwanted child.
But, because of the love of two wonderful people, Addison and Evelyn Mills, I was raised well and given great moral values.
School was not my style but the United States Navy fit me to a "T"!
That "Dream Career" lasted 40 years!
MY other Dream has been my wife, Linda.
An intelligent person who shows Christ's Love in everything she does.
God used Her to guide me to Jesus Christ and then to make me usable to God in Children's Ministry and as an Associate Pastor.
Now, we live at Azalea Trace, my third career, truthfully.
I have the opportunity to help the Staff Chaplain and we have established a Memory Support Group to help other Dementia patients.
This group keeps me in a positive state of mind.
So, as my mind diminishes and my physical capabilities decrease, I still find happiness helping others and in turn, being helped by them.
I try to present a Positive Attitude to everyone I meet in the hallways or in the dinning room.
Because, I know each of them have their own physical and cognitive issues.
We are a family here at Azalea Trace.
So, I apologize for being so negative and complaining.
There are reasons and excuses, but they are not as important as me making every effort to be thankful to God for the wonderful life I have had.
I have NO FEAR of death and I am sure it is closer than ever before.
Even closer than it was when I was a Navy Gunner's Mate.
And I am totally at ease and comfortable with God's next planned step in my life.
As a matter of fact, I look forward to it and embrace it!
Life has been very good.
Praise God!

I grew up with older parents.
I was about 3,  4 , or 5 when Mom went through Menopause.
I did not understand her emotional distress and in 1954, there were no medicines to help.
Additionally, they had no money to go to the Doctor for help.
So, I got yelled at a lot, saw her cry a lot, and learned that things I said, and the manner or way I said them, often caused GIGANTIC issues, for me!
My Dad, worked extra hours and player pool!
He found distance was a good defense.
Me, I had none.
Then, as a Husband, I went through Menopause with my Wife.
I had more experience and more education that my Dad did.
Just the same, many times, no matter how hard I tried, I failed and came out as the villain, no matter what I did.
It seemed, no matter what I did, how well I planned, how well I did, what accomplishments I achieved, I was a dirty no good!!!
I was defenseless again!
It seems, some of my Wife's Menopause issues have resurfaced in recent years, most likely from the stress of being my caregiver and the worry of facing my early death.
I am sure, she always thought I would be her, healthy, capable of anything, bullet proof, do it all man like I was when I was 30!
So, I can assign little fault to Her for her emotional explosions that seem to come from no where and have no rational basis.
But those emotional explosions from my Wife cut me to the quick, when I am trying my best to be helpful around the home, friendly to people, and do my best to Serve God here at Azalea Trace.
I make every effort to hold my emotions in, so that I do not upset her,  Again, I know she has a full plate.
But, I need some consideration too.
Or, maybe that is just too much to expect.
In any case, It has been a difficult day for me from 30 minutes after we got up until now, when I go to bed.
This goes back to post I wrote a while ago.
Maybe the Patient and the Caregiver should NOT live together.
Maybe the patient living in Assisted Living makes sense.
What I do know is, I am tired of doing everything and having none of it meet the satisfaction of my wife.
Obviously, more night time drugs are needed!

Six months ago, we started a "Dementia Patients Support Group" here at Azalea Trace.
We meet every week for an hour and help each other deal with our individual Dementia Journeys.
Tonight, the Nurse Practitioner at my Neurologist's Office, Lacy Hilton, had dinner with those of us in the Dementia Patent's Support Group.
We had all the members of the group, their spouses, and the Nurse Practitioner from Azalea Trace, Missy Clements, in attendance.
It was a wonderful meal and time of fellowship.
But the information Lacy provided was the best part of the evening.
After she gave us an update on the latest research in Dementia care, Lacy answered questions and interacted, personally, with each member of the group.
Her factual approach and reassuring nature helped each member of our group feel at ease and open.
Having The Sacred Heart Neurological Group ready to interact with Dementia patients and their care givers is a blessing to all of us.
Future meetings are planned and more outreach is needed here at Azalea Trace and through the country.
People need to understand Dementia, not run from it.
Again, I thank the medical team and Administration here at Azalea Trace for setting the stage for this type of personal education program and Lacy Hilton for starting what will become the model for other retirement communities to follow!
It was a Great night!

People with LBD normally deal with Hallucinations.
It is a normal symptom of this disease.
I have had Hallucinations, off and on, since the beginning.
I have seen horses in my back yard, men crossing the freeway in heavy traffic, cars ready to hit us, all sorts of animals around me, and recently a man poking in our patio window.
I have also experienced vocal Hallucinations where I hear voices that I recognize and do not recognize, calling my name or asking me questions.
Additionally, I still experience touch Hallucinations where I feel someone or something walking on me in the bed or someone touching y shoulder to back when I am alone in the bed.
Some of these have been frightening and some not.
I have recently been startled by men I see, approaching me, when I am walking the dog in the day or the evening.
That is probably because of the progression of the disease.
I know other LBD patients that have similar Hallucinations.
Again, some frightening and some just things they see.
The truth is, LBD is a disease that has Ups and Downs and Hallucinations are part of that.
It is not abnormal for a person's Hallucinations to stop for a while and then return with a vengeance!
These occurrences are normal!
So, try to deal with them like the other issues of our disease.
I understand it is difficult, especially if your Hallucinations are unnerving or frightening.
I actually have had a Hallucination that scared me so much, I made a special appointment with my Psychologist to discuss it.
I have recommended before having a complete "Team" for your care including a Psychologist.
This is a disease that requires a complete team approach.
Trying to understand your experiences with LBD with only a GP or Neurologist is handicapping yourself, in my opinion.
Yes, I understand there are financial limitations, but if you can, build a team.
Hang in there.
Try to find a support group in your area.
Look into the local Alzheimer's Association, a local hospital, or even a local College or University, for a support group.
The more support you have, the better your journey and the easier your family will be able to deal with the disease also.
Again, this is my advice based on my journey, so far.
I am not a medical professional of any type.  
</doc>
<doc date=Monday, March 27, 2017>
Earlier in my journey, I had an event where, I was sure then and I am still sure, that I was followed by a family member when I went out for a while to get a sandwich.
This morning, I was very bothered by something similar that I cannot remember.
Sounds strange, I know.
I was up before my wife and I was very agitated and upset over this, now unknown, issue.
Now I am very  upset by the issue and the fact I cannot remember what it is!!
I am also becoming more curt with people and I reply to people in a manner that is unfiltered and without respect to their feelings some times.
These issues are not constant but they are not announced either.
I do not know she they are going to occur!
This, coupled with an increase in very realistic hallucinations has caused me to realize things are getting worse.
I absolutely must stay in our apartment until February of 2018 to keep the monthly rate we have now.
The LBD journey is getting more difficult and the decline is steeper.
I guess I will just have to get tougher.
</doc>
<doc date=Sunday, March 26, 2017>
I discussed my anger over the comments of people on my journey with LBD with my Psychologist last Monday .
You know, the comments those self-proclaimed neurologists that work other jobs that tell us we are faking.
In any case my Neurologist tried to tell me those comments were actually "COMPLIMENTS" I can see that.
It is like telling some very overweight woman; "You don't sweat bad for a Fat girl!"
Compliment my butt!
The people that tell me I look "normal" are telling me I am faking my disease like some "Welfare Queen".
You are lying to get money from the government!
You are faking to get sympathy!
You are pretending to have a disease they really cannot diagnose so you don't have to work.
Let me state, that I disagree with my Psychologist, completely!
And that I think he had a FAKE Phd diploma from a Cracker Jack box.
There, I feel better.
Anyone want pancakes?

I know a man where we live that visits his wife, who has advanced Alzheimer's, every day.
He talks to her and tells her of the news, family happenings and the things he has done that day, to keep her informed of the life she is missing.
For three years, she has not talked, reacted to anything he said, his touch, kisses on the cheek, or even loud thunder and lightening!
She has her eyes open, but responds to nothing!
A few weeks ago, he planned a Birthday Party for her.
All of their children and grandchildren we in attendance.
There was a custom made Birthday cake and the party room in Skilled Care was decorated for a BIG Birthday Celebration.
He and the nursing staff moved his Wife into a wheel chair.
Before he pushed he into the decorated room for the surprise party, he told her; 'Happy Birthday Sweetheart!"
When they entered the room, to the family shouting "Happy Birthday Mom, Grandma, Great Grandma"  His wife, who has shown no voluntary movement or response to any stimuli for three years reached out for her husband's hand and squeezed it!!
My friend broke down and cried!
He told me later, "I never say anything in her presence that I do not want her to hear.
I always knew she was still there!"
That hand squeeze was worth everything to Him and Her!!
This is a good lesson in how to interact with those of us who have dementia.
We are still here.

<doc date=Sunday, March 19, 2017>
Those two statements send me into a rage!
If you have read my other posts, you already know that.
Today, we came home from Church and ate Lunch in the dinning room of Azalea Trace.
A wonderful meal, like all of them here.
We ate with a couple that we know and the woman is a leader in a Bible Study that my Wife is also a leader.
We are friends with them, have eaten with them before, and helped them with problems.
The husband asked me about my disease and how I was diagnosed.
I am very open about my journey.
I will openly, truthfully, describe everything that I have experienced to anyone interested.
And I answered his questions.
Then, after lunch, we split up, and I went to our apartment to let Marcel the Wonder Dog out, before his bladder broke.
My Wife was sidelined by the Wife of the man who questioned me about my LBD.
She said;  Your Husband does not look or act sick.
He shows no signs of dementia!
I have been told that by other folks here.
And truthfully, it is getting old and very difficult to deal with in a polite manner.
What actually, does a Mid-Term Dementia patient look like?
I drool, pee my pants, I have very thin skin that bleeds easily, scabs slowly, and refuses to heal.
I am unstable in my walking, use a cane all the time.
I seldom remember any one's name, do not drive the car anymore, at the recommendation of my Neurologist, and take enough prescription medicines to keep a small pharmacy in business until I die!!
And these are only the outside symptoms that a blind man on a galloping horse could see.
The people who pass judgment on my do not observe how bad my nights are, how confused I get.
The fact that I hallucinate realistic and sometimes frightening people, animals, and situations, often.
I have difficulty reading, do not know were I am, what day it is, or even what time of the day it is.
There are many other issues, but you get the idea.
How does a person with early cancer look?
How does a person with a colon tumor look?
I had a pre-cancerous colon tumor that caused me to have the ascending portion of my colon removed!!
I looked just fine!
I am actually thinking of getting a name tag made that says;  I have Lewy Body Dementia!
I am NOT faking!
If you cannot deal with that, leave me alone!

I may be selfish and self-centered.
It is hard not to be when you are suffering from any incurable, progressive, life ending, disease like LBD.
Yes, the end can come slowly, but it IS coming.
And sooner than it would have if I did not have LBD; at least in theory.
I also know family and friends have their own lives.
Their jobs, families, hobbies, children, and home maintenance, to name just a few things that keep them from visiting and calling.
My Navy career took up the majority of my life from 1969 to 2010.
I neglected my family, son, parents, other relatives, and friends to do what the Navy needed me to do.
I volunteered for the tough assignments, rode deploying ships,  worked late to make sure my equipment worked, and avoided anything that looked like easy jobs.
So, I do understand their position.
Just the same, I feel abandoned and neglected much of the time.
Are these feelings valid on my part?
I guess that depends on which side of the issue you are on.
I do not expect or deserve 24/7/365 care, visitation, and coddling.
But, once in a while would be welcomed.
So, that is the end of my self-centered complaining for the moment.
LBD IS a lonely disease.
And I have written before that I believe living in Assisted Living is better for the spouse of the Dementia patient because she would get the good times with me and I could be alone, in the care of the professionals, when I am being difficult.
But, she has to bee there to share the good ties or my theory is wrong.
I believe she will be.

<doc date=Sunday, March 5, 2017>
We live in a retirement community that has a large population of older folks.
Many in very good health, others with serious health issues, and some that deny having serious health issues.
But I have watched how different diseases impact married relationships.
Some couples draw closer together and find new strength to find a way to live with the disease, closer together, more in love.
Yet, some couples fall apart, loose contact, and are no closer that two people that live in the same town.
I see spouses of Dementia patients that protect their spouse and shield them from life.
And I see spouses that dump their spouse in Assisted Living and never visit them.
The travel, go out, enjoy their new freedom, without the anchor of the Dementia Spouse to ruin their lives.
This "Disease Divorce" happens in all debilitating diseases that I see here.
So, Dementia is not the only Disease that causes this.
I completely realize I am difficult to live with.
That is why I asked the Neurologist to give me a medicine to calm me down and let me sleep at night.
And, since my LBD is getting WORSE I, more and more, don't want to be with people.
I refuse telephone calls, don't call people I used too, and do not pay attention to the world around me.
Many nights, I go to bed angry, depressed, and ready to fight anyone for any reason.
Of course, the Clonazapan finally takes hold and I go to sleep.
But soon, hopefully not for another ten months, I will move to the Memory Support Unit in Assisted Living.
I wonder how that will work out.
Right now, i have difficulties  being positive about anything in my life.

<doc date=Friday, February 17, 2017>
The other night, I was just drifting off to sleep, alone in our bed, and I sat bolt upright completely unaware of where I was.
I did not know what State, City, home, room, or even the day or month!
I was lost.
It took a few minutes for that to pass as I looked around the bedroom and began to recognize where I was.
This has happened before, but this time I was more frightened.
I had my six month check up this week with my Neurologist and she spent some time questioning on this event and then connecting it to my hallucinations.
They may be related.
I had not considered that.
But then, I am not a Neurologist.
We also addressed m night time anger and agitation.
I was diagnosed clonazepan  to take at night to help me with this.
I took it early in my journey and I remember it helping.
My Wife has a different memory of this drug.
One of the doctor's here in Pensacola changed it and I have had night time issues since then.
I hope it works this time.
Taking different drugs is an experiment every time.
We will see how this goes, starting tonight.

As I have written, we moved to a one bedroom apartment in late December.
We were in a 1200 sq ft two bedroom apartment and I never felt comfortable there.
I wandered around the community and talked to people, looked at different parts of the community, and looked at vacant apartments.
If I was in the apartment, I sat in my chair or went to bed.
I seldom used the other rooms except to escape the political discourse on television that my Wife liked to watch.
Then I would go in the second bedroom, which we used as an office and put my headphones on.
Now, in our 600 sq ft one bedroom, I am comfortable.
I feel safe and complete.
I seldom go out of the apartment to seek companionship or relaxation.
The apartment has become my "safe place".
I also love the view out of our living room winds.
Trees, large lawn, bushes, flowers, squirrels, butterflies, birds, and the changing weather.
Both Marcel the Wonder Poodle and I love the show out of that window.
I find this interesting since we spent much of our life chasing bigger, better, newer, and more modern!
Now, I seek a compact, safe, comfortable, apartment that holds me in it's soft, secure embrace.

Trust me, I cleaned that title up!
I enjoy playing billiards on Wednesday and Sunday Evening.
I am even improving!
But, there are a couple of men that play those nights that are very, very liberal  ;politically!
And they like to espouse their left wing dribble when we play billiards.
Now, I am a very conservative person, politically.
But I seldom express m political views here at Azalea Trace, because I know some of my fellow residents are very liberal and I do not want to offend the,  But these two individuals do not seem to have the same common sense and decency that I have.
In any case,  last night the liberal pool players were on their game, politically that is.
And the aggravated me.
Now, I had two choices.
First choice;  Get very angry, verbally flame spray them,  therefore alleviating them.
This was a bad idea because I was beginning to feel my old "Kick some Ass" emotions beginning to rise.
The second choice was to leave.
Since I still want to be respectful of other people's feelings, I left, after winning the game we were playing.
I said nothing about why I was departing.
I just left.
I spent the rest of the night pretty upset!
But, no one got hurt!
And no one's feeling got hurt, I hope.
I am going to stop playing for a while, to see how my emotions settle out on the issue.
I am also going to cocoon for awhile, just to help me calm down.
Of course, last night I was going to destroy my Pool Cue!
Since so many folks deny I have LBD, they are not in tune with the idea that I have emotional control issues because of my disease.
The deny the impact of "Sundowning" and they show now concern for my well being.
Actually, they are a group of self-centered assholes who need their ass kicked!!
I wonder what the community punishment is for that offense.
No, I think I will just cocoon for a while.
Discretion IS the better part of valor.
I hope I remember that for a while longer.

My wife is showing the effects of the stress that comes because of the impact of LBD on me.
She denies it, to me, but I know.
Little things become overwhelming issues for her.
She is having memory issues of her own.
Short term memory issues caused by the stress of watching me deteriorate.
Difficulty doing things she really likes, because her mind just cannot process the steps to complete the task.
Even driving is becoming frustrating and difficult for her.
She recognizes these issues but will not address them.
I have asked her to, but she refuses.
It seems to me, our lives are falling into an abyss of confusion and dispair.
I have known for a long time that LBD would run my life, eventually.
Well, we are there, and there is not good.     
</doc>
<doc date=Sunday, January 29, 2017>
Think for a moment.
I have Lewy Body Dementia.
I suffer from "Sundowning" and my evenings are difficult at best.
I try VERY HARD to keep an even keel for my Wife.
She does not understand what I a going through, even though I have tried to expelling things and she has scanned clinical information related to my disease from LBDA.Org.
So, as the sun goes down, we are on a different plain with different expectations.
I understand that she cannot possibly understand how noise, projects, personal demands, budget issues, and many other normal life matters negatively impact me.
She also cannot understand how hard I try to stay calm, and unexcited for HER well being.
Of course, all of this makes my life worse.
So, as I sit here, trying not to get upset by the morons on "Finding Bigfoot", and it cross my mind, maybe it is impossible for two people, one without Dementia and the other without Dementia, to live together.
Also, it may be a very bad idea for a spouse or other close relative to be a Dementia patient's caregiver.
Because the are NOT trained to care for us and they want us to be normal again.
They also want us to live forever, and that is not going to happen either.
But, the Wife, Husband, Child, wants their Husband, Wife, Father, to be normal and there always.
That emotion is normal, but not rational and not comforting to the Dementia patient.
At least, not to me.
And everything in my life has changed!
I am unable to have sex, drive, do simple tasks like math or budgets.
I get exhausted doing things I used to do all day and all night.
Everyday requires a nap.
The things I watched and did for intertwinement and recreation are now either too upsetting or beyond my capabilities.
The things I was interested in, passionate about, are now uninteresting because I KNOW I will never do them again.
All that I was is gone, dead, and I am a captive of LBD.
I am completely overloaded with frustration and anger.
I feel unimportant, not listened too, and ignored.
I also feel like a burden.
Because I have LBD, I do not meet anyone else's expectations.
And, to make me meet their expectations, they beat me with their reality!
Do this, look at this, what is your opinion on this future issue!
The temperature is too hot, now it is too cold!
Truthfully,  I don't care!
Just deal with it.
No, I believe, based on how I feel, that living in a Memory Support Facility would be better for me and also for my Wife.
The shock initially, would be emotional and traumatic.
And, since we just moved to this one bedroom apartment to reduce our cost of living, we have to live here one year before either of us moves to a higher level of care to keep that reduced cost.
So, I will stay in the apartment, trying to keep my emotions in check, and trying to pretend to be as normal as I can.
Remember, I try to write true emotions and to record the actual impact of this disease in this blog.
This is as real as I can get.
Don't hold it against me, just try to understand it.

My last post, some hours ago reflected on how Sundowning impacts my television viewing.
But LBD is a very lonely disease.
Yes, I talk to friends on the telephone, email them, and have individuals and couples here at Azalea Trace that I am friendly with and enjoy eating meals with in the dinning room or other activities.
But no deep friendships, people in my living room, or in-depth conversations.
My Wife is very introverted, she always has been.
Her parents were very secluded and secretive.
They have no friends and had limited contact with very few relatives, ever!
And while my Wife and I have a great relationship, I long for contact with my friends of the past.
People I have things in common with and share life experiences with.
But, alas, no one comes to visit.

Today, I put up the drapes in the living for the third time!
It is a long story, but the end product is, after two types of curtain rods, three different types of curtains, and two lengths of brackets, not to mention numerous holes in the wall to patch, the drapes are up and we like them.
Then, today, we finally got the pantry organized.
So, all is done, we are fully moved in, and we are very happy with our decision to move to the one bedroom apartment.
One of the funny issues is doing the laundry.
We had a washer and dryer in our two bedroom and many times, I would decide I wanted to wash the pants I had on, or the under ware I had on, when I was loading the washing machine.
No issue right?
Well, yesterday, I got to the laundry room on the third deck and decided I needed to wash the Levi's I had on.
I thought, not a good idea!
I guess I will have to plan better in the future.
This was a good move for us in everyday.
We should have moved into a one bedroom first.
But, it it s what it is.
All is good now.
I feel better, sleep better, and the smaller apartment fits us better.

Last night, as I started to relax for sleep, I started a thought process about what I would do if my Wife would predecease me.
My thoughts immediately went to leaving Pensacola, moving back to Virginia Beach and all my friends.
Getting an apartment in an over 62 community.
Buying a new pick up truck and getting back into shooting!
Then, in a shock, it came to me;  Who was going to manage my medicines?!
You see, without Linda, I can not put my medicines together for the week, well enough remember to take them!
I also cannot manage the budget, taxes, or the events of my day.
Oh yes, and I am not supposed to drive alone!
And, most likely, the next Neurologist's visit, I will not be able to drive at all.
The, I realized, I am where I will love until I die.
I am a prisoner for life.
Oh well, it is a nice place to be a prisoner.
The food is good, the living conditions are great, there is plenty to do, and the weather is good.
I guess I can deal with tis prison.

Since we moved into Azalea Trace, I have voluntarily helped the Staff Chaplain anytime he asked me.
I enjoy doing God's work and Jim provides me many opportunities.
He is very busy with funerals and hospital visits, considering the community I live in.
So, helping him, helps him serve others and for that I am glad.
The last four weeks I have stood in for Jim for the Tuesday Chapel Service in Skilled Nursing.
It is a well attended service complete with hymns, responsive reading, music provided by two very dedicated musicians,  and of course a Sermon.
Each time I stand in for Jim on Tuesday, I have to set up the entire service including selecting the Hymns and Responsive Reading as well as writing and delivering the Sermon.
It is the Order of Worship that has cause dmd increasing difficulty.
It seems I cannot translate the Hymn names and numbers from the Hymnal to the printed Order of Worship.
This confusion has become a source of humor for the two musicians.
They have to figure out what Hymn I really want.
One time, recently but not in this four week run, I used the wrongHymnal all together!
That caused some confusion for all of us!
I am also having issues and difficulties delivering the message.
I get confused with verses, cannot find them in the Bible unless I mark the pages or print out the verses on my script, and even then, I get confused.
More and more, I am feeling disconnected and disoriented even in familiar surroundings and doing familiar tasks.
Many people do not catch my difficulties, but the Organist and Pianist both do.
They are kind about it and even find some humor in my difficulties which they share with me after the Service.
I actually appreciate they humor and enjoy the laugh.
But, things are getting difficult and I know m ability to deliver an understandable service are drawing to an end.

The Activities Director is planning a trip to the USS Alabama next month.
It is on a Tuesday and I want to go.
Not as a tourist but as a tour guide for others.
I know more about Battleships than anyone here and most living people.
But, there is a problem, the trip happens on a Tuesday and that is one of my Wife's Bible Study Fellowship (BSF) days.
She told me I should not go because I get disoriented and tree and I most likely would have difficulties.
And she is very protective of me and does not want me alone if those issues occur.
So, I am restricted to Quarters!
I agree with her, in principle, but I think someone on the trip could help me if I needed it.
But, would they know what to look for in my actions and mental capabilities?
The obvious answer is no.
But it still bothers me that I no longer can go places that I want too, on my own.
It is an unavoidable fat of my LBD. 
</doc>
<doc date=Tuesday, January 10, 2017>
The last two weeks have been difficult.
We are completely moved into our new apartment.
Everything is in it's place, although we sometime have difficulty finding that PLACE!
But, we have not established a routine and that is causing me great difficulties.
I have not had a nap in two weeks!
My days do not have order.
That coupled with being busy since Christmas filling in for the staff Chaplain and I am overwhelmed.
I have become more confused, I have noticed my BP running higher, and last night I wet the bed.
So, the move has negatively impacted me and my LBD has definitely progressed.
Even writing this post is difficult because I cannot connect my thoughts to the keys.
Today, I had difficulty Preaching in Skilled Care because my ability to remember and deliver what I wrote was severely impaired!
I was not prepared for this and I am concerned I will not rebound, ever.

<doc date=Sunday, January 8, 2017>
Living in a retirement community, you have to understand that many people want to monitor what you do.
Naturally, there is the management and staff.
That make perfect sense since they are responsible for our well being.
Then there are those "inquisitive" fellow residents that just have to know everything about you and your personal business!
Believe me, they ask some very personal questions!
So, naturally, we have been fully questioned about the reasons for our move.
Now, I know a number of folks that have "downsized" since we moved in over two years ago.
And I am very sure their under ware was thoroughly inspected also!
Still, it is a little aggravating to have the "Spanish Inquisition" directed at you every time you go for a meal!
But, here are the REAL reasons we moved.
First and foremost was our budget.
When we were offered the Two Bedroom Master, we did not thin we could afford it.
But, we were assured we could.
Well, numerous government programs and no COLA's convinced us we were right.
Now, we could drain our saving and sty in the two bedroom of another ten years.
But we are not people that spend every penny we have.
The move reduces our monthly outlay by $710 a month.
Nothing to sneeze at!
Second, having rooms you seldom use, furnishing them, cleaning them, heating and cooling them, makes little sense and also makes the electricity bill higher!
Additionally, people here at Azalea do not come to your home to socialize.
They socialize in the common areas.
The lounges, card rooms, Dinning Room, auditorium, and recreation facilities.
Their apartments are their private refuges.
Third, this move with it's reduction in rent, will also reduce the cost of any higher level of care either go us might require.
Now, we have to be in the One Bedroom for one year before we need that increased level of care to receive that benefit.
But, it is still a definite benefit.
Fourth,  a smaller, more cozy, apartment makes me feel more secure.
Remember, I have to know, every minute of every day, where my wife is.
If she was in the master bathroom and I was in the living room, I would call out and ask where she was!
In the one bedroom apartment, if I sit in y recliner, I can see every room and who is going where.
Seems silly to you, I know.
But that is how my LBD mind works.
And finally, I know I will most likely be a charter resident of the new Memory Support Facility that ACTS is adding during the soon to be started Assisted and Skilled Care facility expansion.
A one bedroom apartment would be good for my Wife with me living in a different part of Azalea.
So there you have it.
Our reasons for our move.
Oh, how do I answer the inquisitions here?
"WE moved because we wanted too!"
</doc>
<doc date=Sunday, January 8, 2017>
I wrote before that  the move, just 50 feet or so around the corridor, was very difficult.
It has impacted me in various ways.
Hallucinations have increased.
I am seeing people that obviously are not there.
I am more lost when we are in the car.
And I am very agitated!
Yesterday, we had to move a few things OUT of the apartment that just did not fit.
Our Son came to help and we were done in record time.
Now, all of the pictures are up, we have put almost everything in it's place, and our "Tiny House" apartment is starting to look like home.
I like it here!
I just have to get used to where everything is.
</doc>
<doc date=Thursday, January 5, 2017>
We slept until 10AM today!!
Then we got busy putting things away, putting up art work and pictures, and getting rid of some things we moved into the new apartment.
Sometimes things you thought would fit, just don't!
Sometimes, you look at things you bought and ask yourself;  Why did we buy that!?
The apartment is beginning to look like home.
So, this will be the last report on the move.
It has been a very difficult process.
Tiring, emotionally and mentally draining, and overwhelming for me and Linda.
You would think moving 50 feet to another apartment could not be too difficult.
Not so.
At least not at this stage in our lives.
And, of course, downsizing has it's own issues.
But, we have found some creative places to store things!!
This move is good for us financially, health wise, and physically.
Our budget is in great shape because of this decision!
We have a smaller apartment to take care of, and we will have a lower rent now and lower long term care costs!
All in all, this move has positive long term budgetary benefits.

The good news is, we are out of the two bedroom apartment.
We turned the keys in today!
The bad news is, we have pictures to hang and stuff to find a place for.
And while we have many things organized, we have quite a bit more to deal with.
I did get the drapes hung in our bedroom today.
That was something I wanted to do but never found time to do.
We also have our car loaded with things to deliver to our son and grandsons.
But right now, we are both completely worn out!
My legs hurt, I have had some hallucinations, and I am too mental exhausted to decide where things need to go.
So, we re going to bed with no alarm clocks!
While the move is not complete, it is close and we need the rest.
</doc>
<doc date=Tuesday, January 3, 2017>
OK, the two bedroom apartment is almost empty!
I have to take the pictures off the walls and the curtains down and mounted in our new bedroom.
That was supposed to be today, but, other things got in the way.
My wife got the kitchen completely organized today and that was a great undertaking, considering it is about 1/4 the size of the other kitchen.
We are both worn out!
But, I have to have the apartment done and turned over by tomorrow.
Last night, I had a small medical issue.
I woke up about midnight, having to go to the bathroom.
I looked down at my skivvies and saw blood!
I called my wife who was still up and we discovered the right side of my scrotum was bleeding, rather strongly.
We used hydrogen peroxide to stop the bleeding and I went back to sleep.
It was no small amount of blood!
I saw the Nurse Practitioner today and she said the move caused it!!
I have been very sweaty, wearing levi's, and moving a lot, doing some heavy lifting.
Yes, I know I am not supposed to do that.
But, these things have to get done.
In any case, the sweat and chaffing caused a worn spot that bled later on.
No BIG deal!
This has been a tough move and I will be glad when we are done.

<doc date=Monday, January 2, 2017>
Last night it rained heavy!
Ferocious thunder and lightening!
So, sleep was difficult.
I had to get up early because the local dry cleaner was picking up two area rugs to clean.
Then, I had to get ready for the Chapel Service in the Skilled Care facility that is part of Azalea Trace.
I truly love leading those Worship services.
Both of those done, I went to work to help my Wife make progress emptying the old apartment.
We rented another truck to take some bedroom furniture to our son's home.
He came over to drive the truck and our youngest grandson and our son moved the  furniture.
During that event, the rains, thunder, and lightening came again, in a big way!
Even Tornado Warnings!
We also moved the cubes and now we are down to small items, more books, and papers, to put away.
We should have the old apartment empty tomorrow.
I will hang curtains in the bedroom and things on the walls tomorrow, I hope.
We sill have a lot to find places for.
Some things will not make it into the new apartment.
Some of those things have never been used!
For instance, we had enough obscure kitchen tools to start a restaurant!!
Since our kitchen is small, gourmet cooking is probably a thing of the past.
No big deal.
So, we made great progress today, but we are getting tired and worn out.
One more day of the big push and we should be living in one apartment.

Let me explain something I did.
We ordered online, some flex light strips.
They did not meet our needs and I wanted to send them back.
So, after getting a return label, I packaged what I thought was the Flex Light Strips and sent them back.
That was 10 days or so ago.
We shifted apartments in our retirement community, and I bought LED bulbs for our ceiling fan lights.
I needed this LED bulbs yesterday and I could NOT find them.
They were NOT where I put them or at least where I thought I put them.
My first and predominant view was someone stole them!
I went to bed angry!
About two in the morning I woke up remembering the return package of the flex light strips and I remembered seeing the strips in a box of things that day.
The light came on, I sent my LED bulbs to the Online company.
I am getting more and more confused and incapable of normal mental organization.
This has been frustrating, and depressing for me.
It has also illustrated my condition and how the progression of my LBD has further reduced my mental functioning, called "Executive Function" by my neurologist.
I wonder what will happen next?
</doc>
<doc date=Saturday, December 31, 2016>
We are beat!
We moved all of the heavy, difficult furniture today, thanks to the great help from our son, two grandsons, soon to be granddaughter in law, and two of the grandsons friends.
But, it was a tough day.
But we will sleep in our new "Tiny House" apartment!
Things are fitting pretty well.
No anger outbursts.
Just good organization.
My wife has worked each night into the wee hours of the morning and then got up rely and hit it again!
She is amazing.
One decision that I made yesterday, came as a surprise to my wife and son.
I have been an avid gun collector and shooter for a long time.
But, I have sold off about half of my collection and kept what my son wanted to inherit.
I decided last night, that he needed to inherit them today!
So, we moved the safe to his house.
No small undertaking!
I believe this is a sane, intelligent, timely decision.
He deserves them and I really do not need to have them here.
So, we wil continue to put things away, move a few pieces of furniture tomorrow, and clean out the two bedroom apartment tomorrow and Monday.
Hopefully we will be ALL complete by Tuesday!!
I am worn out, sore, exhausted, and ready to sleep.
More tomorrow.

<doc date=Friday, December 30, 2016>
We took possession of our new, smaller, apartment this morning.
There were a few a few last minute cleaning issues that the staff rapidly solved.
Then we waited for the delivers of the new headboard, dresser, and sofa.
All of which came later than than advertised, but what's news.
The sofa had to be delivered over the porch railing and through the sliding glass doors!
But, it went smoothly.
Our son and two grandsons arrived after 4 to help us move some of the heavy things and the kitchen items.
As of 9:30 tonight, the kitchen is done, organized, and now we can get the living room and bedroom complete tomorrow morning.
Starting time is planned for 9 AM.
Some things just will not fit like we thought they would.
And our comfort and safety are our first priority.
Many folks here at Azalea have asked me why we are moving to a one bedroom apartment.
Yes we have a large, two bedroom apartment, with our own washer and dryer, dining room, and office.
But, at a high cost for space we seldom use.
Then there is the reality of my disease.
My death will reduce my wife's income and a lower cost of living will help with that.
If I need a higher level of care, the two bedroom apartment will really be too big and seldom used.
If I stay in the apartment for the foreseeable future, I will  be more comfortable in a smaller space because I feel more secure in that setting.
So, a one bedroom, 612 sq ft apartment is better for us than a 1200 sq ft two bedroom apartment.
Again, it is what is best for us.
I my wife and are realists and a planners.
This move reflects that attitude.  
</doc>
<doc date=Wednesday, December 28, 2016>
Our new one bedroom apartment is almost ready.
There are a few, minor, finishing touches and we hope we get the keys tomorrow.
If so, we intend to start moving the kitchen first.
Plates into the cabinets, pots and pans, food, all moved and stored.
Then closets and storage items followed by the clothes.
Then we will move light, easy to move furniture and place the items in those pieces of furniture.
Of course, we ave to coordinate the delivery of a sofa.
Hopefully that will come on Friday or Saturday.
This move will be easier than most but promises to be as stressful as any cross country move.
I am looking forward to this being done.
I am not looking forward to doing it!!
I pray it will be done by Sunday.
We will see.
Stress is NOT good fro me in any way!
So, we will try to keep the stress to a minimum.
Stay tuned for more stories of the move.

Merry Christmas my friends and readers!!
I know, that this season is stressful, depressing, and full of sadness and despair.
It brings back bad memories of our childhood, family arguments, and other emotional baggage.
But, it should not!!
Christmas is meant to celebrate the unimaginable gift of the our undeserved salvation from our sins, from God, by the Birth of the promised Savior!!
The events of the past are erased as are the sins we committed by the Death, Burial, and Resurrection of Jesus the Christ.
If the Savior, who was Full GOD and Fully Man, had not became man, the price for our sins would not have been PAID and we would be destined for Eternal Damnation in Hell!
So, forget about those emotional issues, the past, and the bad times.
Instead, center yourself on Jesus Christ's birth.
Accept and celebrate GOD's perfect gift to you!

Recently, John L. sent me a reply asking some interesting questions about my journey.
Since I believe we are our OWN  support group, I believe it is important to address these issues.
John asled me if I had headaches with my leg pain.
Yes!
And the headaches came on when the leg pain got worse!
That seems interesting, now that he asked that question, although, I never drew the correlation before.
The headaches also are more intense when the pain is more intense.
He then asked if I had tinnitus.
I have had tinnitus since my early Navy days.
However, as I looked at this issue, as it relates to my LBD and the recent, exponential pain increase, I believe the tinnitus also increases with the leg pain and headaches.
Again, I would never have drawn that conclusion without John's question.
Again, no one understands what we are going through.
And if we do not let each other know what we are going through, no one will ever know what to expect.
And I have always wanted to know what was going to happen next and if what I was experiences was "normal" for the LBD journey.
Keep those cares and letters coming!
Merry Christmas!

I have write that my leg pain has increased and has also progressed to my lower back.
I have also written that  finally have given in to using pain meds.
Now, I am on a search for a non-narcotic pain per that works.
My aversion to narcotics is based on the addictive nature of these drugs and the effect they have on my colon.
I had half of my colon removed for a tumor 15 years ago and constipation has become a problem because of the LBD.
So, I really want to stay off narcotic drugs.
I am trying Excedrin right now with limited success right now.
I may try Ibuprofen tonight.
I need to get this under control because the pain is preventing me from sleeping for any long periods.
Last night, I finally got up at 3:30 AM and stayed up because of the pain.
I am not complaining but only trying to record this issue for everyone to learn from since we are our own support group.
I find that my GP is useless for anything related to my LBD.The Neurologist is OK, but inexperienced.
I have asked my GP and the Neurologist to set me up with a Palliative Care Physician, but to date, they do not think I am at that stage yet.
I have a surprise for both of them;  Yes I am!

<doc date=Friday, December 9, 2016>
Linda and I have both noticed some progressions of my LBD.
My memory is worse.
Time, days, months, years, have no meaning or consequence for me.
For instance, I just looked back and found out I have not posted since November 28!
I was sure it was just a day or so since I posted.
I struggle to find words and my ability to hold a conversation decreases the later in the day it gets.
Nights have become a time I hate!!
I am more unstable in my walking and my legs and back hurt all the time now.
This pain has become so intense I am now using pain relievers and if you know me, you know I avoid pain relievers almost all of the time.
Now, I can no longer deal with the constant pain.
Emotionally, I am tired, frustrated, angry, and although I try very hard to be cheerful in public, even that has become more of a chore!
The other day, a 90+ year old lady that lives here with s, was asking me if I was going to watch a College Football Game.
Instead of saying yes, or no, I gave her my real view of College Sports, and trust me, it is not pretty!!
Her reply was;  "I never though about it that way!"
I am also very easy to startle!
Anything out of the norm startles me and I become jumpy and defensive immediately!!
My wife has to be careful waling into the bathroom when I am in there brushing my teeth because I do not hear her moving my way and when I see her, I draw my fists up ready to fight!!
And since I live in my past and not the today, I am now overwhelmed by my failures and sins ov my past,  The circumstances of my birth and raising, the crimes of my youth, and the good and bad of my Navy career.
It seems the negatives out weigh the positives.
Or at least, that is how my mind tortures me.
Things have gotten worse and I am not sure what comes next.
There is nothing written, that I have found, that gives me a road map.
I have no one to ask, no Doctor to consult, and no association that has any help for me.
I am truly alone on an uncharted mental world.
Am I frightened?
Yes.
And I no longer find this disease interesting.

My wife was writing to one of her work friends back in Virginia Beach and she was describing her life.
A leader in Bible Study Fellowship, a leader in our Churches Women's Fellowship, organizing our Church Library, and working in the Library here at Azalea Trace.
I commented that she was not giving herself credit for being my full time care giver!
She looked at me like I was crazy, but think of it.
She cannot tell me to go to the store and buy this,  because I don't drive.
I cannot run errands, and if I need to go to the doctor, dentist, or anywhere else, she has to take me!
Then there are my meds!
If she does not monitor me, I forget to take them.
Not good.
Additionally, I do not know what I take, so I cannot organize my many meds.
I cannot order them, keep them straight, or deal with the pharmacy or the insurance companies.
As for our budget, forget it!
I have not dealt with that job in years.
She constantly monitors where I am, all the time.
If I stay too late at Billiards on Sunday or Wednesday night, she is checking on me.
She does leave me alone for 3 hours on Tuesday and Wednesday mornings.
but I have so much to do on those days and I am so dedicated to accomplishing those chores, she is sure I will not wander.
But if I ever do, she will never leave me alone again!
It is my opinion that my wife vastly underestimates the stress, workload, and responsibilities she has because of my LBD!
But I know what she does and I appreciate her!

LBD is an interesting disease.
It does not follow a logical progression.
Instead, there are good days and bad days, good hours and bad hours.
Many times, I feel good, even connected to the world around me.
Then, just as quick, I am disconnected, agitated, angry, and disoriented.
Another thing I have learned on my journey, the downturns happen in "Steps" instead of slopes.
I will be going along on a "mental and physical plateau" , a new normal, and then, "BANG!
", I drop to a new plateau.
Another thing that is maddening is that as long as I am discussing the past, I seem normal to those around me.
But "Today" is something I am not connected to and seldom discuss or even think of.
Instead, I mentally live in my past, remembering and discussing things that happened to me in the Navy and before.
Some of these events make me happy and others upset me.
But, that is where my mind lives.

Just over three years ago, we rescued an almost 13 year old Miniature Poodle named Cherie.
She was in bad shape!
Her human parents had died of old age and her last months with them were spend confined in a cage.
She had numerous medical issues but with the help of a great Vet, she improved.
Since then, she was our constant companion.
She immediately bonded with Marcel, our now 13 year old Miniature Poodle that has been with us a long time.
Cherie always had bladder issues due to degenerative bone disease in her spine.
She actually had 6 vertebrae that were only shadows in the X-Ray.
But, she was spry and loving.
Recently, she has spent much of her time in our bedroom, sleeping in her bed.
She has all but stopped eating, except for human food.
Her bladder issues had also increased.
And cleaning up her urine was a burden on me.
She also developed difficulties walking and climbing steps.
Her back legs caused her pain and the pain medicines the Vet gave her were not working.
She would pace much of the time and this morning she could not lay down comfortably.
This morning, we knew it was time.
So, Cherie died peacefully this morning.
She was a wonderful dog.
She will be missed.
Her passing hurts.

Christmas and New Years have always been difficult for me.
I do not have the warm, fuzzy, emotions about this time of year.
My Christmases were filled with guilt, arguments, and my forever self questioning of why the man who was my biological father never wanted to have anything to do with me.
That being said, again, this Holiday season will be even more difficult for me.
We are getting ready to move not our one bedroom apartment, after the first of the year.
That requires some downsizing and sorting of old files, belongings, and memories.
Then, my recent blood tests for my doctor's appointment have turned p a potential issue of undetermined origin.
It seems my white blood cell count is elevated.
It may be nothing.
But, add to that a new pain in the left side of my chest when I take deep breaths, a difficulty to get that deep breath, and a history of asbestos exposure and I am sure you can see where I am a little concerned.
Now, this may be nothing, but it did come out of nowhere!
The move to the one bedroom was my idea.
We really expected to get a one bedroom apartment when we moved in, but the large two bedroom was available and we took it, knowing, it was too expensive.
Then some unforeseen financial hits happened and we were very tight.
This move will prevent that from happening again, I pray.
The move is actually comforting to me, but the process if maddening and anything but smooth.
I had expected to be moved by Christmas.
But, that will not be the case.
Another frustration.
The new apartment, reminds me f the television show, "Tiny House Nation".
Yes, technically, since the apartment is 612 square feet it is not a Tiny House.
But, downsizing from 1200 to 612 square feet still requires planning, sorting, and reduction of stuff!
Once we are moved, I am sure we will be more comfortable, financially and emotionally.
So, once again, health issues and frustration issues are driving my LBD into the limit stops.
Oh well, I will probably forget all of this sooner rather than later and all will be right in my world.
But, I thought I would let you know I why I had not written a post in a while and how I was doing.
More later.

A number of changes are happening in our lives.
Some directly related to LBD and some related to our future as it is impacted by LBD.
First, we have been on the waiting list to move to a one bedroom apartment here at Azalea Trace.
We originally moved into a 1200 sq ft two bedroom that is magnificent and expensive.
We wanted a one bedroom when we moved but nine were available.
We tried the two bedroom, but it is time to move to the one bedroom and one is now ready for us to remodel.
Not a big remodel, but some to make things the way we want them.
We will save $800 a month!
Why move?
Budget for one.
Our retirement income has dropped ever since we retired due to increased taxes, Medicare part B increases, and increases in the REAL cost of living without any COLA for four years!
So, to ensure our future financial health, we decided to make the downsizing move.
But, there are other benefits.
This big two bedroom is too much for my Wife if I am in Assisted Living/Memory Care.
And that is where I am headed, sooner than later.
So, this move to the One Bedroom will make our future easier logistically and financially.
Now, on to new LBD symptoms.
To say my memory and mental executive function is getting worse is an understatement best illustrated by the following.
I was sitting on the toilet, doing my business, when I got the urge to get up and leave the bathroom.
Mind you, I was not done doing my business!
Messy to say the least.
I actually forgot what I was going, even though it was still going on!
I have also noticed that my irregular heartbeat issue may be getting worse.
How?
I could never tell I had an irregular heartbeat by taking my own pulse.
The other day, I had my had on my until, with my legs crossed and I could feel my pulse stop and start!
It would got for a number of beats and then stop, and then start again.
Interesting.
So, things are progressing as I say.
And all the budgetary and living accommodation changes will make future financial issues easier.
Oh well, as long as I know where my coffee cup is!

Anger is a strong emotion and one that I can no longer process logically.
My emotions overwhelm me and I am consumed by the anger instead of the topic that made me angry.
I realize it is because of my LBD but that does not help me accept what happens.
Sometime ago, I had a similar issue when I was angry over an individuals treatment of me and I exploded!
I very nerdy got into a fist fight that may have escalated.
But, my dear Wife stepped in from of me and forced me to calm down by redirecting my anger.
She did the same thing yesterday, but getting me to write my post.
The issue I was angry about is still a point of contention for me and I believe Azalea Trace did wrong and I intend to pursue this as far as I have to to set this strait!
But, I am more calm and less emotional now and I can see the facts more clearly.
Therefore, I can now use logic to defeat the wrongdoing.
This is why I need to be in a calm surrounding without confrontation.

Living in a retirement community requires some consideration for others emotions and feelings.
I respect that and I know I can be abrasive sometimes.
So, I have made a concerted effort to be politically correct.
And trust me, that is a real effort on my part.
I have made no political comments during this Presidential season, and have only replied when someone in a social gathering I am in has made comments I found offensive.
And then, only replied with facts and not emotions or flame spraying.
Today, however, Azalea Trace, and ACTS Retirement, have stepped over the bounds of political neutrality and common decency.
Not to mention, they have most likely violated their 501(c) Tax Free status.
How, they have permitted a Hillary Political rally to be held in out Auditorium.
Now, to be fair, in magic marker, over the Political sign is "Private Party".
But, the HRC political emblem is on the sign!!
I have the photos of the sign!!
I have not posted a Trump sign or even a Trump bumper sticker.
Why, because I do not want to offend anyone in our very closed community and sow the seeds of division.
Another resident, who will go nameless, talked to our acting Executive Director, who is also the Southern Region Vice President, and was told they checked with the Lawyers and all was on the up and up.
Well, I disagree.
If, those hosting the "private party" did not pay for the use of OUR auditorium, then Azalea Trace and ACTS Inc. made a political contribution to the Hillary Campaign, in violation of their 501 (c) tax free status.
Azalea Trace should be a politically free zone.
Politics, especially this year, are a very emotional subject.
And emotions run deep in a small community.
I am very, very aggravated to the point of reporting this to the IRS, and possibly looking for another place to live.
I tried to talk to the Executive Director but he is not in, and I cannot find the number two or three persons.
Curious?!
I challenge Acts Corporate to reply to this subject.
I am not the  only individual upset by this issue.

<doc date=Thursday, October 20, 2016>
I have written before about the group we started here at Azalea Trace.
It is a group of Dementia patients that get together every Thursday.
We discuss our symptoms, our problems, our victories, and our lives.
Normally, there are no caregivers there, just us!
The group is wonderful in that, although all of us have a different form of Dementia, we are all ONE in our fight against the disease that is taking our individuality away.
We are accepting of one another's issues and patient with each other as we discuss issues that effect us.
Yes, sometimes we repeat stories and problems.
So what!
We are there for each other and we have all the time we need to make sure each of us is herd and each issue is addressed.
Some other folks in the community have Dementia of one form or another, yet they wish to remain anonymous.
I guess they believe no one will know they have Dementia if they do not tell them!
I equated one admitting they have Dementia to the phrase; "Coming out of the closet".
Someone said, for the Dementia patient, "that closet door was never fully closed!"
You cannot hide Dementia.
I believe being together, just one hour a week helps us cope with our Dementia journey because, for that hour, we do not have to pretend to be "normal" or try to hide our symptoms.
Instead we share our journey and gain strength from each other.
I hope more will join us.
For their sake and ours.

Tuesday is the day the cleaning staff does our apartment her at Azalea Trace.
They do a magnificent job, week in and week out.
I do some things to make their job easier each week.
I clear all the kitchen counter tops, clear the bathroom counter tops and the shower of all items.
I wash the sheets and towels and make the bed.
I have this established routine that is now almost two years old.
It works!
Or, at least it did until today.
I did not mention that my Wife has her Leaders Meeting for Bible Study Fellowship on Tuesday morning, so I am alone in this routine.Today, I threw some odds and ends laundry in with the sheets, including the cargo shorts I was wearing.
I took my belt off, my hanky out of my pants pocket, and my pocket knife out and placed all of that on the counter in our dressing area.
While I was on our land line talking with my best friend Jerry, I started to wonder where my cell phone was.
After our call, I searched all of the usual places.
Then I remembered the cargo shorts that were now in the dryer.
You know, those 5.11 shorts have real good Velcro closures on the pockets!
My cellphone was securely in one of those pockets.
It was dead.
And so are my secret dreams of being independent.
I know, you are saying, people wash their cellphones, wallets, electronic car keys, receipts and many other things not meant to be washed, all the time.
Well, I don't and I never have!
I have a set routine, a procedure, that I do things by.
I run an mental checklist on every task.
It comes from my Navy training and long time experience in Weapons!!
You either do it right or die.
Today, part of me died!
The cell phone is not important.
The replacement was $50.
and we were moved to a new plan that reduced our monthly bill over $30!
But, I failed.
My mental checklist failed.
I lost a piece of my independence today and I lost my dream of being able to take care of myself.
In the Patric Stewart movie on Alzheimer's titled "Safe House",  Stewart plays a retired secret agent with severe information on a presidential candidate.
That candidate is trying to kill Stewart to silence him.
The day he realizes he can no longer project himself, he breaks down and cries.
Today was that day for me.
I once was a romping, stompin, Master Chief Gunner's Mate, riding Navy Combatant ships, firing rapid fire cannons, solely responsible for thousands of tons of explosives and the lives of the men who worked with me and the entire crew!
My word was law, backed by by iron clad memory of procedures, safety procedures, and operating procedures.
Now, I cannot remember to take my cell phone out of my pocket before I was he my shorts!
The LBD has been progressing and Linda and I knew it.
Today was a big drop off in my mind.
I failed a procedure and even though it was a small item, I can no longer trust myself or anyone else to my care.

<doc date=Wednesday, October 12, 2016>
Many things upset me and send me into anger and depression.
Politics, the direction our Nation has taken, the lack of morality in out society, how people treat me, things and events from my past, and my miniature poodles peeing on the floor!!
My Wife is at Bible Study Fellowship.
I get two mornings a week alone, to do what I want.
Today, I was doing some ironing I wanted and needed to do.
Marcel stopped me and told me he needed to go out.
No problem.
Sherry, Marcel and I went out and they did their business.
I went back to ironing, something I actually enjoy, and when I was done, about 20 minutes or so after taking them out, I walked barefooted through a new puddle of pee!!
I realize both poodles are old and infirm.
I love Marcel and I have become close to Sherie since we rescued her and nursed her back to health 3 years ago, but I am tire of cleaning up dog waste!
Mostly it is Sherie, who is over 15 and has Congestive Heart Disease and Degenerative Bone disease in her lower spine.
She cannot help her accidents.
Marcel, who is almost 14 has some bladder control issues also.
He has Hypothyroidism and Congestive Heart Failure.
They both take meds for they conditions, which add to the bladder issues.
The truth is, I am overwhelmed with cleaning up after them and walking them 10 times a day.
I hate getting eaten by mosquitoes during the night walks.
And they have gotten expensive due to they medical conditions.
But the real issue is, the make me angry when they pee and poop on the floor!!
I believe, as hard as it will be, that it is time for them to be euthanized.
I will miss both of them, but I do not need to be aggravated by something I can control, but eliminating it from my life.
I will miss Marcel terribly.
He is my "Velcro Puppy"!
But, it is time.
But, when?
Today, tomorrow, Saturday?
We will see.

I truly do not understand how my Wife deals so wonderfully with me.
Especially nights are very difficult for me!
I am angry, curt, sarcastic, grouchy, and down right mean.
When I get this way, I most often go to bed!!
But, that leaves her without me.
And, she says she enjoys my company.
I truly do not understand how she could.
I am ashamed of my attitude at night, but there is nothing I can do about it.
She is a trooper!
!

<doc date=Sunday, October 2, 2016>
I have experienced a series of recent downturns and processing them and learning to deal with these changes has been difficult.
I sleep more than ever before including a 4 hour nap everyday and in bed by 9 PM every night.
Sleep is my escape, such as it is, since I experience very disturbing dreams that cause me to physically act these dream out.
Additionally,  I am experiencing more anger outbursts and I have great difficult controlling my emotional outbursts.
My Wife told me recently, that she appreciated my efforts to control my anger and outbursts.
That means she has observed my problems and has not told me.
Linda protects me that way.
The vision issues continue, as well as my stability issues and memory issues.
The other night, I was angry when I went to bed.
To help me deal with that anger, I searched my memory for the names of my doctors back in Virginia Beach, where I dearly wish I still lived.
I could not remember any of their names,  I started to go through the alphabet to find their names.
I could not remember the alphabet!
Truthfully, I could not sequentially go through the alphabet.
So, my memory issues are getting worse.
You can see how these issues have compounded and the result is more anxiety, anger, and frustration.
My LBD journey has sped up!
One other issue;  Both of my miniature poodles are very old.
The female is over 15 and the male is almost 14.
They both have congestive heart disease and the male has hypothyroidism.
Additionally, the female has degenerative bone disease in her spine, impacting the stability of her rear legs, and her ability to control her bladder.
Cleaning up pee is my job and I am getting overwhelmed by that responsibility.
Additionally, I am their CNA and I administer their medicines.
Both dogs have their way of making it difficult for me to give them their pills.
And that is frustrating!
I am at a decision point about their future.
I love Marcel and I love Cherie.
But they have become too much for me to deal with.
I am overwhelmed.

I am having more and more difficulty organizing my thoughts.
Of course, this negatively impacts my ability to write this blog.
Never the less, I have issues that are important that I want to discuss.
Like this issue!
I have had a number of issues I wanted to post about, but either I cannot express them or I forget them while I am trying to compose the post.
I am even having issues writing this post because I have many different thoughts bouncing around in my mind, all conflicting with my thought process.
It seems the LBD has taken away my ability to select a single topic and express it.
In the beginning of my LBD journey, the Neurologist told me my Executive Function was broken.
If it was broken then, it is missing now!
This never ending collision of different topics, issues, storied, experiences, and dreams makes writing and communicating in general, a difficult proposition.
It also makes decision making all but impossible.
Think about this;  If I want to ass 2 plus 2 in my mind, before i come up with the answer, a thousands issues related to the number 2 in any form, the addition process, and anything  else that lives in my brain, collide with my thought process.
For instance, I has how many addresses with the number 2 in them, I had a 2 year extension in the Navy when I was on my first enlistment, how may people do I know who had two kids, what were their names, we used to have 2 cars, We had 2 car payments a couple of times, I used to have a 2 cylinder motorcycle, I wish I had another motorcycle, I don't even drive anymore!
See how this can impact a simple addition equation?!
It is like that in my mind, all the time!
It effects everything I do or think about.
This mental confusion and overload makes everything in my life more difficult and frustrating.
Not to mention, that is makes learning anything new or coming up with a logical conclusion or decision all but impossible.
LBD is no longer interesting, it is frightening.

<doc date=Thursday, September 15, 2016>
I have a rather serious, chest congestion, cold, or an allergy issue, or the flu, or Zika, since i have been bitten by many Florida mosquitos.
Whatever it is, I am congested, have post nasal drip, lots of flame that I am choking on.
In a nutshell, I am miserable.
I brig this up, because breathing is important and choking is akin to aspiration.
And aspiration is the number one cause of death for LBD patients.
So, I am sensitive to this issue.
Now, do not get me wrong, death does not cause me any fear of consternation.
I am ready to go home and I welcome the change of address!!
But, the truth of the matter is, being in the late third quarter of a four quarter disease, death is always on my mind and always a constant possibility.
Just the same, I try to take care of myself as does my Wife.
But chest congestion always results in coughing until I pass out!
And that is true misery.
Happily, my bed is adjustable so I can raise my head to help with the mucous.
And hot tea also cuts the mucous, so I am drinking plenty of hot tea.
I have not had this in awhile.
Truthfully, I do not remember the last time.
But, I do know it is going to be a long night!
</doc>
<doc date=Tuesday, September 6, 2016>
It is 1:38 in the morning and I cannot sleep.
So, I am up surfing the WEB and I found an article on the spraying to kill the Zika mosquitos.
And low and behold, after a few research attempts, I discover that the chemical they are spraying is NALED.
NALED is a organophosphate chemical that is very toxic and can cause death.
But, it is also Neurotoxic and has the same side effects as Trichressylphosphate.
TCP is the chemical that caused my Lewy Body Dementia!
And the OSHA Fact Sheets say NALED causes memory loss, confusion, depression and loss of coordination, among other neurological issues.
Oh, and it kills bees, birds, and other wildlife.
Oh, and it can be fatal if inhaled, swallowed, or absorbed in the skin.
And, clothing heavily exposed to NALED must be destroyed.
And, clothing exposed to NALED must be washed separately.
NALED is a Organophosphate and the word "Phosphate" is the key.
Just like the chemical in Mil-F-17111, the hydraulic fluid me, and thousands of Gunner's Mates breathed in, absorbed through our skin, and swallowed, for decades.
If I were you, I would do some research on this one.
Do not take my word for it!!
But, the information is out there, at least for the moment.

<doc date=Thursday, September 1, 2016>
Thanks to my Wife's tenacious work, and unrelenting push, we had our FIRST meeting of the Dementia Patients Support Group.
There were three of us and a couple of nervous caregivers at the kick off meeting.
It was very productive and I was very encouraged that the Dementia Patients are so open about this personal issues.
We now have reserves a private room to meet in and plan to meet every Thursday.
My Wife is working on getting a Facilitator from Covenant Care or the Alzheimer's Association to help with this group.
Today, I served as the facilitator and that is not how I would like this to go in the future.
But for now, I am very happy to fill in this position just because I am so dedicated to building this much needed support group.
I was very encouraged at how fast we began to bond as a group.
If you have had any group dynamics training, you know there are four stages to group development;  Form, Storm, Norm, Perform.
Well, we quickly jumped to Norm today.
We were open about what we expected from the group and how each of us wanted the group to meet our needs.
From those expectations, we found a private room, set up future meeting dates and times, and even started to build an expectation of 24/7 group help.
I am sure future meetings will explore more personal issues and needs.
But today was a wonderful start.
We have also learned that ACTS is planning some Dementia Care expansions for the near future that will help the generation of Dementia Patients after us.
And maybe even some of us.
This was exciting news and I am encouraged to hear of these plans.
Caring for Dementia Patients and their loved ones is an evolving process because of the nature of the disease and the new drugs and treatments available.
Also, dementia is being discovered in individuals earlier in the disease, enabling earlier treatment.
More is being learned in how to house, live with, and encourage the dementia patient.
But, there is still the difficulties of changing personalities, inappropriate actions, and the mental loss of our loved one.
So, treatment and care will continue to change and improve foe the foreseeable future.
I remember, when my Father in Law had Alzheimers in the late 1980's.
To deal with his wandering, they tied him in a chair, all day!
Now, we have leg bracelets that set off an alarm if the patient wanders out of the safe area!
This are better!!
And they will continue to get better until there is a cure!!
Again, thanks to the folks that made the first meeting.
We welcome others and expect some other members next week.
Our group will grow and our ability to help each other will expand.
We share a common enemy, Dementia.
And while we cannot defeat it, we can help each other deal with the effects of Dementia.
That is our goal.
More later.

Many people ask me how I am doing.
My standard answer is; "I am progressing".
And that is a true answer, but not totally accurate.
I have written recently that I have entered a new, phase of LBD.
One more difficult than the past.
This is the REAL LBD!
The past has been the warm up!
Mentally, I now feel completely disconnected from the world around me.
Everything seems distant and no connected to me.
I have little interest in most things.
Things seem dull to me!
Not "Dull" like boring, but dull, to my senses!
No excitement or enjoyment.
Everything is a burden to do.
I have lost my zest for life!
There is nothing I want to do and few things I will do.
My Wife has me participating in some exercise classes here at Azalea and they are good.
But if she did not take me, I WOULD NOT go!
Yes, I understand they are good for me, but what's the purpose?
I guess that is a reflection of the depression I am dealing with.
I now know everything I deal with before in this journey was "Kid's Play"!
It served to soften me up, like a boxer uses body punches to weaken the opponent.
Now, the real punches come when I am at my weakest and I cannot endure them.
Our Pastor who is a wonderful Pastor, Teacher, and friend, sat down beside us before Church last Sunday and asked me about the new issues I was experiencing and I could not remember any of them!
Linda had to fill him in!!
I guess that is a good part of LBD, I forget the things that bother me.
Another issue.
We were walking down a hallway for exercise last evening and I saw a cat, that frightened me!
I was physically and emotional scared!
It turned out to be s stuffed animal, but it frightened me, twice!!
This is getting ridiculous.
So, LBD is now winning!
And try as I might, I know I am not going to win or break even!
And I know the fight from now on will be a difficult, loosing battle.
I hope it is a short one!

<doc date=Friday, August 26, 2016>
My Wife and I would like Azalea Trace to start a Dementia Patients Support Group.
They have a Caregivers Support Group facilitated by Covenant Care that covers all caregivers.
But, I recommended to Management a Support Group for those with Dementia to help us share experiences of the journey that will help each other deal with early and mid level Dementia.
I also recommended tours of Assisted Living and Skilled Care including meals in those facilities, and tours of the rooms and even day stays in these areas to get us accustomed to the facilities so that when we HAVE to move, it is not a shock to us!
A recent article in "Neurology Now" discusses Alzheimer's Cafe" that provide a place for Alzheimer's Patients to meet, without the worry of trying to be "Normal".
My idea of the "Support Group" is similar.
But, management has not moves on this and my Wife has pushed me to start the group on our own.
I have two Dementia patients ready to meet, but we have received some PUSH BACK from the established resident representative.
My question is, why do I have to organize this group?
If Azalea Trace's organizational goal is to be the BEST, then I would think they would have already read the article I quoted and They would be setting this group up!
Not to mention that my Wife and I told the Executive Director, Nursing Director, and Staff Chaplain about my idea, over three months ago, with NO action!
They all said it was a good idea, but no one took action.
So, I am dragging my feet because I do not want the pressure of setting this up and getting frowned at by some "Normal" residents.
And, I do not want to be in charge of this group.
I want the benefit and not the lead!
I am the patient here!!
Not the Doctor, Psychologist, or caregiver.
I need the help!!
So, here I am.
Without a Support Group and under the gun!!
Help!
!

<doc date=Tuesday, August 23, 2016>
Here at Azalea Trace, we have many opportunities to volunteer.
For instance, when the Staff Chaplain needs someone to fill in for a Service or Bible Study, I help out.
Well, our annual fun raising event for the fund that helps those who outlive they savings takes place in October.
One of the Committee members had me in mind for an assignment, but, that individual knew I had LBD.
Instead of asking me to volunteer, that very thoughtful individual called my Wife and asked Her if I would be overwhelmed by the assignment they had in mind for me!
Someone actually took into consideration my condition!
This is the first time this has happened with the exception of my Wife, our best friends Jerry and Marcia, and my Son.
I am sitting here, many hours after that telephone call to my Wife, surprised and happy that someone finally considered my disease.
I feel like I have been accepted!
Someone actually cares that I have Lewy Body Dementia!!
I will say it again, this is the first time this has happened!!
My Wife and I have decided to do the assignment together, to lesson the impact on me while still permitting us to serve this very important event.
I can actually tell you I am happy!

<doc date=Monday, August 22, 2016>
I read an article in "Neurology Now" about communities and Memory Care facilities setting up areas for Dementia patients to socialize where they do not have to feel embarrassed or self-conscience of the disabilities they are experiencing.
I thought, what a great idea.
A place where I can be the way I am, without embarrassment or retribution!!
Forgetting words, loosing thoughts, forgetting names, and even getting sleepy, when I am in a discussion is embarrassing!!
I used to be know in the Gunner's Mate community as a person with near total recall.
Now, I forget my Wife's name!!
And that IS embarrassing.
The other embarrassing thing is having my memory work perfectly when I am with people that know I have LBD!
Yes, that IS embarrassing because it makes them say; "See, there's nothing wrong with you!!"
And then I am on the defense about my diagnosis.
I would love a place that permitted me to be me!
Me with all my issues, foibles, and faults.
To be free to be the way I am with no fear of someone's indignation or judgement.
And trust me, people DO JUDGE ME!!
I have heard, too many times; You don't have dementia!

<doc date=Friday, August 12, 2016>
I certainly hope my family reads this blog, because it is going to become my new life's motto.
I intend to live each day, one day at a time.
I will no longer clutter my life with plans, budgets, dreams, or expectations!
Instead, each day will unfold in the manner God has planned!
I will no longer care or bother myself over money, bills, or the future.
I have no future and I have done all I can to ensure my Wife's future.
There is nothing else I can do!!
So, why worry or fret about it!
And I won't, anymore!
Today was a day of my Wife's scurrying around trying to meet other people's expectations, trying to make the world fit into her mold, and trying to get me to engage in her busy life.
Hey, I have dementia, remember!!
I like quiet solitude, slow motion, and serenity.
When we still lived in Virginia, my Neurologist gained a new partner.
This new Neurologist specialized in Dementia's.
She asked me if I had come to terms with my disease, and I assured her I had.
She then said, very boldly; "Bullshit!"
She was right, then.
I was still trying to be "normal" and to meet every one's expectations of me.
Now, that I am in the beginning of the fourth quarter of my LBD game, I actually HAVE dealt, fully, with my disease.
I understand where I am going the rest of my LBD game and I fully understand the end is death.
So, living each day, one day at a time is a way for me to live with less stress, less fuss, and less anger.
Everyone who depended on me to solve their problems, will have to solve your own problems from now on!
If I knew the solutions, the stress of addressing them would still drive me over the edge.
And, since I know I probably do not have your solutions, trying to help you hurts me!
So, you're on your own!!
A long time ago, I was a rabid football fan.
I was watching a game with a team I supported and they were doing badly.
I was yelling and cussing at the television and my Wife turned the television OFF!!
I asked her, loudly, why she did that!
She asked me: "Do you think they are listening to you?"
Get the point!!
Me getting angry and upset over things I cannot control, makes no sense at all.
So, please help me live the rest of my life, one day at a time!
Note:    Obviously no one close to me read this post!

Today my wife took the Virtual Dementia Tour at Covenant Care, Pensacola, Florida.
This is an amazing, much needed, service to caregivers of Dementia patients of any type.
They used googles, mittens, headphones, noises, pads on her feet, and confusing instructions to simulate what I experience every minute of everyday.
Evidently it was effective because she said she felt like she was in a "Fog" and she felt inadequate!
Those words describe the life of a Dementia patient.
I would like to THANK Covenant Care for offering this service and I encourage everyone who is close to any Dementia patient to seek out this experience.
It will help you understand your loved one!

I have recently developed a feeling, or a belief, that there is another woman that comes to our apartment and has authority over me.
This new woman is never really here but I have the perception she was JUST here.
I usually have this perception when I am going to sleep and in that awake or nearly asleep area of my mind.
This perception is much like me spending half my day trying to mentally complete a project that came to me in my sleep.
normally, it takes most of my waking day to realize I am trying to complete something I dream about.
The dream is not always readily apparent to me so the project becomes VERY REAL!
That is how this new authoritarian woman is.
I still have my "projects" that I can never quite get the handle on.
They frustrate me and make me feel like I am not doing enough.
But this new "Woman" issue is very upsetting for me and my Wife.
I wonder how this will play out?

We had to go out today, to visit a friend in the hospital.
Then we had to go to the FEDEX store.
Then, my Wife wanted to explore some more Pensacola streets.
The traffic congestion, crazy drivers, mixed with my vision issues and endless searches for a Post Office that is no where close to where the Internet says it is, a typical issue here in East Lower Alabama, I was angry, grouchy, jumpy, and ready to scream!!
I have found before our trip and DEFINITELY after the trip, that I need to stay in my cocoon at home.
I do OK going to the Commissary on the Azalea bus on Friday.
The inside of the bus is familiar, I am with people I know, and I recognize the Commissary when I get off the bus.
The driver is a caring gentleman that is friendly.
So, those outings go pretty well.
I just need to feel safe, in familiar surroundings, and not rushed, to be on my best behavior.
Riding in the car, with cars seemingly so close I can touch them, is more that I can or want to deal with anymore.
If you are the caregiver of a Dementia patient, this may explain some of his/her issues.

The other day, I was walking down the hallway in our building and the floor appeared to be slanted to the right.
The walls on the right side were longer than the walls on the left side of the hall.
It did not impact my walking, just how I saw the hallway.
I wrote before, I think, about my issues with my left eye moving an entire column of items to the right of the screen of my computer and then back to the left.
I have had that occur again, only with my right eye.
Also, during our trip, when we were on the road, if I looked down and then looked up, if a car was in front of us, it would appear collision close!!
I actually screamed a couple of times.
This issue is increasing and starting to cause me concern.
I am sure it is related to the LBD and I am equally sure there is nothing that can be done.
</doc>
<doc date=Thursday, July 28, 2016>
I wish that I could vent off my anger and frustration.
I am presently angry over a number of issues and this, coupled with the impact of the trip, have placed me in an emotionally compromised condition.
That is a nice way of saying I am angry as hell, on the verge of crying, and unable to deal with anything confronting me.
I want to scream, cry, and run away.
The issues are only important to me, the effect of those issues on me impacts my Wife as well as me.
I hope this will run it's course, soon.

We received a letter from John Hancock Insurance, the company that OPM uses to run out Long Term Care Insurance.
We have had this policy for 15 years.
In November, our premiums will increase almost $200 per month!!
In my case, it goes from $123/month to $308/month.
My Wife's increase is similar!!
We have note received a COLA in three years.
Our Taxes have cost of living have increased due to fuel and food costs.
So, since we have been retired, our income has declined every year.
Now, this big hit!
I thought the idea of purchasing Long Term Care Insurance when we were younger, was that we paid less for a longer period.
Like life insurance.
But, it seems, the rules have changed.
I believe the Socialist Government's idea is to have all of us dependent on welfare!
Then that can tell us what to do.
I am beside myself with anger and confusion.

Today is the second day home from our 3000 mile trip.
And, we had to deal with my long time miniature poodle, Marcel's, illness.
He has been sleeping and disinterested in food or anything else.
He is uneven on his feet and looks bad.
We went to the Vet today and found out his Heart Murmur is worse and he was dehydrated.
We got some new heart medicines and a saline IV.
He is resting well and was even able to walk some of the distance from the car.
Just the same, the Vet was honest in her assessment that Marcel has serious heart issues that will not get better.
Both Linda and I are upset about his condition.
He has been our friend and companion for over 11 years.
But, his end will come soon and I will be depressed.
Then there was the television issue.
It would not work!
No signal.
The telephone assist did not help so we got an insight tech assist.
That resolved the issue, except my external sound system.
So, I am on television speakers since I cannot figure it out!
Heck, I cannot figure out how to zip my zipper half the time.
My condition has been negatively impacted by Marcel's condition and the stress of the trip.
Everything is foggy and disconnected for me.
I do not want to be around people because if I am, I have to try to "be normal" and I just do not have the desire or ability to "be normal".
Will this get better?
Honestly, I do not know.
Furthermore, I really and truly do not care!!
So, that is where I am at this time.

My Wife and I have just returned from a two week, automobile trip, to see the Ark, my sister in Cleveland, and my Wife's 95 year old cousin in Iowa.
To say that almost 3000 miles in the car was tiring would be an understatement.
But keeping myself in a near constant state of "Showtime" was far more demanding and is taking a far greater toll on my mental and physical state.
The "Ark" is a fabulous reproduction of Noah's Ark.
It just opened 7 July and it is still a work in progress.
But the "Ark" is complete and mesmerizing.
From there, we drove to Cleveland, a 4 hour drive up Interstate 71.
When we got to my Sister's home, she was not there and was not answering her cell phone.
As w looked around her home for a clue, the Landlord came out and told us she was in the Hospital.
She got sick at a restaurant the frequent and was taken to the Hospital.
She and her older Son thought it was he "sugar" but it turned out to be a bad, newly found, case of colitis.
She stayed in the Hospital for all of our visit and a total of a week!
She is now home, with visiting nurses and home rehab.
We did have a good time with my Nephew and his wife.
It was great to catch up with them.
So, we left for Iowa, a two day drive across Interstate 80.
At this point, I should tell you, my Wife did all the driving!!
Her Second Cousin knew he Father when he came to America from Germany in 1927.
He worked on her Father's farm and then joined the U.S. Army.
This Cousin is 95, till lives alone, independently, with some great help from her neighbors, but cooks, cleans, shops, and goes to Church every week!!
Some of the other cousins came over on Wednesday and we had a good time.
But, during these times like in Cleveland and in Iowa, I was constantly trying to be "Normal".
On the last day in Iowa, I was all out of "Normal" and became very abrupt, grouchy, and hard to deal with.
Friday morning, a day early, we headed home, a three day trip!
This entire trip started as a trip to the "Ark".but grew because, as long as we are there, we should visit my Sister and then the Cousin.
We both knew this would be a step too far, but we had to do it.
Both of the relatives we visited we had not seen in 2 years and they are in no shape to travel.
So, we tried it.
And now, for the rest of the story.
I am beat.
I am disoriented.
I am angry and frustrated.
I am having great difficulty controlling my emotions.
My mental capabilities seem to be not working too well.
I cannot find the right words, but the most entertaining part is how my depth perception is effected.
Every time a car got close to us I screamed, squirmed in my seat, told Linda to "look out", and in general, I was very uncomfortable.
As for my wife, she thinks I am a bad passenger!!
She's right.
Another issues in my 13 year old poodle, Marcel, is very upset over me being gone.
He is moping, won't eat, and is depressed!
Believe it or not, his coat is not entirely gray!!
I did not expect this impact on him.
The 15 year old female, Cherie, is doing well, but Marcel is a basket case and I am worried I may loose him.
I am actually forcing him to sit with me instead of in his dog bed.
All in all, I wish I had not made the trip.
It was way too much for me.
And it has been stressful for my Wife.
Let alone the fact that she is waiting for the other shore to drop with me.
She is watching how I react, and how I recover from the trip.
Again, I should never have made this trip.
We should have gone to the "Ark" and back.
Or maybe, no trip at all.
I think, no, I know, this will be my last trip.
We saw, while they are still alive, two relatives that are precious too us.
The reality is, I cannot travel and return the same as I was when I left.
That is the reality of LBD and any other form of Dementia.
I need to be in my safety net, my cocoon, for my mental and physical well being.
</doc>
<doc date=Thursday, July 7, 2016>
People tell me;  You are doing very well and you will live another 15 or 20 years!
When I know, and anyone who understands LBD, I am not going to live 5 more years!
And your telling me I will live 20 years will not make it happen and it only angers me.
Let's look at the facts.
If I did live 10, 15, 20, more years, what mental and physical shape would I be in?
I need/require a cane to walk now.
My legs refuse to move when I first get out of a chair.
I stumble and fall.
I wet and soil myself from time to time.
I choke on saliva, food, coffee, and air!
I don't know what day it is.
I am unable to have sex.
I have no interest in anything.
So, why would I want to live 20 more years?
Just because YOU want me too?
Every night, I confess every sin I can think of.
Why, because I am not sure if I will wake in the morning.
Every night, I feel like it will be my last night!
And I am OK with that.
I have actually prayed for God to call me home, soon.
I do not look forward to fighting this fight indefinitely.
I understand the desire to have those we love with us as long as we live.
How many of us wish our Mom or Dad were still alive?
Or an older brother, a Shipmate, or a long time friend that died, too early for our planning.
But if that loved one had a terminal disease, what was their desires?
Live or die?
I miss Mom and Dad, but they had cancer and the pain and suffering were rough on them.
So, death stopped their suffering.
I am now beginning to suffer, physically and mentally.
And that is only going to increase, not decrease, no matter what your selfish, well meaning, wishes are for me.
Instead of hanging onto unrealistic desire, why not try to help me now, to enjoy the days I have.
That is the best wish I have.

Today at lunch, I choked and aspirated.
It was a minor event and I got through it.
I also had a very heavy feeling in my chest, like my esophagus was clogged.
This frightened me and I started to look for an answer.
One of the other bloggers had the answer.
In their posts, I saw the word "Dysphagia".
I did some research on that word and "Bingo"  I had the answer.
Chocking, unable to control food or saliva in my mouth, heavy feeling in my throat, aspirating, all things I have and have had for a while.
So now I know.
I have an appointment with my Neurologist sometime this summer so I will bring this up to him.
Since this is a later term LBD issue, it fits with the position my wife and I believe I am at in the progression of this disease.
This is a degenerative, neurological disease that leads to death.
I will not get better, only worse.
Everyone should know that.
I do.

<doc date=Monday, July 4, 2016>
I just woke up from a nap, and I had one of my upsetting dreams.
I was lost in a large, never ending, always changing, apartment complex.
There were no particular threats, but I was carrying a large, heavy box of ammo.
Every door I went through took me t a different climate and landscape.
It was upsetting and unnerving.
I woke up abruptly because my female miniature poodle, now 15 years old, wanted out and wanted company.
Now, with my wife up, I still feel lost and unconnected from my own apartment.
Everything is where it is supposed to be, but it is unfamiliar also.
What does this all mean?
Got me.
My wife is busy planning a trip we are taking in 12 days, so that may be part of it.
Whatever it is, I am upset and unsettled.
</doc>
<doc date=Sunday, July 3, 2016>
Last night, my Wife and I had a very good, productive, honest discussion about where I am and where I am going in my LBD journey.
She said, and after some reflection, I agreed, that I have now turned mentally inward.
This categorically documents a serious progression in my disease.
Not only do I NOT want or seek outside activity or contact.
I am overwhelmed and agitated by outside contact and activity.
I am only comfortable within comfortable, familiar, surroundings, and only when socializing with people that I consider safe and comfortable.
For instance; Riding in the car, in city traffic, is terrifying to me!!
I flinch and jump when cars come close to us or cross our path.
I urgently instruct my wife to STOP for red lights, well before we arrive at them.
Also, I need to be with people that I don not feel a requirement to "Act Normal" with.
Trust me, that list is very short.
Yes, I still "Show Time" or at least try to, when we are with people or I pass people in the hall.
I try to put on a "Happy Face" for others.
Especially since they tell me I am not sick anyway!
I truly do not care about the world around me.
When I think about the present world, I get very angry and upset.
I do not like change and that is the theme of our world today.
Again, this inward turn is something I know would come, but to be told by the one person I trust and KNOW  has my best interest at heart, made me see the change.
It shook me at first, but after our conversation, I now understand where I am and where I am going.
From now on, I will turn more and more into myself mentally.
I already have many, out loud, conversations with myself.
In these inner discussions, I present both arguments, passionately.
I then come to a conclusion, that may or may not be based in reality and fact.
That conclusion then has the weight of reality!
And it remains with me as a fact.
It has been a rough couple of weeks, or months.
The fall seems fast and precipitous and I have not found a place to grab on and slow my fall.
There seems to be no one or nothing for me to grab onto for help.
Much like those childhood dreams of falling when you were asleep.
Falling and falling, but never stopping until you awake.
But I will never wake up!
I know that now.
Just falling.

<doc date=Saturday, July 2, 2016>
I have tried to stay connected with life.
I interact with people on the Internet and in person.
I write two active blogs and address issues that impact me and my Navy career.
I have done my best to stay current, involved, and dedicated to what I believe in as a Christian and as a Warrior.
Recently, it has become very evident that my mental filters are negatively impacting my ability to interact with people in a polite, respectful, manner.
Linda and I knew this was coming and we knew my experiences with LBD were getting worse.
It is apparent i many ways but socially, it is very apparent in how I react to situations and things people say in person, on the Internet, and on the television.
You may know that I no longer watch politics or most news shows.
The impending death of America is too difficult for me to deal with.
Many times, people say things that I react with more anger and fire than I should.
But, the mechanisms that used to control my emotions are now broke.
I can also see the stress on Linda as she tries to deal with the progression of my disease while keeping me as involved in life as she thinks is good for me.
This is always a changing situation.
Even the way I react to the normal actions of our aging miniature poodles is different.
Their needs for food, going out, or licking, constantly upset me and stress me.
I am no longer he self-confident man I once was.
Instead, every noise, every motion, darkness, even conversation, impact me in a negative way.
It is not that those things are different of directed at me in a negative way.
Instead, it IS how my LBD effected brain is processing those stimulants.
And this is where I am having terrible issues.
I honestly never expected this to be as bad as it has become.
So, what happens next, is a mystery.
And while I used to say the changes of LBD were interesting.
I now know they are frightening.
</doc>
<doc date=Thursday, June 30, 2016>
If you are a regular reader of my blog, it is apparent that I am having more and more issues with LBD.
I am more angry, more distracted by noises and things around me, and more reclusive.
The new vision issues just make things worse.
My memory is even worse.
Yesterday, I saw the lady that fill sour drug prescriptions on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.
I asked her what she was doing here today?
She informed me it was her normal day, Wednesday, to be here!
I truly did not know it was Wednesday.
I am not connected to daily life at all.
Others may not see my condition worsening, but I do. 
</doc>
<doc date=Thursday, June 30, 2016>
I just had a discussion about my perceptions on how others treat me.
I truly did not want to have that conversation and I did not go as far as I want or need too, because I do not want an argument.
It is not healthy for me to get aggravated to angry.
Trust me.
But her point is others do not see me as I do or as she now does.
OK, I am will ing to admit that most people are self-centered, blind, idiots!
If I tell you I have LBD, and I take all the Alzheimer's drugs at a BIG cost, don't you think I have LBD.
And if you knew me before you would know I would NEVER give up my driving privileges willingly.
Nor would I sit around with nothing t do and be happy.
Nor would I take 4 hours naps followed by going to bed at 7 PM on a regular basis.
I used to be energized by crowds and now, I cannot stand to be with more than a few people at once.
Would I use a cane?
How about falling down.
Every thing about me has changed!
And people that know me think I am faking this disease!!
When I tell people about my symptoms they tell me they have the same issues, but stye are worse than mine!!
OK, where is your Doctor's prescription for Named, Arecept, Razadyne, Effexor, and other psychotropic drugs?
Look folks, this is  not a rash.
It is a degenerative, neurological, disease that is killing me!!
No, I am angry about the manner than people treat me.
I understand it is part of my disease to have these issues.
But, no one else seems to understand me.
Maybe they just do not care.
And by the way, I wanted to interject some strong Navy Master Chief language into this post.
But, I didn't.
Lucky for you.

Covenant Care here in Pensacola is holding a Virtual Dementia Tour, for caregivers and relatives of Dementia Patients.
Their telephone number is 850 202 0928.
The contact person is  Audrey Wippler.
The reasons I bring this up are multiple.
First of all, no one, except us who have Dementia, know what it is like.
I try to relate m experiences to those who read this blog.
But, even my attempts miss the mark.
Second, doing something in the virtual world should appear more real to the person and therefore more shocking.
And that is what Dementia is to the perception of the Dementia patient, shocking!!
My wife is signed up for one of the experiences.
I hope others close to me will sign up too.
And I hope this experience will be made available in other cities.
After all, if it is available in a backwoods, hick town like Pensacola, a big city like Virginia Beach should have it also!!
Did I tell you I hate Pensacola?

I am loosing control of my thought process.
I obsess on negative thoughts that probably are not true, but may be.
This is a new issue, so my mind vacillates between the thought being true and the thought being false.
I am unable to change the thought process and defer to something less stressful that I like and have no personal capital in.
I am reticent to give you the topic of my consternation, but it is personally upsetting.
I realize I am progressing into unknown mental territory.
But, I am also unequipped to deal with this alone.
I have done some Internet searching with little help.
I the past, before LBD, I could change my thoughts to different topics and relieve the frustration.
Or, I could use facts to defeat the negative thoughts.
Neither of these processes seem to work now.
It is curious how my mind confuses itself and me.
It is frustrating to loose the life coping tools that served me so well all my life.
I have done some more research and I will not tell anyone what my issue is because they will use it against me.
It seems this is a larger issue with LBD patients and therefore, I will try harder to deal wit it only own.
I need to be strong and stay in control of my thought process.

Literally, that is a decision I face everyday.
I see talk about the number of Veterans that commit suicide everyday.
Nobody really cares if the Veterans commit suicide!
As a matter of fact and action, the Veteran's Administration is glad we are committing suicide!
Yes, the VA and the Military help Officers.
But the common Enlisted Man is a burden to the government and they would much rather we just shut up, and die quietly.
I cannot get any assistance from my Congressman on my VA appeal, even though he is the Chairman of the house Sub-Committee for Veteran's Affairs!!
Why, be cause I am not a Flag Officer and he does not care.
I am a burden.
But, this post is more than my complaints about how our Government treats us and sees us.
It is about the fact that everyday is worse.
I cannot see any way out.
I cannot make any decisions that will change how my life progresses.
So, I am in a hopeless position.
Hopeless because I cannot change my status, effect my condition, or do what I want to do.
I am in the same status as a child.
Dependent on others for everything.
Since I was 16, I could get in my car, go somewhere alone, and do something.
Even as a married man, I had time to go do things with friends.
Shooting competitions, gun shows, boat shows, car shows.
No more, and no one to go with.
I am not suicidal, but I an no longer interested in living either.
I do not see any joy in life.
Only decreasing existence leading to even more debilitating issues.
Life offers nothing exciting, enjoyable, or challenging.
The only bright point is, at some point I will not know I am in as bad a condition as I am.
Now there is a bright spot!
Come on Dementia.
I think every Dementia patient deals with this.
I believe it would be better if I was with other Dementia patients and with people that accepted me as I am.
Instead, people continually tell me I am not sick, the doctor's were wrong, and you are fine.
Treatment like that does not encourage me to live.
I makes me feel worthless.
Te same way the VA makes me feel.
I have been a throw away person since I was born.
According to the Government I served for 40 years, I still am.

As you may know, we live in a Continuing Care Retirement Community.
This is a wonderful community with some great people.
We live in Independent Living with people that are anywhere from fully independent to needing full time help and probably need to be in Assisted Living or even Skilled Care.
I have also written before that I feel more comfortable with other Dementia patients than I do with non- Dementia patients.
Well, tonight I saw one of those commercials for the home care giver industry tell you the best place for your Dementia patient is at home!
That made me decide to write this post.
I expend inordinate amounts of energy, everyday, to look and act normal.
When looking normal and acting normal is the worst thing for me!!
I play billiards on Sunday and Wednesday night and those two hours are exhausting!
I enjoy the fellowship and playing billiards but two hours is all I can stand!!
Being with other Dementia patients is relaxing.
We all have the same issues and we all understand how we deal with those issues.
Our community is offering a course for Dementia caregivers to experience how Dementia patients see life.
I am not sure if they use computers, virtual reality, or movies, but my Wife is signed up1  Even she does not know how I view life, even though I have spent much time trying to explain.
A safe, cocoon community, with caring, professional, caregivers, another Dementia patients that are housed in like cognitive ability groups is the best of cases for us.
Communities that simply put an escape bracelet on the Dementia patient and leaves them to their own devices is the least acceptable.
But, even at that, atlas you can find someone like you, to be around.
Another past memory is how my Father in Law was effected by outings away from his care facility.
We did not know taking him out to dinner was bad of him, but we learned the hard way!
Taking Kurt out of his cocoon upset and disoriented him severely.
I now understand that and experience that more and more.
But others, without Dementia, do not understand.
Staying home, with someone who comes in, without professional Dementia Care training, in not a good idea as I see it.
Then, the Dementia patient is left at home at night with a family member who is overworked and feeling guilty, or what is worse, is the Dementia patient is left alone!!
My Sister had a life long friend and neighbor, with advanced Alzheimer's that the children left at home alone!
My Sister would go over everyday and make sure Mary took her medicines and that she ate something.
Not until Mary was so bad they were required by the Doctors to place her in facility, did they!
Mary never acclimated and only got worse.
Even with my Sister visiting Mary in the facility, feeding her, and looking after her, she died soon.
Her end days were not comfortable, secure, or pleasant.
So, my view, as a Dementia patient is place me in a professional dementia care facility and leave me there.
Visit me often, but do not disrupt my routine.
This will help me enjoy my end days.

I got up last night to drain my bladder.
Not a new thing.
But sitting in the dimly lit bathroom, I saw a ball of snakes.
And then a larger one coming towards me.
I jumped off the toilet and turned on the lights!
That goodness, no snakes!
But, I was truly scared!!
Things are progressing.

I no longer write long missives because my thought process no longer works that way.
Instead, I think, talk, and write in short, stucco, thoughts.
Compact, almost disconnected, and somewhat without emotion.
Much of the time, my mind dwells in the past and I am mentally transformed to that time in my life.
When something causes me to write about it, be that the Navy Blog or this Blog, I quickly write on the topic because if I delay, I will loose the though!
Eve thinking about how to write my thoughts causes me to loose my initial thought process.
For instance, I was writing a reply to a Navy buddy about a Retired Master Chief I knew.
In typing his full first and middle name, I forgot his last name!!
Sometimes this disease is maddening.

We have a monthly get together of all the folks that live on our floor.
Everyone brings a dish and we spend an hour or so talking and exchanging stories.
Normally, the women are on one side of the room and the men on the other.
Some things never change!
I never talk about things happening today.
Not even the weather.
Instead, I talk about my career with the Navy or old cars, or places we have lived.
But never anything that is recent or news worthy.
Why?
Because I am most comfortable in my past.
I am not interested in the happenings of today.
They are not in my memory and I just do not care.
This is something my wife and I have noticed.
It is not new, but it is somewhat interesting and probably normal for people with Dementia.
I just thought I would report it.

<doc date=Thursday, June 16, 2016>
Where I live, there is a woman, about my age, that has Frontal Lobe Dementia.
She still lives in Independent Living, like we do.
Her sister visits Her every week and we bump into each other and talk, mostly when Her sister is walking with Her.
I truly feel at ease when we talk.
I do not have to try to be normal!
She and I are on the same wave length and that is a comfortable feeling.
It is almost like living in the Chief's Mess, back on U.S. Navy Ships!
There, everyone spoke the same language, shared the same experiences, and were socially equal!
For me, a LBD patient, no matter who I am with, because of how my brain now works, I am not their equal, with the exception of other Dementia Patients in approximately the same stage of Dementia as I am.
That is why the new way of housing Dementia Patients, by their cognitive ability, is so perfect.
It groups the Patient in comfortable, social, groupings, that reduce disagreements and enhances their daily lives.
Unfortunately, where we live is not organized that way and only cares for Dementia Patients in Assisted Living or Skilled Care, without cognitive grouping.
Maybe that will change before I make the move.
Every time I see the Lady with Frontal Lobe Dementia, she asks me when we are going to sit down and discuss our diseases.
Hopefully we will bath remember that and make it happen soon.

Two days ago, my Neurologist called us and told us he had received information that lead him to change my dosage of Nortriptolene to 25mg or less vice the 50 mg he had me on.
He did not tell me why, but he cared enough to call me at home and inform me of an issue in my treatment!
He has won my trust and admiration.
However, we do not have any Nortriptolene pills less than 50mg.
So, two days ago I quit taking Nortriptolene, COLD TURKEY!
So far, no big deal.
I looked up on the INTERNET and I learned Nortriptolene says in your system for 6-21 days based on how long you took it and how much your dosage was.
I have wanted off this drug for a while, so I am probably not going to go back on it when we do get the new prescription.
I can be stubborn sometimes.

My Wife and I love to watch the many "Tiny House" shows on the cable channels.
Living "Small" appear;s to both of us and we decided to go look at some "Park Model" trailers in a beach town close to us.
It was a good idea to take a "Day Trip".
When we got there easily and we were impressed with the Park they were in and the new models.
Today's Park Model is 14 feet wide unlike the 8 foot wide predecessors.
And at 40 x 14 feet, they can be quite big and roomy, yet only 500 or so square feet of interior space.
We fell in love with one and spent some time with the sales agent pricing a model that would meet our desires.
We did not sign anything and spent the ride home trying to decide what to do.
I was having a very good day as far as the effects of LBD.
So, my thoughts ran towards leaving Azalea Trace and living in that Park Model Tiny House.
Even my Wife was becoming intrigued by this new adventure.
The next day we were busy at home and the events of that day took their toll on me.
I was agitated, mentally in a fog, and unstable in my gate.
My Wife and I were shocked back into our reality!
I am not going to get better, only worse, and living anywhere other than a Continuing Care Community is fantasy!
This is not the first time we looked at Park Models and I have wanted that life style for a very long time.
But, my Wife had reservations because of the rules that applied to these Parks in Virginia.
Mind you, the rules were not ever enforced!
But this was the first time she was almost ready to write a check.
But, reality got in the way of my dreams again.
There are many other dreams and plans that have now become permanently out of reach, like me owning a Corvette, a new pickup truck, or a cement home on a large piece of property.
All of these and some I can't remember are now forever unattainable.
LBD is much more than a debilitating, progressive, degenerative, neurological disease.
It is a killer of dreams, plans, and happiness.

I was a Navy Gunner's Mate.
I worked on Gun Mounts, Turrets, Missile Launchers, Rocket Launchers, and the ammunition each of them fired.
I know how the power drives work, intimately, that move those giant mechanisms to precise firing positions and track supersonic aircraft!
So, when my head started vibrating as I relax in bed, my mind went to the workings of the Receiver Regulator  used on the MK 42 Gun Mounts.
I started thinking about Offset Voltage used to keep synchos from zeroing up 180 degrees out.
Then my mind went to the Dither Transformer that keeps the Servo Valve from freezing up.
That took me back to the old MK 42 Receiver Regulators that used mechanical dither.
And I wondered, is LBD impacting these systems in my head?!
Does my head or my body even have a Dither Transformer?
How about Offset Voltage?
YesI know the sounds foolish and maybe like I need to move to a facility where I can get a higher level go care.
Like padded walls!
But, why does my head rock back and forth when I relax?
I looks to me like a 36 speed synchro that can synch up!
Or an Elevation Power Drive that has the Dither Transformer turned up too high!!
I think those little Lewy Body fellows are messing with my power drive!

I have written before that I once had near total recall.
Especially for technical items related to the Navy.
I was known for that ability in my Rating and it served me well.
Bt now, my memory is totally different.
I reality, I have two memory systems.
The past, where I spend the vast majority of my time, and right now!
I live in my past memories most of the time.
I spend most of my days and nights thinking about my Navy experience.
Or, I am reliving my youth.
I still have very vivid, detailed memories of the events of those times.
In may cases, I still remember specific technical issues from the Navy and events that occurred.
The times of these events are shrouded in fog as are some of the people's names, but the events themselves are still mostly clear.
However, they are fading slowly.
The second memory tier I have is "right now"!
Right now is more of an existence rather than a memory.
If you ask me what I did yesterday, I have a difficult time recalling most events of that day.
I do not remember what I ate or where we went.
For instance, playing pool, I do not remember previous shots or even if I am shooting "Stripes or Solids".
I do not remember to take my medications or most people's names.
But recall of recent events, people, or locations are very difficult for me.
For instance;  Last week we went to the High School Graduation of our middle Grandson's Girlfriend.
We went to Her home for a small reception after the ceremony.
There were a number of people there and I cannot tell you the name of a single person other that my Grandson and his Girlfriend.
Furthermore, I have difficulty with Her name, even though they have been an item for quite a while.
This lost area of time is very unnerving for me.
It seems as if I am not living in the "Here and Now" but rather in the past, with brief glimpses into "right now".

<doc date=Friday, May 27, 2016>
Today I was looking at all the prescription bottles and over the counter supplements I take, by the direction of my GP and my Neurologist.
Then I thought;  If my Wife passed away, I could NOT even begin to organize, order, or administer my required medications!!
That was a eye opener.
I am totally dependent on my Wife for my medical care.
Technically, I am helpless and totally dependent on Her!
You may be thinking; Duh?!
But it came as a revelation to me.
And this fact will control the rest of my life.
But my Wife has so much more value.
She monitors how I am doing, everyday and controls my level of activity.
She never schedules more activity that she believes I can handle, based on where she judges my mental and physical abilities are on that day.
She let's me nap when I am tired and encourages me to be active when she knows I need activity.
For instance, today I rode the Azalea Trace bus to the Commissary.
I shopped, with a precise, row by numbered row, shopping list.
I know what we need and where it is.
Then, I get back on the bus and come back to our apartment where I put away the groceries.
After that, I was wiped out!
So, I took a three hour nap and eh woke me up in time for dinner.
We had a quiet evening.
And that was all I was mentally or physically able to do today.
And she knew exactly how I would be when she came home from Bible Study.
Yes, LBD throws her a curve ball every once in a while.
But for the most part, she is in control of my care.
And for that, I am thankful.

<doc date=Thursday, May 26, 2016>
I often complain about the things that bother me or things I hate about having Lewy Body Dementia.
There are thing I still find comfort in.
For instance, our female poodle, who is almost 15 years old, waked me up earlier than I would like, everyday, to go out.
This give me an hour or more of quite time.
No television, no lawn mower noise, nothing but blissful quiet.
I can drink my coffee in peace.
Another thing I enjoy is naps.
Now, I always enjoyed the Navy tradition of "Taking a nooner"  But naps have taken on a larger role in my life.
A nap permits me to recenter my mental issues.
I can sleep, wake up and feel like it is another day.
Not to mention, it is quiet when I am dreaming.
I need and find solace in my daily routine.
Changes to that routine are disruptive to my mental state.
Furthermore, when events are planned and then changed, my mental functioning is interrupted and upset.
I love routine!
I still enjoy many foods, most of which are now considered bad for me!
But, what does that matter?
So, I eat my favorites when I can.
Cherie pie, apple pie, ice cream, chocolate cake, steak, chicken, even mashed potatoes once in a while.
Eating give me pleasure.
It returns me, Mentally, to my Mom's kitchen and the great aromas of her old fashion cooking.
I enjoy talking to people abut my time in and with the Navy.
Yes, sometimes I see their eyes glass over.
But I am having a good time telling "Sea Stories" as if they just happened.
And truthfully, in my mind, they are as up to date and relevant as when they happened.
Finally, I still love working for the Lord.
Any time I get the opportunity to teach God's Word, I am happy, fulfilled, and excited.
I appreciate the opportunities to Serve the Lord that living ay Azalea gives me.
None of these things are particularly exciting compared to what I did before LBD.
But they are the few things that give me a peace and relaxation today.
So, if you are the caregiver or relative of a Dementia patient, try to understand where they are right now.
Learn what brings them comfort, security, and joy and what does the opposite to them mentally?
It will make both of your lives more happy, content, and livable.

When I was younger, when someone upset me, I "Flame Sprayed" them!
I was really, really, good at chewing folks out, regardless of pay grade or if an "O" or "E" was before the individuals pay grade.
But now, I do everything possible to control my temper, remain calm, and NOT be aggressive in any manner, once so ever!!
That causes internal conflict for me.
Some folks, truly need to be dressed down!
And if that does not work, they need their tails kicked!
But, with Lewy Body Dementia, if I treasure my freedom, such as it is, I have to keep my cool.
Today's frustration was very difficult for me.
Now is is night time and you know how difficult it is for me.
I am replaying the earlier events over and over and getting more and more frustrated and more and more angry.
But, what is most frustrating is, there is nothing I can do to change things.
This blog, is my life line!
My way to blow off steam.
Years ago, I would have blown up, got drunk, and forgot about it!
Oh well...

<doc date=Saturday, May 14, 2016>
This afternoon, I was able to describe an issue I have been dealing with.
First of all, let me say, my Wife has cut down on the politics on television.
She also told me, after I made the statements I am about to write, that she had figured out most of this already.
So, here goes.
The coverage of politics on the television, a constant droning of someone's opinion and reactions to every breath one of the candidates takes, drives my mind into survival mode.
When I am in mental survival mode, I begin to mentally build my survival compound.
I do research on the Internet on land, solar cells, refrigerators made for off grid use, bullet resistant window covering, weapons, survival foods, and other related subjects.
When I am doing this, I am happy, engaged, busy.
I can spend hours on this search.
I go to bed building my concrete home in my mind.
Then at some point, it hits me like a ton of bricks;  "You can't live that way!
You're broken, weak, mentally challenged.
You hallucinate!
And then my dreams are crushed and I am depressed, angry, and ready to give up, totally!
So, if I stay away from politics on television, I do much better.
And now, My Wife understands this too.
</doc>
<doc date=Wednesday, May 11, 2016>
A few things gave been happening that indicate I am going into the final phase of the mental decline of LBD.
For instance, my hallucinations have picked up, became even more realistic, and I now cannot tell hallucinations from reality.
A couple of days ago I saw a beautiful golden retriever running past our sliding glass door, down the driveway of the facility we live in.
The dog had a leash trailing in the breeze.
It was so real, I looked out to see if someone was trying to catch the dog.
I was going to help.
But, no one was there and no dog was there when I looked.
Yesterday I had my weekly discussion with my Best Friend, Jerry.
After our discussion, I was reliving our conversation and realized I ran on, talked about the Navy, and kept repeating myself!
Those weekly calls are my lifeline!!
I have NO one to talk Navy with here.
And since I am the Only Gunner's Mate where i live and maybe in Pensacola, I am truly lonely!!
But, I must drive Jerry nuts!!
Then, today, I took my nap and I had repeated, dreams that got more and more violent.
I was trapped, could not breath, and I had the feeling I was going to die!!
When I finally woke up, for the third or fourth time, I got UP and stayed up!
And even sitting in my recliner, working on Solitaire on my IPAD, I still had the frightening feelings of my dreams!
Yesterday, I did not take my morning  pills.
I found that out at 5PM.
I took them then and I was supposed to take my night pills when I went to bed, but I did not.
My Wife forgot to remind me, and I forgot.
So, I am seemingly out of control of my meds now.
Truthfully, I now feel completely out of control of my life.
Furthermore, I know I have no hope of regaining control of my life.
So, as I see it, this is the next and possibly final phase of my mental issues.
My memory is failing, I am repeating myself, and I am now having major issues telling hallucinations from reality.
Not to mention, I am frightened even when I am awake.
And, for all of you who tell me I write well and seem perfectly normal, just as people tell me I do not appear to have any dementia, I reply;  As I write this, I have been up two hours from the dreams, I am now wide awake and mostly aware of my situation.
It is daylight, my wife is home, the television is on, everything is familiar and I feel safe.
LBD is known for it's ups and downs.
And I suffer from those issues, in spades!!
One other things came to mind.
I no longer want to talk to most people.
I LOVE and DEPEND on my weekly talks with Jerry.
And, my Son calls me when he travels for work and I like those calls.
But, no relatives call me!
CJ Tim, and Steve call once in a while and I like their calls.
But I am really getting reclusive.
And if you knew me, you would know I WAS an extrovert.
No more.
So, we will see what the future brings!
Nothing good, I am sure.

With all my posts, through the progression of my disease, I have been very open about the effects, physical and emotional, of this disease.
But, I have been a little "brighter" about the effects of the disease on me.
I have tried to portray myself as tough, tenacious, and unaffected by Lewy Body Dementia.
Nothing could be farther from the truth!
And those posts I wrote that did show the effects were understated.
The truth is, I am overwhelmed by LBD.
I am unable to cope with the effects of the disease and I spend everyday depressed, agitated, and despondent.
Everything, every manner I used to deal with difficult times have failed me.
I cannot think my way out of the "funk" that invades my mind and my life.
The dreams I used to cling to are now empty and unobtainable.
The things I loved to do, I can't do anymore.
I am tired of telling people I am doing "well" or "As well as I can" when I am screaming inside that I am lost, dying, depressed, frustrated, and without hope.
The truth is, once LBD takes over you loose total control of your life, be that the first year your are diagnosed or four years into the process.
Then there is the doubting Thomas that tell you you don't have a disease, are faking it, have had a bad diagnosis, or a mistaken, about being ill.
However, I am floundering in the prison that LBD has locked me in.
A prison that has no release and only progresses the prisoner deeper into isolation and darkness.
The people who used to be your friends stay away.
And if you moved to a new city like I did, you are even more isolated.
I remember when we still live in Virginia Beach, someone knocked on our door.
It was Chuck Morton, a shipmate I had not seen in 20 years!
I was so excited to see him I forgot I was still in my PJ's and had not even combed my hair!
We talked for two hours.
That was wonderful.
But now, I am lost in my thoughts, divorced from my dreams, and looking into an abyss.
How the hell did I get here?

<doc date=Monday, May 2, 2016>
That is always my answer to that question.
I am progressing.
Meaning, the Lewy Bodies are interfering with more and more brain functions, everyday.
And the things the Lewy Bodies messed with yesterday are finding new and more insidious ways to make my life difficult!
How?
Well, recently, I have been living most of my day with a "dazed, disconnected" feeling.
I see things, but they seem far away or super natural in some way.
That feeling is invading my life more and more.
Also, my constipation issues have increased.
Enough said about that.
Body temperature fluctuations have increased in occurrence and variance!
I can go from pouring sweat to ice cold in minutes!
My Blood Pressure extremes continue.
I can tell when my BP is spiking because my ears rig even louder than normal and I feel like my head is pressurized.
When my BP drops, I become unstable on my feet and dizzy.
I struggle even more to find the right words when I am speaking and I am sleeping more and more.
My short term memory is all but no existent and I a now loosing more and more of my long term memories.
For instance, I loose names of old Shipmates and Friends.
Additionally, I cannot seem to remember what day or date it is.
I am emotionally more unstable and the things that bother me, like noise, staccato sounds, questions without answers, politics, news, life in general, and inane chatter impact me more than ever.
I feel the rage and anger rise in myself and then, I go to bed.
These are all normal, LBD issues.
But they are not normal for me and I am getting tired of them.
Add that to the fact that these issues have not taken control of my life and you can see why I am upset, angry, and depressed.
What does the future hold?
More, ever increasing, symptoms,  The drugs are loosing their efficacy.
And my resilience is decreasing.
I have all but lost my ability to care about life as it happens around me.

My Wife is OCD, on steroids!
She has always kept lists,and held herself to unattainable standards and deadlines.
This incessant stress has robbed her of most of the enjoyment in life.
She has Her plan for everyone's life and she stresses herself out trying to keep everyone in the lanes she has planned for them.
She does not have the ability to sit and relax!
Her obsession with politics falls right into her OCD.
Add to that, she is a "Bulldog" when it comes to having her plans adhered too.
If her plan does not come to fruition, she is depressed and angry for a long time.
Oh, did I mention she holds grudges?
Problems, real or perceived, cause me stress, depression, and anger.
All emotions that have a negative impact on me.
Lists, deadlines, and stress are all issues I run from with my hands over my ears and my eyes shut tight!!!
I bring this up, because I need quiet, routine, and no stress, to be able to have as pleasant a life as I can with LBD.
I am not alone with this issue.
Everything I have read tells me, quiet, stress free, routine is the best environment for an LBD patient.
I know her reply to this will be, she enjoys what she is doing.
She is doing what she wants.
Well, why does she complain all the time?
I can see the stress in her and it is not good for her either.
But, if I try to change her path, it is not pretty for me.
And, if the shoe was on the other foot, I would probably be the same way.
Spouses of LBD patients have a tough job.
They have to try to have as normal a life for them as possible, while trying to keep their loved one on an even keel.
I understand that and I do not have a solution for my dilemma.
Nor do I believe it is my job to solve this problem.
What is the solution?
Maybe I should move to Assisted Living.
I realize that after 43+ years of marriage, she is NOT going to change.
And I am not going to get better.
love my wife and appreciate her sacrifice in dealing with my disease.
I try very hard, to be a good patient and as helpful in everyday I can.
I understand her needs but she needs to understand mine also.
I feel sorry for the Dementia caregivers, almost more than I fell sorry for those of us with Dementia.
At least we can escape!

Today, this blog went over 200,000 views!
I appreciate all of your views and even more so,all of your comments of support, encouragement, and help.
When my Wife and Dr. Mary Alliston Bowles, practicing in Norfolk, Virginia, recommended I start this blog as a manner of therapy for me, I never thought I would meet so many wonderful people and receive so much love and care.
While I write this blog to help me, I also write it as a way t chronicle my experiences with LBD and to also help others dal with Lewy Body Dementia.
The truth is, LBD has few first hand reports of the journey and even fewer support groups for those of us suffering with Lewy Body Dementia!!
If I have one complaint, it is that those of us with LBD have no one to discuss our disease with!!
However, I have all of you, and I appreciate that fact very much!

I realized tonight, in my nightly sundowning that I have lost control go my life.
I cannot do anything on my own.
I cannot drive, so I cannot go anywhere only own.
Even haircuts are dictated!
The lady that works in the beauty parlor also cuts men's hair.
She tries, but the person that cuts our poodles hair could do better.
But, I cannot go out and find a barber shop and my wife is certainly NOT interested in that search.
We will spend hours finding anything she is interested in, but, none for me.
I don't drive.
Then there is what we do.
If it is not something the wife likes to do, it does not happen.
So, I peruse few gun stores and even my occasional trip to the local gun show is short because I ride with my son and his schedule is always full.
There was a time that I had my own vehicle, and I went places alone.
Shooting competitions, Gun Shows that were 250 miles away, or visits to friends in the area.
Now, I am restricted to barracks.
Now, I do have a social life here at Azalea Trace and I cherish that.
I enjoy my billiards days and I enjoy conversations with the other residents I am friendly with.
But, I still have to meet certain conditions that my wife, intelligently imposes on my when I am out of the apartment.
Like;  DO I have my emergency button with me, do I have my cell phone with me, when will I be home, and where am I going.
All of this is prudent considering my condition, but it still causes me issues, because I am not in charge of myself like I was before LBD.
I realize I am more free than I will be this time next year.
But, the restrictions still rankle me.
And I would really love a good haircut!
</doc>
<doc date=Saturday, April 23, 2016>
I was just out walking the miniature poodles.
We are a group without a direction!
Marcel is almost completely deaf and blind as a bat.
His nose still works, so he smells his way around.
Cheri see's better, but she is so "Smell" oriented that she gets into a smell circle.
I feel lost, confused and overwhelmed when I am out of our apartment or in the well known confines of Azalea Trace.
Recently, we have noticed that I am uncomfortable whenever we are out.
I know I have written about this issue before, but it is getting more pronounced.
I like to be in my apartment and in the portions of Azalea Trace I know.
For instance, I have no issue walking to the Chapel in Willow Brooke Court.
I know the way, I know the people, and all is familiar, as long as I stay in the hallways.
If I get out of the normal halls, I am confused and in a small panic attack.
Oh well, it is the normal progression of my LBD.
And trust me, it is progressing.

In case you are new to my blog or have as bad a memory as I have, I live in a Continuing Care Retirement Community.
Folks move in her and live in Independent living.
For the most part, they are social, energetic, mobile, people.
At some point, some of them are moved to Assisted Living or Skilled Care.
Both of those care levels where I live are s good as they can be.
Assisted living offers some assistance with daily issues and three wonderful meals a day.
Skilled care is Skilled Care.
However, here it is done with a more "Human" approach.
I visit people I minister to in Skilled Care.
Many of them are still mentally active.
Some, have declined.
And still, some have Dementia to the point they are no longer interactive.
One of the things I have noticed is, people that are moved to Assisted Living or Skilled Care, without their spouse, are forgotten after a short period of time.
How is that?
Forgotten?!
Yes, forgotten.
They are not visited by their spouse, their children, or even their friends in our community.
The people I know in Skilled Care and Assisted Living hunger for a conversation a loving touch, even a smile.
I know of one nice lady, who is mobile, and very confused by Alzheimer's.
Her husband seldom visits her.
He tells me, she is better off that way.
Look folks, even if the person does not recognize you, they at least know you are friendly and they will talk to you, smile, and want your attention.
They are not dead!!
It seems little has changed in the attitudes people have of the elderly.
Put them in a nice facility, and forget about them.
After all, there are people there, trained and paid to take care of them.
I have my life to live.
Even people living in Independent living have few visitors and even fewer overnight guests.
Mostly, people come to eat dinner in the dinning room and then leave, spending two hours with their supposed loved one, at best!
I guess thy come to see when they will receive their inheritance check.
King Solomon was right;  Every thing is vanity.

Another issue I have not reported is my skin issues.
I have bumps that arise, resemble pimples or boils, hurt, and some times erupt in clear liquid or blood.
These bumps also open up when I wash with a wash cloth.
They are occurring on my face, arms, back of my neck and in my hair.
To say the least, this is annoying.
The bleeding may be exacerbated by my blood being so thin because of the prescribed large doses of Omega 3 and aspirin.
I have always told you I am a science experiment.
So, as I said in the last posting, the symptoms and issues are increasing in occurrence and intensity.
My body is breaking down, my skin is breaking down, and my mental capabilities are breaking down.
I guess long term investments are not in my future!

This afternoon, I was sitting in my recliner watching the television.
I was drinking some cooled coffee and I aspirated, BIG TIME!
I spit some coffee out on my IPAD and on the floor and my shirt.
But I could not breathe!
I jumped out of my chair, my wife encouraged me to put mu arms in the air as she pounded on my back.
But I could not clear my airway or my lungs.
I stumbled around the living room and after a while I got some air into my lungs.
It took me some time to get breathing somewhat normally.
I had to use my Rescue Breather for Asthma to get my breathing back to normal.
I also had a lot of phlegm to deal with that was not there before I aspirated.
I was about one second away from having my Wife push the Emergency button.
In hindsight, we probably should have.
But, I settled down and got back to breathing.
But, I am truly not over this episode.
I have aspirated before.
Maybe not as bad as this one.
This one scared me.
It also brought my mortality to the forefront.
The number one cause of death in LBD patients is aspiration!
So, another issue comes to the forefront.
More later.

The cable provider is updating the entire cable installation here at Azalea.
It is a wonderful, much needed, and very much appreciated update for our residents.
Television, Internet, and telephone, will all be faster, more clear, and expanded by their effort.
I thank Cox Cable and The ACTS management for this upgrade of our facilities.
This upgrade has been done in a very expeditious and efficient manner.
Remember, they replaced every piece of coax throughout all of our buildings including Assisted Living and Skilled Nursing Care!
The Cox personnel had to enter every apartment and room to replace cable and cable boxed.
The were in our apartment for a total of 25 minutes!
Amazingly professional.
Al that being said, this is my blog about my disease.
Today, they were scheduled to complete the installation which requires installing a small digital signal box for each television.
That box is even paid for by Azalea Trace!
I received an automated called this morning telling me the progress would bring them to my apartment, the last floor of the install this afternoon.
Around 2 PM, I went out to find where the install team was.
Why, because I had go to the pharmacy to change my prescriptions.
Actually, my Wife had to do that, and I was to go with her.
The Security Guard escorting they Cox workers told me, along with the Cox supervisor, that they would be on my floor later in the afternoon.
Then, at 4PM, I went out and checked again, and I was told they would be to my apartment by 4:30PM.
You can guess where this is going.
At 5:15PM, I went to check and they had left for the day.
I was furious!!
My BP surged, my heart beat pounded, and my body temperature rose.
I could not rationalize why I was not notified by their change in schedule!!
My Wife spend a lot of effort and time to calm me down.
As she was bringing me back off the ledge, I told her, I thought I might need to be in a more controlled atmosphere.
I should not get excited about a small schedule change for an effort as monumental as this is.
We can go to the pharmacy tomorrow.
My Wife can then take me to the Commissary and Navy Exchange.
This will be OK, even though I love riding the Azalea Trace bus to the Commissary on Fridays.
But, it really is no big deal.
But, my ability to see things rationally is broke.
So, living in an area that understands my broken mental functions would be better, I think.
This is a difficult disease and I am no longer rationally connected to my emotions much of the time.
I am blessed to have a Wife that really is proactive as my caregiver.
But she needs time off sometime too.
It will be interesting, the direction things go, and how I react to them.
It is my opinion that soon, I will not be as connected to reality and to my emotions.
My LBD is progressing.

<doc date=Saturday, April 9, 2016>
OK, I know the answer to that question.
I have Lewy Body Dementia.
But I am always thinking about the things that now bother me, that never bothered me before LBD!
For instance, I used to like politics.
I had my opinion, I liked to debate issues and politics got me excited.
They still do, except now it all makes me so agitated I am either out of control angry or , not watching or paying attention to politics AT ALL!!
I look at our society, how our moral standards are GONE!
There are no absolute standards.
People can do anything they want, even if it was illegal or even if it offends the majority of Americans.
Our Nation is bankrupt, financially, morally, and as a a Nation we no longer even have borders!
The things I believed in, fought for, spent my life defending, building, leading, and knew were right, proper, and moral, are now trash to today's citizens.
Am I depressed, exasperated, angry, ready to give up.
Why, because I cannot do anything about the direction of our once great country.
And what is worse is, there is no other place to go!
The entire world is going in the same direction!!
If you never read Ken Hamblin's book; "Pick a Better Country", I recommend it to you!
I met Ken twice and he was a real, patriotic, American who understood we were on the path to our own distraction, a long time ago!
The other thorn in my side is, I cannot move out to 20 acres and be a survivalist because I am just too messed up mentally and physically to make that work.
I just have to sit here and watch America die!
I used to wonder what would be the thing that defeated me.
I now know, it is NOT LBD!
It is the moral decline of the world.
We have gone the same path that other great nations have.
We turned our collective backs on GOD and tried to make ourselves god.
It killed Rome, Greece, England, Japan, and now America, an me.

I have seen an increase in my daytime disorientation.
We went to the Dentist for the six month cleaning and I was disoriented and lost in the Dentist's facility.
I could not find my way from the examining room to the panoramic X-ray machine or back.
I just followed the Dental Assistant.
I have seen this in our apartment and around the community.
It is not all the time, but is occurring more and more.
I seldom remember people's names, but, we do wear  name tags here at Azalea Trace.
Thank goodness.
And it is just one more sign my Dementia is progressing.
I am also drawing more an more into myself.
I believe I have described this as Cocooning.
I seek safety in familiar, secure, surroundings.
Mostly our apartment and bedroom.
This reinforces my point that Dementia patients need a gradual introduction into Memory Care surroundings.
I need to bring that subject up again.
It would be better to slowly get comfortable with the people, the surroundings, and even the dining facilities.
In my estimation, this would be the best way to acclimate me to my future surroundings and situation.
Just the same, I progress.
Or is it Digress?

I realize my most recent string of posts is somewhat negative.
Nut it is how the progression of my LBD has left me.
Tonight, I went to play billiards as I do on Wednesday evening.
I really enjoy the fellowship of the other men and trying to play pool.
I wish I would have listened to my Dad when he tried to school me in Billiards.
He was amazing!
I am too.
Amazingly bad.
I left the pool room about an hour early because I feel tired, depleted, and weak.
I have no idea why, but I felt bad enough to believe home, in our apartment, would be a better place than in the pool room.
I ave not pushed the medical alert button.
I do not feel that bad.
But I have told my Wife how I feel and I will keep her informed if my condition changes.
I do believe I will be going to bed early even though I had a good nap.
Since I have been experiencing a cascade of downward symptoms, this comes as no surprise.
But it requires vigilance.

No one openly talks about Dementia!
It is like your spouse is pregnant out of wedlock!!
Or like they had an affair!!
Dementia is a medical condition that people suffer from through no fault of their own!!
We nee to get "Dementia" out in the open for our own good.
Now, some of the blame belongs with those of us who have "Dementia"!
We deny it, we cover it up, our spouses hid our "Dementia", they do the bills, speak for us, make excuses for us!!
Well, the time for hiding DEMENTIA in the closet is over!!
We must get Dementia in the open.
We must discuss Dementia with family, friends, neighbors, Church members, Doctors, and anyone else who will listen.
And as a person with Lewy Body Dementia, I plead with all of you to be honest about your symptoms.
I plead with your spouses to be open with us and our families about our issues.
The more we openly, honestly, discuss Dementia, the better our care options will be.
I live in a Continuing Care Community called Azalea Trace in Pensacola.
Today, we had a presentation about the Wellness Program that ACTS has in all of their communities.
The Wellness Program includes Dietary issues, physical wellness, and Spiritual Health.
All Very, Very, Important to our health and well being.
But, they neglect to even mention Dementia.
I recommend a program that introduced a Dementia Care Continuum that started when an individual is first exhibiting Dementia symptoms.
A program that addressed the progression of the disease, familiarized the Dementia Patient and their Spouse on the care options available.
As the Dementia progresses, visits to the Dementia Care facility in the ACTS Community would take away the stigma of these places for the Dementia patient, thus aliening the fear the patient may have.
Meeting the care givers so they become friends will help east the pending transition.
Presently, we move the Dementia patient into a sterile, strange, hostile, environment when they are at their weakest, most confused time.
One reason for this is we deny we have Dementia until we are so bad, denial is futile!
Dementia patients need to be open, honest, and comfortable, discussing their disease.
I remember when President Ford's Wife, Betty, had Breast Cancer and openly discussed her disease and her treatment.
That openness paved the way for millions of Americans to seek treatment, early!!
We need the same opens with Dementia and Communities like Azalea Trace are the place for this opens to begin.
But, even a great Community like Azalea Trace and a great organization like ACTS cannot effect change until us, the Dementia patients, openly discuss our condition and seek treatment early instead of later!
I challenge  Dementia patients, Spouses, and Families to encourage each other to come out of the closet and openly discuss this disease.
This opens will facilitate better treatment and better care for our loved ones.
The ball is in OUR court!
P.S.
I have been open about my disease from the beginning.
I have resisted the nay sayers and the stigma of having Dementia.
I have made decisions that, while difficult, will give me control of my future and relieve my wife of having to make decisions when I am so bad that no one will take me!
I retired because I could no longer do my job, even though my employer was ready to make extraordinary conditions to keep me employed.
While I appreciated their loyalty and respect, I knew it was not fair to my fellow employees fro me to get special consideration.
I have always lead by example.
I wrote this post to ask the Dementia Community to join me in bringing our disease, be it Alzheimer's, Lewy Body Dementia, Frontal Lobe Dementia, or other Dementia, to the forefront!
It is to our benefit to do so and we hurt our future care if we fail.

Those of us who have Lewy Body Dementia are living with a death sentence.
But, truly, everyone knows they are going to die, someday.
So, the question really is, what IS important?
People talk about "Bucket Lists".
But experiences, like money, mean nothing eternity.
However, how you treat the ones you love, the things you taught your children, grandchildren, the moral truths you leave them, IS the thing of value you leave behind.
I have made numerous mistakes, committed too many Sins to count, and have hurt the feelings of too many people I love and respect.
My goal for the remainder of the days God gives me is to leave a lasting memory that encourages those who know me to live a moral, God honoring life.
Just because I have failed in the past does not mean I have to continue to fail.
And no trip to somewhere will not leave a lasting impression of God's love on the hearts of those I love.
Yes, I want to see my friends and family, everything I can!!
And truthfully, I do not see them enough!
But going to see something or do something, when I can go see a friend or relative, is out of the question.
I will fill my bucket with the love of good friends and family.
During my recent downturn, I have seen more clearly, how I must spend the remainder of my life.
As for me and my house, we will serve the Lord.

We went to the dog groomers today and then spent two hours at our Son and Daughter-in-Law's home.
It was a great visit, but I noticed I was less engaged in the conversation and I felt overwhelmed and disconnected.
commented to my Wife when we got in the car that I felt like I was operating at half power!
That is a very accurate description of my mental ability.
I am like a light bulb during a "Brown Out".
Not as bright, weak, and flickering.
I cannot keep up with a conversation between three or more adults and I find myself interrupting the conversation asking who they are talking about.
I have commented recently about the recent, rapid, progression of my disease.
I also have seen an increase in my instability and the dizziness.
The bottom line is, my experience with LBD is getting more intense and deeper.
Still, I seem to find a way to deal with this disease and move ahead.
My Wife remains positive and thankful for the good time we have had, and so do I.
But, we both know the future is much darker than the past.
But, God will help us through these difficult times.
Times like these are when Faith grows and strengthens, EXPONENTIALLY!!
As always, I will report things as they occur, in the most honest manner I can.

Regardless of the positive effects of the increased dosage of nortriptolene at night, I am increasingly unable to positively deal with things that aggravate me.
For instance,  today my wife washed some dark clothes and left a kleenex in a pocket.
There was shredded kleenex every where in the wash!!
Since I took the clothes out of the wash and placed them in the dryer, I had to deal with the residue.
She came to help, which the required me to get the vacuum cleaner out!
I was perturbed to say the least.
Then, the television has had a constant drone of politics on it, all day!!
I have explained at length that politics, replayed over and over again, with the same inane questions and answers makes me crazy!!
Of course, then, she has to ask me questions or make statements about what is being said.
I will say it one more time.
It matter not who America elects.
Te same results come out of it.
It is like eating fresh organically grown vegetables and grass fed beef.
It still comes out as shit!!
That is my view of politics and I do not want to be beat over the head with it.
In case anyone does not know it, I have given up on America and the World!

<doc date=Sunday, March 20, 2016>
Well, it has been a couple of weeks and my Wife believes the increase in my nightly dose of Nortriptolene is helping me.
I still feel the anger and agitation sometimes, but it is less intense.
The one benefit I see is I go to sleep, immediately!
As soon as I get situated in the bed, I am gone!
So, if I am happy with the results in that I sleep better and my Wife believes I am easier to live with at night.
I still see the LBD progressing and getting worse.
I am having problems, sometime, making complete sentences and sentences that make sense.
I also have great difficulty finding the correct word to describe something.
The noun name of things becomes a long description to my Wife and she has to cypher out what word I am looking for.
For instance, when I am writing these posts, I have to ask my Wife; "what the thing is that does whatever is called."
She is good at deciphering my encrypted question and gives me the correct word.
So, the word issue is much less frustrating than the inability to make sensible, complete sentences is.
However, before the sentence construction issue arose, finding words was the biggest issue.
So, things change, and for the worse.
I have found that even small groups of people wear me out.
I used to be a very outgoing individual.
An EXTROVERT!
I actually gained energy from a crowd and I enjoyed working the crowd.
of course, back then, I had a wonderful memory!
I remember every one's name, what they did, their families names, and any other important issued about any individual I met.
Now, memory is a fleeting memory!!
Even writing these posts is becoming difficult for me.
Stringing my thoughts together is nearly impossible.
If I start to write one and a new thought pops into my mind, I either loose the thought I was writing about or the new one!
I guess I will never write my novel!!
Well, more later.
If I remember.

I wrote a while ago about the Neurologist increasing my night time Nortriptolene to help me deal with my Sundowning.
The first couple of nights, it helped.
But now, a couple of weeks into the increase, I am as bad or even worse than I was.
Nights are absolute horrors for me and I expect even worse for my wife!
I am beside myself because I do not know which way to turn and I have no one to talk too.
As I write this, I have rear in my eyes.
This disease is winning.
And I am at a loss to find a way to fight back.

If you live in Virginia and you have a loved one, or you, need Memory care, the Memory Center in Virginia Beach and Richmond look like great places.
I emailed them today, and I received a return phone call before my email stopped vibrating on Kathryn's screen in Virginia Beach!!
She was very informed on Dementia, cared about me, or she is a GREAT actor, and even gave me her personal cell number.
No, I do not work for them and they do not pay me!!
But, I do know a good thing when I see it.
The Memory Center uses the newest research to provide a home for those of us who have Dementia.
A facility that looks like a town, with residences in neighborhoods, segregated by cognitive ability.
The are sending me information and I intend to visit this place this summer!
For me, to live in a place dedicated solely, to my well being, security, and comfort, as a Dementia patient, is worth just about any amount of money.
I will keep you informed.
But, if you live in Virginia Breach or Richmond, go check these places out and let me know what you think!!
I would be grateful for your insight!

I play Pool, 8 Ball, every Wednesday and Sunday night.
I am like many people in that I have good and bad days.
But, what gives me fits is I can make a number of difficult shots and then forget how to make the simplest shot the next time it is my turn.
The truth is, I cannot remember how I made the last good shot, no matter how hard I try.
And the harder I try the worse it gets.
I accredit this to LBD since I used to be able to remember simple things!
I know it frustrates the men who are unfortunate to be my partner.
And most of them deny that I have LBD!
So, I never mention it anymore.
Sometimes I would like to quit playing Pool, but, it is the only activity I participate in here.
And, I enjoy the fellowship.
But not being able to be even moderately consistent is frustrating.

Our son is on the road for work and called me to tell me about his rental car, as is our custom.
He has a Toyota Sequoia!
He likes it and I have always liked the Sequoia,  It is a tank!!
So, I got on line and built one.
Equipped the way I would want one, it would cost $65K.
Heck, I thought, I could buy a Toyota Land Cruiser for that and they last FOREVER!
Then I thought, The Land Cruiser lasts for a minimum of 20 years!!
I will NEVER get to the half life before I die!!
It wold be a waste of money!!
Having a terminal disease helps one spend their money very wisely!
No more skivvies to purchase and now, no new cars.
Heck, I am getting rich!!
Our money will last forever!
I always look on the bright side!

We walked over to the main lobby tonight, to drop off our monthly fee and some books at the Library.
Walking back, I told my wife, I no longer know who I am.
It is true, I feel as though the person inside of me is not me.
The emotions I have are strange to me.
I look at things that I know should be familiar, but they seem different.
I really cannot explain this feeling.
I can only describe it.
The one thing I do know is that LBD is the cause and my journey with LBD is progressing, faster than before.
I wish I had someone to discuss this with.
But, there is no one that has a point of reference.
Only outsiders.
This is where the loneliness of LBD comes from.
Another truth I finally understand.

It is interesting how some things illuminate where I am in my Life's journey.
Now, I know that I do not know when I will pass from this life to Heaven.
Only God knows that.
But, things show me the futility of life and the things we hold so dear.
Things that we will leave behind and have NO value to us, at all!
Tuesdays, I wash the towels, sheets, and underwear while my wife is ate her BSF Leaders meeting.
It is a form of multi-tasking.
In any case, I was folding my Skivvies and I realized, I will NEVER have to purchase any Skivvies again!!
Now, that seems like a strange thought to enter my mind and I certainly did not put that thought in my mind on purpose.
But there it was, big as day.
I will never run out of skivvies!!
I also realize, overtime I get in the passenger's side of our 2015 Subaru  Outback, that I will never purchase another car!
I love cars!!
We have bought somewhere around 20 in our 43 years of marriage!
But, this vehicle, is my last.
Maybe because it will last 20+ years!!
We spend all of our lives accumulating THINGS!
Things that break, rust, go out of style, become obsolete, or we out grow.
Things that we spend our hard earned money on.
Money that we spent our Limited time on earth making.
Time that we could have spent with our families, teaching our children God's word, helping the sick, comforting the grieving, and witnessing to the lost.
I am afraid I have spent the vast majority of my life on things that will mean nothing after I am dead.
All I can do, is work for God now, everyone HE gives me the opportunity.
And that is my vow!

Lately, I have experienced a reduced mental connection to everything around me.
People, the environment, television, and everything else.
I am in a fog, far away, and disconnected from what is going on around me.
Furthermore, I am not interested in those things.
Instead, I think about the Navy, about my experiences and even have day dreams about things that did not happen.
It is as if I was transported back into the Navy, in uniform, and on a ship, working as a Gunner's Mate.
Those day dreams are very pleasant to me.
It is interesting to me to see how my mind is taking me to a time when I was more in charge of my environment and my physical and mental being.
A time of professionalism and self-confidence.
It seems I am slipping the bounds of reality and moving into a more comfortable time of my memory.
No issue.
Just a report.

My Neurologist has increased my nightly dose of Nortriptoline to combat my nightly agitation anger, and aggression.
Tonight is the first night I have taken the new dosage because of my Wife's travels last weekend.
So, I am now experiencing the effects of the new dosage.
How do I feel?
Like I drank 6-8 beers, without eating, in a two hour time period!
I am not drunk, but I am relaxed, a little loopy, and fairly happy.
I feel like telling sea stories!
The really GOOD ones!!
I do not feel the agitation, anger, or aggression I have experienced for a long time.
Instead, I am seated, relaxed, and oblivious.
This is not too bad!
But the question is, will this be the effect every night, after I get accustomed to the dosage.
It is good to feel relaxed and not agitated.
Even at the expense of feeling half in the bag!
But, only time will tell the full impact.
But, I thought I would keep you informed.
Now, I am going to bed.
I hope the bed does not spin!!
I used to hate that sensation.
</doc>
<doc date=Thursday, February 25, 2016>
I have written before about the negative impact noise of any kind has on me at night.
But this morning, I experienced other noise issue.
We slept in today.
I was up last night from 1-4 AM  because of some cold symptoms.
So, I slept in.
At 9 AM the complex fire alarm went off!
Now our Fire Alarm could wake the DEAD!
Every room has an alarm in it.
And each one is very loud.
I jumped out of bed, got dressed, only to learn it was a test.
No notice!!
Now, if it was a short test, I would have been fine.
However, the test lasted 45 minutes!
Why someone needs to test an alarm for 45 minutes is beyond me!!!
In any case, I was getting more and more angry, agitated, disoriented, and overwhelmed.
But I did not notice it!!
Thank God my wife did and after 15 or 20 minutes, she took me outside to walk the dogs.
We were a block away from our building and the alarm was still loud.
If Linda did not see the symptoms, there is no telling what might have happened.
Additionally, I remained upset all day!!
This 45 minute fire alarm fiasco ruined my entire day.
But, we learned something.
When the alarm goes off, we are going outside!
Second, the time for me to be in a facility that caters to me, a Dementia patient, is coming very soon.
Linda softly brought that topic up this evening.
Her wheels are turning on this topic also.
I have had a fairly easy journey up to recent times.
But, the intensity of everything is going up, exponentially!!
So, we will work on future plans.
But the folks here are Azalea Trace are somewhat secretive about memory support.
So, I am going to see the Director of Nursing tomorrow and get some straight answers, one way or the other.
I will let you know what happens!

Being a LBD patient that is still able to understand what my wife is dealing with, I see the difference in prospective we both have about life.
Now, I am not sure how long I will have this insight in that the speed of the progression of my LBD has increased.
There are times, now, where I not only cannot see her point of view, but I am angered by her point of view!!
So, my prospective of my future life is very negative!
I have recently began to feel my life expectancy is very short.
Because of that, I do not have goals, a list of things to do, or any reason why I should save anything for a future that I will not have.
I want to do what ever I want to do with my time, without notice, planning, or reason!
I want to eat what I want, sleep when I want, and do what I want.
I realize this must be maddening to my OCD wife.
She, on the other hand, has a long term plan, long range goals, and is willing to wait for things to happen.
I am sure she gets frustrated over my prospective on life.
But, some of that frustration comes from her inability to see my prospective.
What can't she see my prospective.
Because she loves me and wants me to be alive, with her, forever.
But, the truth is, my perspective is more realistic.
Another issues is, I would be more comfortable in Assisted Living where they provide all three meals, my meds, and we still have a private apartment.
But, my Wife believes that environment would stifle her, and she may be correct.
So, we live with these opposite perspectives on life.
If you are a LBD caregiver or patient, you will have these fundamental differences.
The goal is to manage both perspectives and keep peace in the family.
The caregiver most likely had the best perspective, seeing that they will most likely survive the LBD patient.
But, the caregiver also needs to understand the perspective of the LBD patient.
In my case, I am worn out, in pain, and I mentally diminished.
Much of the time, I feel like I am not here.
And, that coupled with my perception that my life expectancy is short, changes how I see life and what I want to do with my life.
And doing things for the sake of doing things, is off my plan.
I need to close this post now, because I am loosing track of my thoughts and emotions.
It happens, often.

Days and nights are getting much worse.
Everything agitates me, even my wife's talking!
The dogs wanting out or even wanting petted causes me agitation.
I am becoming more and more reclusive and I truly do not like being around people.
I seek a quiet life of solitude and this is getting much worse.
My memory issues are also increasing.
Every Tuesday, I wash the sheets and towels in advance of house keeping coming.
Today, I got everything done and then called Jerry, as I always do on Tuesday.
After our call, I heard a noise coming from the utility area.
So, I went to investigate.
I noticed the booster fan for the dryer exhaust was running.
I immediately got angry because someone had left the dryer exhaust booster fan on, wasting electricity!!!
You guessed it.
It was me.
And the sheets and towels were still in the dryer!!
I truly and honestly thought I had folded them and put them away!!
Also, hallucinations are becoming more frequent.
I am having more issues with Blood Pressure and body temperature levels, and I am presently on the diarrhea track, verses constipation.
All in all, I really feel worn our, disoriented, and angry.
Why, because every thing that can happen with LBD, IS!!
Will this subside a little?
Maybe, Possibly, or not.
I just do not know.
And that is the unpredictability of LBD!

I said in my last post that I mainly sat in my recliner.
I also never turned the television on all the time I was alone.
Tonight, the television is on and I am more agitated.
And the usual political programming was on most of the daylight hours.
I slept most of the afternoon.
I have also said before that I believed I would do better in a more controlled environment like assisted living or a memory care facility.
That being said, I do OK when my Wife is with me and we consciencely control my environment.
So, a move to assisted living can wait.
But, the weekend experiment did illuminate how television influences my agitation and anger.
The constant bombardment of violence, political dribble, and extra loud commercials, is not good for me!
I thrive on quiet, calm, and routine.
That was reinforced the weekend.

I have written before, I think, thanking each of you who read this Blog and for the comments you send me.
These comments connect me to the LBD community.
If we are connected, we are stronger, and we can help each other deal with this disease.
You comments help me ad I read them over and over again.
Unfortunately, I cannot reply to your comments because the program I use for this Blog does not permit that.
So, from time to time I write a think you, in this manner.
I have a new reader, who has read every post I have written and provided me with numerous, reinforcing, heart felt comments.
I truly appreciate your inputs Edd.
You have encouraged me in some of my darkest days of late!
I believe we need to support each other in the LBD community.
We have little outside support and even our doctors are of little help.
I am grateful that my neurologist has finally become a supporter of mine.
And I am blessed to have an psychologist that cares.
But, it has taken a long time to build this support group and I realize some of us NEVER have medical or even family support.
I worked with a fellow whose Father had Alzheimer's.
The Mother, the wife of the Alzheimer's patient, never got past the "Anger" stage of grieving.
One day, she was berating the husband, and my friend was standing with his Father.
The Dad asked my friend; "Who is that woman?"
My friend said;  "Your wife!"
The Father replied: "NAW!!"
I am blessed with a wife that cares for me and doctors that have finally got on board.
But, with out people like Edd, this would be a lonely journey.
Thanks, to all of you!!
And as they used to say on Television;  Keep those cards and letters coming!

When I was in the Navy, I did everything I could do to be the consulate professional.
I was strong, brave, or stupid, your choice, and I had almost total recall of technical information and sea stories!
If there was a risk to be taken in the gun mount or on the ship, or even on Shore Patrol, I was the one that took the lead.
I would rather risk my life rather than someone else.
That was just me.
But, sometime during the second decade of my Civil Service career, after 30 years of Naval service, (20 in Uniform and 10 in Civil Service), I started to notice my previously total recall memory being reduced and limited.
Finally, I had to retire on a disability because I mentally could NOT do my job anymore.
Since that unplanned, untimely, retirement, I have been on a down hill slide, mentally and physically.
My muscle tome has greatly diminished and my stability walking is greatly compromised resulting in numerous falls and near falls.
But the mental decline has been the hardest for me to deal with.
I cannot remember Bible verses or even where to find them in the Bible.
My memories of people of my past, even relatives, and events of my life are fading.
These mental and physical declines have resulted in me loosing my confidence.
Again, back in my Navy days, as a Gunner's Mate and a Chief Petty Officer and above, I was totally confident in my abilities in ANY situation.
Now, I don't even like to leave the area of Azalea Trace.
I am uncomfortable in the car as a passenger and very jumpy in traffic.
And I am extremely uncomfortable in the dark, in a car, walking outside, or even in our apartment.
Travel is unnerving because I am in an unfamiliar situation and out of my routine.
And routine is key to my mental comfort and calmness.
I have written before that I feel diminished before.
But that has progressed to a feeling of total dependence on my routine, my familiar surroundings, and a quiet environment.
even the cellphone ringing causes me to jump and feel a shock bolt through my body!
This loss of confidence in myself and my abilities along with the actual loss of my mental and physical abilities is the most depressing issue I deal with, as I am sure it is with all who deal with LBD.
Is there a fix?
No!!
No drugs or counseling will help.
How can I say that?
Because I have tried both, numerous times.
No, this is here to stay, and most likely to get even worse.
My only hope is, the mental decline will speed up and I will no longer know I am mentally and physically compromised.
See, LBD does have some positive attributes!

I cannot tell you how emotional it is for me that the neurologist I see finally greed that I had LBD!
Dr. Bowles in Norfolk, Virginia and the University of Virginia saw it and diagnosed LBD.
But, still, since we lived in Pensacola, this is the first time I have had agreement from my now, only neurologist.
Now, I don't have to do the kabuki dance overtime I visit him.
What a relief.
I was tired of the fight.
An appointment ago, he moved my legs and said: "Your legs are very stiff."
I wanted to say; "no shit Sherlock!"
But it was early in the day so I could control myself.
Now, he freely admits all my issues are from Lewy Body Dementia.
I feel relieved, vindicated, and free!
So, from now on, the neurologist and I are on the same sheet of music.
Nice!
Of course, this journey is headed towards the end.
I am past the crescendo and headed towards the finale.
Even my wife admits that, in her own way.
But, I am at peace with my life and happy now.
My fight for recognition is over.
This is the best I have felt in a long time.
Funny how other people's attitudes towards me impact how I fell about myself.
So many people told me I was not sick and I have even been told I was faking it!
I knew I was impacted by LBD, but I could not convince outsiders and even the first neurologist I had when we moved to East Lower Alabama.
Now at least, my neurologist agrees with my doctors in Virginia and as far as the outsiders go.
Well, they will just have to remain outsiders to me.

<doc date=Thursday, February 11, 2016>
Today was one follow up visit with the neurologist.
You may remember, he ordered a MRI on my back to see if there was any mechanical issues causing my leg stiffness and my walking issues.
As I thought, there was no mechanical issues.
I do have arthritis and some disc protrusion, most likely cause by my career as a Gunner's Mate.
Moving thousands of rounds of ammo has that effect!
He is going to up a prescription I take at night to help with my anger.
I openly discussed my anger issues with him and brought out the time this week I made a fist towards my wife!
That was hard for me to express because I had not told Linda and I know it medically marks me as possibly violent.
But, it is the truth!
SO it needed to be out in the open.
But the most striking thing about this appointment was caught by my wife, not me.
She said: "Did you notice the doctor did not try to tell you you did not have LBD?
Instead, he said these issues were part of the progression of the LBD."
While that might be disconcerting to some, It is a answer to prayer for me.
No more fighting to justify my symptoms.
Now, the neurologist and I are on the same page.
That has been a long time coming.
Now, all three of us admit my LBD is progressing faster.
This permits us to address things in a more realistic manner.
I am happy.

Every Tuesday, Jerry and I talk for an hour.
Truthfully, that is the best hour of my week.
Jerry is the only friend that I talk to on a regular basis.
Others call occasionally and I appreciate their calls too.
But Jerry and I have a Tuesday appointment, every week.
I can tell Jerry anything.
He is a true friend and confidant.
These calls are a mental release for me and I hope he gets the same impact as I do.
There is no one that I trust more than Jerry.
As the Bible verse says, He is closer than a brother.
Since we have lived here at the CCRC community, I have made man acquaintances, but no real friends.
I may be too Enlisted or too opinionated for them.
Too bad for them.
I am not about to change any time soon!
So, as long as the telephone works, I will survive, because of Jerry, being there for me.
Thanks!

"Spotlighting" is a common issue with Lewy Body Dementia patients.
Understanding "Spotlighting" is very important for the caregiver and people that are friends of LBD patients.
For the uninitiated, the question is; What is "Spotlighting"?
Simply put, there are two of me.
I have two personalities at any given time, depending on who is with me, what is happening around me, and where I am.
In my home, with my wife, only; my symptoms come to the forefront.
When a friend or another visitor is in the apartment, I feel the requirement to be my best.
Now, the secret of "spotlighting."
I am no better, no more alert, and my cognitive skills are no better when I am "Spotlighting".
I just hide my symptoms!
I am still lost, confused, angry, and agitated.
I have read on other blogs that LBD patients exhibit "Spotlighting" during doctor's visits, to the dismay of the caregiver.
I try very hard not to do that, since Neurologists are so unbelieving and skeptical of LBD patients!
Another thing that induces "Spotlighting" is tension, at least in my case.
When there is an issue, argument, confrontation, I become very soft, apologetic, and respectful, to the people around me.
That is directly opposite of the way I was before LBD.
Remember, I am a Master Chief Gunner's Mate and being quiet in the face of a serious situation could be your death.
I had to be in charge, and no one could question that!
And they never did!!
But, now, LBD and spotlighting, turns me into Melvin Milk Toast, when things go wrong.
But, inside me, everything is churning, on fire, and angry.
Why do I react this way?
I believe it is a self-defense mechanism.
I do not want to loose the limited amount of freedom I have.
So, when your LBD patient acts totally different when his friends come to visit, don't get angry.
Just enjoy the time.
He will go back to normal after the visit is over.
I walk around Azalea Trace and take to people, smile, ask them how they are doing, and even comment on how they look.
People tell me I do not show any symptoms of LBD and I must be wrong in the diagnosis.
I am learning to accept that attitude.
They don't see me when I am not "Spotlighting".
Another interesting thing.
Early in my journey, when I was still working, a good friend that really was the BRAINS of the branch I managed, noticed the changes in my mental abilities.
After I was granted my disability retirement, Don told me, he noticed my symptoms very early.
Then he listed all the symptoms he noticed!
Don and I were very good friends and I was very comfortable with him.
So, I never "Spotlighted" around him.
One other point.
"Spotlighting" is not voluntary in the case of the LBD patient.
We do not turn it on and off.
We are not in control of it.
Instead, it is a symptom of the disease.
Instead it is a sub-conscience action that I cant understand.
But, I have read enough from the medical world and from other LBD caregivers to help me understand that I am normal in my "Spotlighting".
So, the next time your LBD patient acts normal when the grand kids come over, be patient.
He is not in control of his "spotlighting" anymore than he is in control of his fluctuating Blood Pressure.

I have written before that I dread good days.
The days that I feel good, almost normal, and that things seem to be going better.
I had a few of them this week, two or three days of feeling pretty good.
I knew I would pay for them, in Spades!
But, those good days fooled me.
Then today dawned and I realized it was payment day.
My wife had a number of chores planned for today.
We needed to get the car ready for  trip she is taking so we had the car serviced at the Subaru Dealer.
Then to the Vet for some heart medicine for Marcel, the to the pet store for food, and then to Walmart for some other things.
The Vet's office was FULL of barking, sniffing, loud, dogs.
Old dogs, puppies, big dogs, small dogs, and all the excitement that comes with them.
The pet store was having an adoption event!!
More excited, loud, barking dogs and more people than I ever want to see gain!!
We came home and I took a nap.
Now, my wife is intently watching the Republican Debate and I am in the office, listening to Gospel music on my earphones.
I am overwhelmed with depression and anger.
I cannot figure out tomorrow.
I have no thought process that makes sense!
One minute, I desperately want to move back to Virginia Beach, the next I want to move into Assisted Living.
Then, I want to move to a memory support unit.
Next, I am thinking about buying a house!
See what I mean?!
I used to have a very logical mind.
Step by step planning that made logical, budgetary, sense.
Now, I am lost in opposing thoughts.
This truly is a maddening disease and I now, officially, hate it.
I am truly lost inside my own mind!
I do not discuss these disconnected thoughts with my wife.
She would be overwhelmed with them.
I have no one to talk to here at Azalea.
My Pastor is a good man who truly tries to help me.
But, he is young and knows little about LBD.
And, he is busy with a growing, young, congregation!
So, we get together for lunch every couple of months.
I cannot and will not ask more of him.
That little rabbit trail shows my wandering mind.
But this will really illustrate my lostness.
My Brother died 23 December.
But, every couple of days, I want to call him.
Then, it hits me, again, Sonny died!!
And the emotions of his death, and the death of my parents and shipmates run over me like a train!
Today, I got my Fleet Reserve Association magazine.
I always read the obituaries.
For the last 20 years, I have seen the Obits for old shipmates.
Today, it hit me;  There was no one I knew!
Why because they mostly are all dead.
I still have Jerry, Doc Wolf, and Dave Flippo, thank God.
This has been a tough day and I hope this disconnected post illustrates that.
I think I will listen t George Jones for a while.
He died too.

As Christians, we are cautioned to not become part of the trappings of this world, which is controlled by Satan.
Instead, we are told we are sojourners, living here temporarily, and headed to the place Jesus has prepared for us.
We are told to store up our treasures in Heaven.
I have known that for a long time and I have earnestly tried to live my life that way.
But, you know it is hard.
We want nice homes, good cars, Careers that pay well, and stylish clothes.
We want our children to go to good universities and we look forward to long, happy, retirements.
I certainly have sought after those things through my life.
But now, being in the place LBD has placed me, I can truly say, I am not of this world and I am heading home, sooner that later.
Now, don't get excited.
I see LBD as a blessing and not as a curse or punishment.
For the first time, I truly do not like or want to be of this world.
I see all the sin and evil in the world and I long to be with Jesus in Heaven.
Yet, God still finds jobs for me to do.
People I need to witness to, preaching that need done, and times for me to just be friendly to people that do not have anyone to talk too.
I treasure those Godly assignments and I seek them out.
But I no longer seek out what the world has to offer.
I do not watch the news, pay attention to politics, or get excited about the direction our Country is going.
I can't change any of those things and they do not impact my present life or my eternity.
My LBD has progressed, faster than before.
I now shuffle when I walk, even though I tell myself not to.
I am more introverted and detached from the world and even people around me.
I do not want the latest new thing, style, or taste.
I am pretty much satisfied where I am at the moment, knowing that the future holds beauty I cannot even fathom.
I spent hours in my chair, in another thought world, or mindless playing solitaire on my IPAD.
I take long naps and go to bed early.
Even the sports I liked hold little interest for me.
For instance, I once was a BIG NASCAR fan.
Now, I seldom watch the race on television.
Those thing just do not hold my interest anymore.
I know the Alzheimer's drugs are loosing heir impact.
But, they kept me going for a long time, so even that is encouraging, not depressing.
This world is NOT my home.
I know that now, more than ever.

I have said before that I use my two Miniature Poodles, old as they are, to tell me if my hallucinations are real or not.
Well, tonight is the second time my hallucination QA check failed.
I was walking my male senior citizen poodle and he was doing his business.
When out of the darkness, I saw something like a cat or ground hog coming at me, FAST!
Since Marcel did not bark, probably because he had his back to me, I got ready to club the attacker with my cane.
Then, the attacking mammal was not there.
Obviously, a hallucination.
These events are happening in more realistic and more often manner.
I guess they are just an indicator that things are progressing.
Oh well.

<doc date=Wednesday, January 27, 2016>
I know I have said this before and NO, this is not a repost!
But it seems, no one hears what I say or they just do not care.
Every time I describe a symptom or issue that I am experiencing, everyone, including my wife says;  I have the same issue.
But mine is different or worse, or more annoying, or better than yours!
Can you see why this is upsetting to me.
My wife says I don;t tell her about what I am experiencing.
Why should I, she is experiencing the same things I am only worse.
Hell, I am not sick according to anyone I talk to!!
Even the Neurologist I see here in Pensacola found out for the first time last visit, that I have issues with stiffness in my legs!!
I have been telling him about that for two years in writing and verbally!!!
Then, last visit HE DISCOVERS I have stiffness in my legs!!
Big revelation!
Look, it is obvious no one thinks I am sick, so, from now on, I am NOT sick.
I am going back to driving and work.
I am going to move out of this place and get a single family house.
I will mow the lawn, paint rooms, fix plumbing, and what ever.
Then, when you find me dead, on the floor or in bed, or in the back yard, you can say, maybe he had something wrong with him!!
Then you will say; Nah, he is faking being dead!
I should be laying there, I fell bad!
I have the same issues he thought he had, but didn't.
But, the bottom line is, I have nothing else to say about my disease.
I am well, no issues, I have never felt better, and everyone else in my life is the sickest person in the world.
I will dedicate my life to taking care of them as long as I live.
I really an fed up!!
PS:  After looking at my earlier post and this one, I can honestly say, the only thing I have in my life is m,y disease, LBD.
And no one is interested in that.
When I could physically do things for others, I was interesting.
Now, I am nothing.

Obtaining a definitive diagnosis of Lewy Body Dementia (LBD) is difficult at best.
LBD is the second most common type of Dementia, after Alzheimer's.
Yet, it is often missed or misdiagnosed as something else including Psychiatric issues.
I recently found a test called "The Lewy Body Composite Risk Score (LBCRS)" developed by Dr. James E. Galvin.
This teat is quite sensitive to suggest that there is a high probability that you have Lewy Body Dementia.
Of course, only an autopsy will confirm that presently.
I also learned that Lewy Bodies are being found elsewhere in the human body causing  issues like constipation and skin disorders.
Since I have sever breakdown of my skin, all over my body, I found this very informative.
I am not a doctor or a research scientist.
And I do not claim to know much about their process.
But, this study is interesting and I recommend you share it with you Doctors, both GP and Neurologist.
It may help and it can't hurt.
PS;  I scores a 10 on this test!

We play Billiards every Wednesday and Sunday night here at Azalea Trace.
From 6-8 PM, the two pool tables are very busy with teams playing 8 Ball.
Most of the men are older and BETTER than I am.
Some of the men are excellent and consistent in their game.
Some of us are novices at best.
But, it is a fun and relaxing time of fellowship, stories, and mutual respect.
I truly love and look forward to our Pool nights.
One issue is memory.
Most of us have memory issues with me being the one with the most memory loss.
There are always questions like; "Do we have stripes?"
half way into a game!!
I have actually used a stripe ball as the cue ball, buy mistake!!
And no one told me until after I made the shot!!
But, it is fun and relaxing and a level of social relief I have not had for a long time.
This is truly good living.

Let me tell you about something that happened here in the Retirement Community that we live in.
Then, let me tell you how it has impacted me and how I react to people like this.
A week ago, or so, we had a couple come and eat lunch with us.
The woman is in my Wife's Bible Study and her husband was on the USS Caron (DD 970) with me.
I had not seen him in 25 years at least.
While we were waiting for the dining room to open, we sat on some couches and chairs outside of the dining room.
My wife had me move one chair to make it so all of us could sit down.
When the dinning room open up, my wife told me to put the chair back where I got it and I was doing that.
I was pulling the chair, with me walking backwards, very slowly.
I did not notice that a small lady, with a walker, was behind me and I bumped into her.
I did not knock her down or even cause her to falter.
I immediately checked to see if she was OK and I apologized profusely.
I explained that I did not see her and I was genuinely sorry.
She began to berate me like I was a elementary school student!
I apologized again!
And she told me I was an idiot and that I better learn to watch where I was going!
After everyone was seated, I was feeling very bad for bumping into this lady and obviously startling her, so I went over to the table her and her husband, who I know, were sitting with another couple.
I again apologized.
She again flame sprayed me!!
Her husband just smiled at me.
Now, the lady that was sitting with the ungracious lady gives me the evil eye, will not return my wife's or my greetings when we pass in the hall.
Now, how this impacted me.
I am an enlisted man.
I worked with my hands, worked long hours, went to war anytime there was one, and acted like an enlisted man.
I am not ashamed of who I am or what I did.
On the contrary, the Enlisted men of our Military are the ones that win the wars, fight the wars and clean up the messes Officers cause.
People like the two ladies I am having issues with think Officers are the best.
They think wars are fought in dress white uniforms, sharply pressed, and that the war stops precisely at 2 PM so they can have tea.
They believe only Aviators did anything of value and that they are the upper crust of our society.
And trust me, there are more Officers and wanabe Officers here than fleas on a dog.
I have never wanted to be an Officer.
I am PROUD to be an Enlisted man and a Master Chief.
I KNOW who did the work that won the wars, and it ain't Officers.
Look at the Medal of Honor rolls.
It is predominantly Enlisted folks!!
Doris Miller, Wayne Caron, and other enlisted men.
This class of snooty, uppity, pious, self centered jerks have always aggravated me.
Yes, I come from poor beginnings.
And this "Upper Crust" has pissed down my neck and told me it was raining all my life.
They never cleaned a Head, went mess cooking, manned a replenishment rig, handled ammunition, of put drunks to bed.
I really do not like people of this class.
Truth be known, I identify more with the Black workers that keep this community clean, operating, and identified as the Best Retirement Community in the South, than I do with the snooty, ungracious people like these two "Ladies".
Now onto the LBD effect;  The episode occurs at 11:30 AM.
My LBD was in check and I did my very best to be respectful, gracious, apologetic, and caring about her well being.
She was just the opposite.
I had been able to let her attitude pass, until that gray headed, snooty, bitch treated my wife and me disrespectfully yesterday and today.
Now, it is 1900 at night, and my social filters are non-existent and I would gladly give these women a class "A" Master Chief Gunner's Mate ass chewing.
Trust me, I can still peel the paint off a bulkhead with my verbal assault.
And my voice is still loud enough to wake the dead.
Why people, who are obviously in the same condition, and position as I am, try to elevate themselves at the expense of others is beyond me.
But, my mental ability to graciously deal with these morons is evaporating quickly.
Of course, if I loose my temper, I will be the one who looses the most.
I am painfully aware of that fact.
Where I am presently, in my LBD journey, I can still control my temper, most of the time.
But, that control is weakening quickly and soon, snooty women like these two and others who think they are the "Landed Gentry" of the world, are going to suffer my verbal anger.
Enough said, since I am very upset and agitated.

I have been in emotional turmoil for the last month or so.
My Brother passed away before Christmas, so that has impacted me also.
But, I have had feelings of my own mortality also.
Issues have arrived that have me concerned.
Issues like my body being able to regulate my blood pressure, temperature, and even my mental stability including hallucinations, feelings of abandonment, and troubles concentrating on today instead of my past.
Needless to say, it has been a difficult time for me.
Yes, I am seeing my Psychologist and he was concerned and made me come back in two weeks.
The next visit is this week.
He can't "Cure" my issue, but he can help me deal with them.
I am not concerned with my destination, but the process of death is frightening.
And, since I am as honest as I can be on this blog, I am being very open.
This is now the third day of me trying to write this post.
I realize, in theory, that all that is happening with me is due to LBD.
But, my mind says different.
And most of the time, especially late in the day, my mind makes me believe the issues are caused by people around me.
It is 9AM right now.
The sky is clear and the sun is out.
I am functioning pretty well.
That is why I am trying to write now, knowing that in a few hours, all that will change.
The other day we had friends from my past Navy days come over for lunch.
The wife is in a Bible Study my wife leads and they discovered both husbands were stationed on the USS Caron at the same time.
My wife had me move a chair while we were waiting to get into the dinning room, so all of us could sit together.
When the dinning room opened, I was trying to move the chair back to the original place.
I was backing p, pulling the chair and I bumped into an elderly lady.
Not hard, but I startled her.
I apologized profusely!!
This little old, pad of a lady flame sprayed me and told me I had better learn to look where i was going!
She yelled at me like I was a 5 year old.
After we were seated, I went over to her table, an in front of all at that table, including her husband, whom I know, I again apologized.
Again, she berated me as if I did this on purpose and I was some interloper who did not belong here.
I spent the rest of the afternoon in my bed!
Hiding!
I did not play billiards Sunday because I did not want to be around people.
She upset me that much.
Now, I should be able to shake this off.
But I cannot!
She should have been more gracious, but she wasn't.
Her husband tried to ease the tension but she was relentless.
And now, I am hold up in my apartment plotting my escape.
I am not logical anymore.
I am emotional and LBD have broken my social and emotional filters.
Jean Harlow said she wanted to be alone in life.
I understand her emotions on that now.
Much of the time, people are the source of my pain.

<doc date=Friday, January 15, 2016>
I am up late.
My mind is a whir with hundreds of thoughts.
Self pity and depression appear to be close cousins.
Sometimes, I think, nobody really cares about how I am doing.
What brings me to that conclusion?
A number of things, for instance: No one wants to discuss my disease!
They all just assume I do not have any disease.
They discount my issues or down play them.
Then, they change the topic.
Discussion LBD is important to me.
LBD IS my life, just like Navy was.
Few people call and virtually no one comes over.
Yes, I get some telephone calls from so my old friends.
And my best buddy, Jerry, calls me, or I call him, once a week.
We talk for at lease an hour and I look forward to that call all week.
Visitors, just don't happen.
People think, since I am relatively young, I am faking it!
I guess this goes with the first item, but I have actually been told, I do not have Lewy Body Dementia!!
I take these issues and deduce that no one cases about me.
I may be wrong, but it is how my mind processes these inputs.
But, then again, maybe people thing they can catch Dementia from me!!
As a note of interest.
Today, my Psychologist's Administrative Assistant called and wanted the address of my LBD Blog and the LBDA.org site.
I was impressed, since my Psychologist does not use a computer and did not know about blogs until I told him about them.
Still, I am curious how he will use this info.
Since I trust him, I am not worried, just happily curious.
LBD is a lonely disease.
And somewhat peculiar it seems.
I want to be isolated, in a cocoon, alone, with a locked in routine, that I control.
I do not like crowds and I am quickly overwhelmed by too many sensory stimulants.
But, I crave people that are interested in how I ma doing.
These issues seem to be in conflict with each other.
But, that fits with how my mind works anyway, i.e.
yesterday's post.
Oh well, LBD is a journey.
"And I have miles to go before I sleep."
But there are less miles than there were when I started this journey.
And for that, I am glad.

It is 2100 and I am agitated.
Tremendously agitated!
I am in the office, with my headphones on, isolating myself from the Republican debate.
The two miniature poodles have completely disrupted anything I try to do.
The want out, treats, petted, out, treats, whatever.
The dogs, it seems, are my job.
Now, the male is standing in front of me, staring at me.
It is no wonder I never get to relax.
I often find myself in a mental round robin of; "I need to retire!"
Then I think, I am retired!
But not in my mind.
Agitation is not caused by the dogs, people, politics, or anything else.
My agitation is caused by LBD!
I need to tell the neurologist he needs to give me something to deal with this.
I just read an article on this, trying to find a solution.
It seems, agitation is the norm.
I know that, but I have been reticent to take any more drugs.
I was gong to try bourbon.
It used to help me before LBD!
But, it probably would react with everything I take now.
Heck who cares!
If bourbon makes me feel better, why not?!
OK, my logic is off; I know that!
So is my sense of self preservation.
Feeling like I do, depressed, agitated, angry, frightened, disoriented, why not try bourbon.
OK, I have one reason, I don't have any and I cannot drive to the ABC store.
And, my wife won't stop at one for me.
I am in a mental circle fight.
I need to retire, I am retired, I want to drink, no I don't,  I want to move to my survival house, I want to be in Assisted Living!
Then, I price trucks online, and then realize, I don't need one because I do not drive.
I search for homes with land knowing I can't move there.
See!?
I cannot control these thoughts.
I cannot get out of this circular fight.
This is maddening!!
This is my mental world.
And I wonder why I am agitated.
Did I tell you my wife is OCD?!
Big Time OCD!
Like Monk, OCD!!
Today, she had to get her Passport renewed.
Why, I don't know.
We are not going out of the country.
Maybe she is and I was not informed.
In any case, she had lists upon lists for this outing.
Papers from the Internet, what if worries, and plans for every issue she could conjure up in her never resting mind!
Then, she explains every alternative to me in detail!!
I don't even know why she is getting the thing renewed!!
That would be like me renewing my driver's license.
Again, none of this should upset me.
It didn't before LBD.
but now, I am driven to distraction and agitated as much as a drunk sailor in a Subic Bay bar!
I know this from standing Shore Patrol in Subic Bay!!
Maybe I will just go hide in my bed.
But, if you are a caregiver of a LBD patient, look at my issue, and see what your loved one is dealing with!
Heck, I wish people related to me would read this post.
That need to know too.
But, maybe I will get some bourbon anyway.

My hallucinations have been increasing in intensity and realism.
Last night, I saw our female miniature poodle, on the bed.
When I reached out to cuddle her, there was nothing there!
That hallucination was very realistic!
She looked and moved just like our female pools.
I would have sworn that she was on the bed.
But, she was not.
That event has rattled me and my wife, who I told tonight.
The hallucination did not frighten me, and I am glad it was not a hallucination of something that did frighten me, because I would have reacted in a violent way!
It was that realistic.
What does this increase in hallucinations mean?
Probably, my LBD is getting worse, progressing, taking over more of my cognitive abilities, and finally, it may single another "Plateau Change".
I will just have to monitor this.
However, I forgot to tell my wife until we went to bed tonight, so my monitoring things is not the most accurate measure!
That seems humorous to me.
I am the only one who has the insight to observe the progress of the disease, and I am loosing my cognitive abilities to monitor what is happening to me!
Well, I used to say;  "This is a great disease.
You forget what bothers you!"
That is not the best outcome when I am trying to chart my progress.
More later, if I remember.

The Television series "NCIS" had an episode, a few seasons ago, that featured Bob Newhart as a former NCIS medical officer, like Ducky, that had retired and now had Alzheimer's.
The episode focused on the fact that the "Old Medical Officer" could not remember what he did or how important what he did was.
That episode touched my heart and emotions.
Mentally, I live in my Navy past.
Up to now, I have been able to clearly remember my Navy past.
Lately, I have had difficulty putting my Navy thought in order.
I am even forgetting my in-depth knowledge of the MK 42 5"/54 Gun Mount!
I also understand the idea of loosing the importance of what I did.
Don't miss understand me, I was not a hero, a great leader, or an exceptional technician.
But, as the GMG Detailer, a Command Master Chief, a Gunner's Mate, an Instructor at Gun School, I did the best I could and I helped may Sailors become better at what they did.
But, much of that is slipping away from me.
With that loss, comes a loss of my self-esteem!
I used to be able to do most anything.
Now, there is very little I can do because of physical and mental failures.
Once, while tearing down an old shed at tour Virginia Church, I cut the beam my ladder was leaning on!
Me, the Electric Saw, the beam, and the ladder all came down in a heap.
After that, my neurologist told me; "NO more power tools!"
Heck, I can't even perform sexually anymore.
So, you can see how LBD robs me, and others of their self worth.
My disease is progressing, faster than ever, and I am loosing who I was while I am loosing my cognitive abilities.
I used to say, this was an interesting disease.
No more.
LBD is rendering me impotent in life.
Thanks NCIS, for telling my story!

I have been having a difficult time.
I have slipped mentally and emotionally.
I was discussing this with my wife and I described it as; "Being in a room, with no doors or windows, I am completely trapped in this room and it is filling up with water!
I saw my psychologist yesterday because my wife made the appointment.
It was a good appointment and I felt free to discuss all that I am dealing with.
I do not feel better, but I do not feel worse.
He did make me a follow on appointment in two weeks.
Evidently, he believes I still have issues.
And he is right!
But, I am not sure a psychologist can repair what Lewy Body Dementia is breaking.
My ability to deal with anything out of the normal, any change, anything that goes against my idea of what is good and right, is gone.
I do not watch politics and I only watch the news in small doses.
I live in my own mental universe.
I have said my LBD is progressing and I now know I am no longer in control of my surroundings or emotions.
As they say, it is what it is.

I never have done well during the Christmas Holidays.
This year, was even worse.
Maybe the most difficult Christmas of my life.
I have been deeply depressed and upset.
I thought I was going to be OK and then my Sister called on 23 December and tole me our Brother was in the Hospital and not expected to live.
He died Christmas Eve morning.
He and I had just reconnected recently because his Wife is dealing with Stage 4 Cancer.
He and I had some great, loving, supportive, conversations.
I even had an opportunity to talk to him about Jesus and the relationship required with Him to go to Heaven.
I am sure he was Saved and I am sure he is in Heaven with Jesus, right now!
I miss Him and I know his family does also.
But, knowing this is a comfort.
My childhood memories of Christmas are not the sweet memories most children have.
Why, is not important.
I have been so upset, I made an appointment with my Psychologist for this Monday.
Also, I have tried to write this post a number of times since Christmas.
But it is difficult to describe how I am doing or why I feel like I do.
Before LBD, I had defensive ways to deal with this time of the year including heavy drinking.
But now, I do not drink, I pray.
And now, the disease has taken away my defensive ways and I am stuck thinking about the things that bother me, almost 24/7.
When I go to bed, my mind goes to the past, the difficult times, and where I am now, dealing with LBD.
Then, my mind goes to ways to run from this situation, but to where, and how.
I cannot logically deal with my emotions.
I do not see a future for me.
Well, except....

<doc date=Tuesday, December 22, 2015>
I saw a statistic that more people die during the Christmas- New Year Holiday that any other period of the year.
Stress is a major contributor to that statistic.
But, it is even more difficult for those who have Dementia of any type.
I have never enjoyed Christmas.
Even as a child it was terribly painful for me.
Not that I did not get many wonderful presents.
But that I always was aware that I was the only person in the room with my last name!
No one had to say that, I knew and it hurt.
I have never recovered or dealt with that pain and it had carried on through my life.
Now today, all my depressing thoughts are magnified by the LBD!
Then there are the new mental "boogie men"  that haunt me all the time.
Things like noise, the direction of our nation, my wife's compulsive nature, financial issues, and all my failures of the past.
Then there are the memories and thought of those who have gone on before us.
Our grandparents, parents, friends, shipmates, and school mates.
So, while stress is always with my, it is magnified manifold during this time of the year.
That super multiplied stress can be reflected in higher blood pressure that can lead to strokes and heart attacks.
Then there are suicides.
People with Dementia's of any type are much more susceptible to the mental breakdown that leads to suicide.
The hustle and bustle of the Christmas-New Year Holiday period is crushing for those with normal mental coping skills.
For those with Dementia, and I speak from experience, the hustle and bustle is crippling!
The other issue is that those without Dementia DO NOT UNDERSTAND what the Dementia sufferer is experiencing.
They bang and clang around, pushing their own agenda without respect or consideration for the one who is unable to deal with all the confusion and drama.
And, since those of us with Dementia, or at least me, are always trying to control they emotions because if we loose control, we will end up in a facility that limits our freedom to what we take in or coffee, we don't say anything about how things are impacting us, until we either explode or retreat into our safe room, whether that is a real room or a mental breakdown that leads to social withdrawal.
While I have not discussed this with anyone, and I do not want to either, I am experiencing issues with dealing with every one's personal agendas and drama.
Look, if something does not go exactly right, the world will not end.
Everything is fixable.
So why stress about things!
Your stress makes me incredibly upset, and I hold that in!
I have said before that I had entered the Second Half of my LBD journey.
I need to add to that and tell you I am late in the Third Quarter.
Linda and I have seen a number of changes and symptoms getting worse.
I am experiencing more instability.
My emotional roller coaster is not off the chart.
Even though she sees and observes these changes, and she does understand them, the still lives in denial!
She loves me and wants me to be me, forever.
To think in any other manner for her is inconceivable.
I love that is her and I understand her emotions on this.
But, the truth is the truth.
So, while this is a bumpy, depressing, time of the year for me, this one is exponentially worse.
I am not surprised.
I expected this.
But, that does not make is easier for me or Linda.
I don't know what else I can say.

My Daughter in Law, her Sisters, Janie and Suzette, and their Quilt Guild here in Pensacola honored me with a Veteran's Quilt today!
The quilt is simply beautiful, perfect, and I am sure it will keep me warm.
But, their unselfish, loving actions, the thoughtful presentation, and their warm smiles and hugs, will remain with me, strengthen me, and cheer me, all the days of my life and I wish to be buried with that quilt when the time comes.
Simply said, what they did for me means that much to me.
No words can ever express my gratitude, love, and admiration of these ladies, especially Juliette, Suzette, and Janie.
Today was a very special day!

Since we retired, we have had a steady run of income reductions caused by the Federal Government.
For instance, OPM overpaid me for a year.
I kept telling them, but to no avail.
Then, THEY discovered the overpayment and all the sudden I was a dirty no good!
They docked me half of my reduced to normal retirement pay for three years!
Last year, we moved into Azalea Trace.
It is a continuing care retirement community to provide for our future health needs.
We took the entrance fee money out of my IRA.
That counts as income, so, this year, we have to pay $700+ more in Medicare Part B payments because we made too much last year.
I appealed, stating that it was a one year spike and provided the required documentation.
The Social Security Administration said, tough!!
You have to pay the $700 increase!!
Then, there is my ongoing appeal with the Veteran's Administration.
An appeal that will most likely never end.
Or, will end without me going the compensation I believe I deserve.
So now, out monthly budget is in shambles!
And I am upset, depressed, and overwhelmed.
There is no representative to turn too.
Our Congressman is worthless.
His name is Miller and he has yet to help me in anyway or even answer any questions I have sent him.
And before you yell at me, I have committed this to the Lord in Prayer.
Much Prayer!!
And I totally trust God to provide for us.
In the past, God has enabled me to make the way ahead.
Promotions, pay raises, extra jobs.
Now, I am helpless!!
I cannot go get a part time job, or ask for a pay raise.
And the President has decided, through manipulation of inflation numbers, to deny us COLA's on Social Security or Military Retirement.
This is a difficult time for us, and for me specially.
I am at the weakest I have ever been in my entire adult life.
So, I am upset and lost.
Still, I trust God for everything.
So, I will rebound.
One way or the other.

In any endeavor, it is imperative to have a measure of success.
Sports teams have statistics like Batting Average or Win/Loss records.
It is good to measure where you were and where you are now.
It is the same in the journey with LBD.
But, I find it difficult to quantify the progression of my disease simply because I don't remember even when this started.
Yesterday, the Staff Chaplain asked me to stand in for him at his Thursday Bible Study.
He has been dealing with an upper respiratory infection for ten days now.
Naturally, I said yes.
In my preparation for that Bible Study, I was looking through some of my past Sermons and Bible Study notes.
I was shocked at the quality of studies I produced two years ago.
I know that because I always date my work.
The two year old studies were very well written, researched, and organized.
Surprising to me, they look scholarly!
Compared to what I produced for last Tuesday's Church Service for the Skilled Care folks,  my writing and research skills of today are child like!
I have not ever done a comparison of my Bible study work.
But, this look back clearly shows the progression of my disease on my cognitive processes.
The work of exactly two yeas ago is organized, concise, and logical.
What I did just this week has no flow and reaches no apparent conclusion.
I would have never though of doing this comparison.
It happened because of circumstances but to me, it is a very valuable measure of my progression in my journey with LBD.
I realize exact measures are difficult in Lewy Body Dementia due to the sine wave progression of the disease.
Yet, this comparison clearly shows a negative direction in my cognitive skills.
It also upset me and frightened me since I now can see clearly, where I was and where I am now.
In addition, it casts a dark shadow on where I am going and how fast I am going to get there.

Today, I have experienced gleeful emotional highs and now that the sun has set, gloomy, deep, depressed, emotional lows.
It is interesting to experience when you are experiencing an emotional high point.
When you feel like you are almost firing on all Eight Cylinders!
You feel great.
Life looks good.
You even make plans to have fun, visit someone, or do something you like.
Then, the pendulum swings and you are stuck in a pool of doom and gloom.
You do not want to do anything, talk, or be around anyone.
Noise is cutting, and you have difficulty finding the strength and energy to go on.
Many times, when I am experiencing the lows of LBD, I hide in bed.
The darkness of the room, the comfort of my bed, the warmth of the covers, make a cocoon to hide in.
Also, during these low times, all the other issues that LBD causes are worse, brought to the forefront, and amplified.
Tonight, I am having great difficulty focusing on anything.
I am foggy, disconnected, and unable to focus.
My leg muscles are sore, stiff, and my mobility is impaired.
As I wrote earlier, this morning I was very disconnected and had in my mind that I needed a telephone number to eat Raisin Bran.
Then the day got better and I was pretty much OK.
But now, I am again confused and conflicted.
This, in my opinion, is the most drastic portion of LBD.

Today, a very left will, liberal, progressive, member of our retirement community, who has NEVER had a job except academia, questioned me about gun control as related to the Presidency.
I calmly educated this single minded slob that the Founding Fathers put the Second Amendment into the Constitution to ensure we were citizens and not subjects.
In other words, if the President went off the tracks the populace would be able to dethrone the self imposed king.
I also educated him on the way the Founding Fathers did NOT include "Obey the orders of the President of the United States.." in the Military Officer's Oath of office but did include that in the Enlisted persons Oath of Enlistment!
The reason is the same as the reason for the Second Amendment.
They wanted the "Landed Gentry" that were and are the Officer Corp to be able to dethrone the self imposed king without violating their Oath of Service.
He then brought this, up to then civil, discourse to dethroning a President Trump!!
I said it applaud to any President including the current President.
This mindless follower of the Socialist Party named  the Democrat Party, then went on to repeat all the talking points of how Great the Muslim Emperor is!!
That was when my social filters failed, BIG TIME!!
We were in the pharmacy and the lady who staffs the pharmacy is a wonderful individual and a good Christian lady.
I did everything I could to control my profanity.
I am not sure if I succeeded because I was in a blind rage.
I spent 40 years of my life serving our Nation, doing whatever the Country's Leadership told me to do.
I offered them my experience, my opinion, and my abilities.
But, after the discussion was over, I did what I was told.
This pies of garbage did nothing for this Nation and has poisoned the minds of many young people.
But moreover, I am very tired of the direction the Puppet Masters behind the curtain are taking our nation.
I believe the majority of Americans are silent about how they think the nation should move.
And their silence permits this takeover of our country by individuals whose only desire is to turn this nation into a Socialist prison where only those in power live a good life and the rest of us are enslaved SUBJECTS to them.
Furthermore, I am tired of being quiet over my disgust!!
So, that coupled with my disdain for this jerk and my filters failed.
It took ,e three hours in bed this afternoon to even get me to a point that I wanted to get up or talk to even my wife.
Now, to the LBD issues.
I am loosing my ability to suffer fools and someday, very soon, my filter failure may be be even more drastic.
I try not to watch or listen to politics on the television but my wife insists on watching politics on television.
So, she is causing some of my issues.
I have always been a fiery, hotheaded, loud, individual when it came to subjects I where I was passionate.
I have a very sharp division between  right and wrong.
And I will fight to ensure what I believe is right will prevail, regardless of any loss I might suffer.
But, I also had the ability to curb my actions and statements when I knew other would be harmed by my actions.
Now, that filter is not there.
Maybe I will move to a small house on a big piece of land and be a hermit!

I wrote before that I read the article in People about Robin Williams' death as described by his wife.
She said he was having great difficulty  dealing with his perspective that he was loosing his mind!
I can identify with Mr. Williams on that point.
So many things have happened to me since I was first diagnosed with Lewy Body Dementia.
For instance, the incident when I was dreaming I was in a fight and I hit the fellow I needed too.
It turned out I hit my Wife, and drove her across the bed!!
Thankfully, she had her back turned to me, so I hit the back of her head!
It could have been much work.
That was caused by REM Sleep disorder caused by the Lewy Bodies messing with that portion of my brain that paralyzed me when I sleep.
Hallucinations are another symptom that are difficult to deal with.
I tell people I use my miniature poodles as my Hallucination Checkers.
If they do not bark, I do not worry.
But, truly, each hallucination bothers me because it reinforces my belief that I am loosing control or my mental functions.
Nothing in my life is as it was before LBD!
For instance, I do not drive any more.
We finally gave in and applied for a Handicapped Parking Permit.
I have difficulty finding words and conveying my thoughts.
I have stability issues.
The fun things of life are gone because either I cannot do them, or I do not want to do them.
I used to be a self assured professional who had the answer to most things.
I was in charge during very dangerous times with live ordnance on Navy Ships.
Now, the most dangerous thing I do is pass gas!!
Trust me, that is a brave thing to do for me.
Another issues in the thoughts that permeate my mind.
My thoughts move from Navy, to survivalist, to Assisted Living.
I can never keep a single thought in my mind, especially in the evening.
I truly do not have control of my thought process.
I have written before about the anxiety, anger, depression issues.
They also illustrate how LBD has taken over my mind and my life.
Mr. Williams decided to end his life because he could not deal with the loos of mental control.
I do not believe I will take that course.
Instead, I want to see this disease to the end, just because I am still interested in how this turns out.
Just the same, the loss of everything in my life that represented what and who I was has shook me to my core.
So, it appears Robin Williams and I were impacted by the same issues.
We just decided to take different paths to deal with them.
Sad but interesting.

This is my week of medical appointments made longer because my neurologist just woke up and found out I have Lewy Body Dementia and I have Stiff Legs!!
I saw him on Monday.
He was amazed at how stiff my legs were and how that stiffness causes me to walk with weird leg movements.
So, he has ordered an MRI to determine if there are any physical reasons for my stiffness and weird walking gait.
I could save him the effort and my insurance companies the expense of this MRI by telling them it is the disease that causes this.
If it were physical or skeletal it would have broke by now!
But, medical science is enamored with their electronic devices and so are the insurance companies.
So, into the tube I go, on Thursday!
Then, today I saw my GP, who I really like.
She truly cares about me and for me.
This appointment was a normal, 3 month check up.
All my blood work looked good, and we mostly talked about the progression of my LBD.
We spent a long time discussing the impact of anxiety, depression, and the feeling of being worthless that I deal with everyday.
I had read an article in People about Robin Williams and how Lewy Body Dementia impacted him.
In the article, his wife said he was afraid he was loosing his mind!
He was always suffering from anxiety and depression.
He saw hallucinations and had difficulty discussing his issues and the world as he saw it.
Heck, that is how I feel everyday!!
But, it was enlightening for me to read what he experienced and knowing that he and I walked the same path.
Robin Williams committed suicide n=because he could not deal with his issues.
I understand that.
And my GP went to great ends to explain he had mental issues all his life.
I know that.
So have I.
But I don not intend to commit suicide.
Just the same, as a person without faith in God, what did he have to loose except a tortured existence.
Oh well, tomorrow, I have nothing to do,  Thursday it is in the "Tube", and Friday Azalea Trace will keep me busy.
I think I need to go back to work to get some rest!

It is the Christmas season.
A part of the year that makes me more melancholy that happy.
Actually, I find Christmas and New Years depressing beyond description.
And the older I get, the worse it gets.
Christmas makes me think about my past.
My few successes and my many failures.
I think of old friends and Shipmates, most of whom are now dead.
Those thoughts bring back good and bad times.
But they were good times with friends that I depended on and them on me.
Those were great times that warm my soul.
I miss being a Chief.
The times in the Chief's Mess.
The fellowship, friendship, working together towards a common goal, and blowing off steam doing less than smart things!!
It was fun!!
Or at least, it was then.
I miss being dependent on fellow professionals and them being dependent on me.
I even miss the arguments that arose in the Chief's Mess about the most ridicules things.
I just miss being a Navy Chief.
I never really fit in the civilian world.
I tried it and I did not like it.
So, I went to work for the Navy as a Civil Servant.
There, I could use what I learned to serve the Navy I loved.
I screwed up when I retired from the Navy.
I got caught up in my own self-importance.
The most stupid decision I ever made was becoming a Command Master Chief and then a Force Master Chief.
It was not a fit for my personality, my career goals, or my happiness.
I remember looking in the mirror, when I was the CMC on the USS Caron, and NOT recognizing myself!!
I should have went back to being a Gunner's Mate then.
I remember the Bible verse that says;  "Pride goeth before a fall."
It certainly did.
Now, I am a broken, bitter, depressed, old man, without anything of value to do, nothing to offer, and no way to change my lot in life.
I dream about the Navy.
Every facet of the Navy life.
Sometimes I escape to my Navy life in my mind during the day.
I live in a wonderful Continuing Care Retirement Community filled with rich, landed gentry.
There are a few successful retired Navy folks here.
They try to act like like they are something else.
Folks like me call that "Uppity"!
I act like a Retired Navy Master Chief.
Hey, it works for me.
I never thought I would live this long.
I never thought I would have Lewy Body Dementia, and I never thought I would end up like this.
I failed myself!!
Yes, I succeeded, but that success did not serve me well.
I would give everything up that I have to be a Chief Gunner's Mate on a MK 42 equipped Destroyer type Navy ship, sailing in harm's way.
Instead, I am here.
I guess I miss my life the most.
That about says it all.

I truly have not been afraid of many things.
And, I learned early to never let anyone know what you are afraid of.
Giving into fear only paralyzes you and prevents you from accomplishing your goals.
I also have written before about my neurologist in Virginia Beach.
She was tenacious and dedicated.
She asked me if I had dealt with the reality of my disease.
Of course I said YES!
She immediately said; "No!
You haven't!"
and she was right.
As a matter of fact, even though I thought I had dealt with the realities of LBD before, I just now HAVE honestly dealt with these issues.
You see, I now know I am afraid to die!
No, I am not afraid of my destination after I take my last breath on this earth.
I am Heaven bound because of the Finished Work of Jesus Christ on the Cross!!
No, I am afraid of the process of death.
It is something I have never done.
So, I am afraid of the unknown.
And, since the disease has progressed to the point of completely dominating my life, I now realize what my Neurologist meant when she asked me if I have dealt with my disease.
I am going to die.
And not a long time from now, but sooner, rather than later.
If the disease progresses next year as much as it did this year, I will be in bad shape next year.
Not something I am prepared to deal with.
But something I must face head on.
Back to my management of fear.
I cannot let those close to me that I am afraid of this.
Yes, they now know because they read this blog.
But, that is why I am writing this.
Because I do not know any other way to tell them.
Remember, I never let anyone know I am afraid of anything!
So, there you have it.
This maybe the first time I honestly admitted, openly and honestly, that I was afraid.
Do I feel less of a man?
No more that Lewy Body Dementia had made me.
No, as I digest this, I feel better that I have openly said what I said.
Now I have to deal with every one's reaction.

Thanksgiving in my favorite Holiday.
It is the day I met my Wife.
It is a day my Mom and Dad ate Thanksgiving diner on the USS Stein (DE 1065) with my Wife and me after I came home from our Vietnam deployment.
Thanksgiving, if celebrated correctly, can connect us to God's intention for us that we live our lives being thankful to our Creator, for everything in our lives, and everything in the World.
From the simplest single cell organism to the most complex machine.
God created everything, for His Glory!
That is what Thanksgiving Day should be centered around.
This Thanksgiving, I am very thankful for God's grace in my life.
I have Lewy Body Dementia and it has progressed more this year that any year before.
On the surface, that frightens me.
But, taking a more prospective view, it has been a slow progression up to this year.
That is a blessing.
Yet, I know the disease will not slow down again, so this next year will be even more challenging.
Speaking of my days on Navy ships, like the USS Stein.
Recent discussions on this blog have discussed courage.
I have faced my experiences with LBD the same way I faced danger in the Navy.
Trust me, it is dangerous to be a Sailor on a Combat Ship of any type.
Ammunition, mooring lines, swinging water tight doors, hatches, and scuttles, moving equipment, replenishment at sea, all done on a ship that is rolling and pitching, with wet decks, many times in the dark, and all the time being tired from long hours on watch and longer hours doing your professional job.
The bottom line is, I chose to run, face first, into the challenges of the U.S. Navy!
I tried to never show my fear.
As I promoted into Leadership positions, gun mounts that failed to fire, broke live ordnance into large pieces and turned equipment designed to move heavy ammunition quickly into the gun bore into unrecognizable shapes, all became a normal part of my life.
But all of these things and experiences could be learned, improved on, and passed on to others.
My experience with Lewy Body Dementia is something I am trying to pass on to others.
But not to make them better but to make their experience better.
But, I cannot get better at having the disease or learn to do this better.
Instead, I have learned quickly that I cannot beat Lewy.
It beats me at every turn.
I have never been overwhelmed by something in my life like I am by this disease.
I always knew I would be defeated by LBD.
But now, I know, I have already lost.
That is where I am not courageous.
If I were, I would continue to fight.
And I did fight for the first years.
But now, I do not have the energy or desire to fight this disease.
I have no idea when God will take me home.
I do know He is in charge.
My life was planned by Him before I was formed in my Mother's womb.
Lewy Body Dementia was in that plan.
I will not try to change God's plan for my life.
I will try to serve Him as long as He enables me to.
When God is done with me, I will go home.

After my post last might, I sat in my recliner quietly, surfing the web, and slowly calming down.
My wife asked me how I was doing around 11PM and I said; "Better".
She then asked me what cause my issue and for some reason, I felt safe in explaining it to her.
She was very attentive and then she said;  "You have to tell me these things."
I told her that I never tell her because she would get upset at me.
She explained that if I tell her, she can try to change her behavior that is causing me issues!
That was refreshing, since I still have scars from the bite marks cause my previous statements.
I guess I will try to tell her when she is doing something that negatively impacts me, in soft, polite, manner.
I agree that she cannot change something if I do not tell her about it.
Makes sense.
Communication is always better than quiet brooding.

We seem to have a difficult time judging how much is too much as far as outings and doing things, for me.
For instance, we rode the bus to the Commissary today as we normally do in Wednesday.
Then, after putting the groceries away, I had physical therapy.
After that, we went  to a few stores to purchase some things to stuff a Samaritan's Purse Christmas Box.
On the way home, I became overwhelmed and extremely grumpy!
We ate dinner and then my wife started in on her immediate requirement of getting the Samaritan's Purse packed in the provided box.
This is not due until Sunday morning at Church.
But, for her, it HAD to be done right then and there!
So, even though I am mentally exhausted, I have to chew my tongue and do what she wants.
Peace is better than arguments.
After that, I wanted to go to bed.
But, I stayed up and I am finally relaxing after sitting here in my recliner for three hours, surfing the web, and ignoring everything around me.
Another thing is, my Wife's mind never quits.
She analyzes everything.
She plays the " What would have happened if" game and it drives me crazy.
Who cares what could have happened on a TV Game show.
I truly do not care and the constant mental exercise of reviewing things drives me mad.
Oh, and then there is the constant drone of politics on the TV.
I have told you before how that annoys me.
She just does not seem to understand how these things effect me.
I have told her and she reads my blog from time to time, so she knows how I feel.
I avoid things that annoy her.
Look, I realize, as most of you do, that I have real difficulties as the sun goes down.
And these issues are getting worse, fast.
This winter is my most intense sundowning time.
The things that effect me stay the same.
They have not changed.
So, why do I fight the same issues every night.
The bottom line is, I am difficult to be around because of LBD.
But, it is not my fault and I need help to even stay on a even keel.

<doc date=Tuesday, November 17, 2015>
Someone sent me a comment thanking me for being so courageous.
Nothing could be farther from the truth.
And if I portray myself as brave or courageous as I face LBD, forgive me, because I am scared to death!
Yes, I write about what is happening to me.
Why, because it helps me deal with my issues and I truly believe it may help others.
But, I am scared over the future.
That is one of the reasons I plan, project, research, and worry so much.
You don't see my tears or my fearful thoughts, especially at night when I am alone with my thoughts.
I was brave, or stupid, either one, when I was a Navy Gunner's Mate and we would have a casualty in the gun mount that would involve ammunition, ready to explode.
Then, my knowledge, training, and wits could help me survive.
Now, there is no survival.
Only a slow decline into oblivion.
And now I know, as I did when I was working around enough explosives to sink my own ship, that only GOD is in control of my life.
Me courageous?
Not really.
But I do helplessly depend on GOD for my future.
I recommend that plan for each of you too.

<doc date=Saturday, November 14, 2015>
I read and post almost every comment you send me on this blog.
Why?
Because there is GREAT value in what all of you have to say.
Many of you are caregivers and some are patients with LBD or another form of Dementia.
I have written before that we are a "Support Group" unto ourselves.
I hope you read the comments of others, they offer another unique, important, factual, point of view of this journey.
I borrowed from President Reagan when he told America he had Alzheimer's.
He said, he was involved in  "the long good bye"!
He was right.
But this is also a journey through many changes, valleys, mountains and storms.
Sometimes  we have quiet waters, but we know, soon a new storm will overwhelm us.
I have learned to embrace and enjoy the quiet times of this journey.
The storm will come again and I will not be ready for it.
So there is no need to be apprehensive.
You will never be ready to face the challenges and you will never be strong enough to defeat them!
That was the hardest lesson I had to learn on this journey!
And my Wife has not yet given into that truth!
She still thinks we can fight and win.
But, we cannot and in this case, resistance IS futile!!
Another comment from you that makes me feel good is that "You Believe that I really am sick'!
So many times, I have been told I am not sick, and many treat me like a fake or a malingerer.
I know you see this in your lives, but it helps me to receive your support.
Last week, my Wife and I had an emotional conversation about how I was feeling and doing.
I said I wished we had a support group for those of us with Dementia.
She went to the Nursing Administer here at Azalea Trace.
She really liked that idea and we spent about 30 minutes fleshing out this idea.
For instance, I would like to see, be in, and experience, the "Memory Support" area BEFORE  I am bad enough to move in there!
I want to meet the staff and get to know them.
They should NOT be strangers to me, but familiar people I trust.
This alone would make that transfer easier.
Another thought I had related to my Navy career.
Before each Deployment, we had a series of "Pre-Deployment briefings for the Crew and Dependents.
I view this journey as a Deployment.
So, why not provide me some Pre-Deployment training and familiarization?
I have made a larger that usual downward turn recently.
One reason is, I have quit fighting to stay normal.
I am now comfortable with myself and my disease.
There is no logical reason to spend energy trying to defeat a foe I cannot defeat.
I pray that God gives me an easy transition to Heaven.
That is my only request.
I have been having a rocky journey lately, because of the recent progression of this disease.
I am much more introverted and I stay alone as much as I can.
For instance, while I am in the living room with my Wife, she is watching politics on the Television and I have my Bose Noise killing Earphones on listening to Christian music.
George Jones, Vestal Goodman, Doc Wiseman, and other folks that appear on the Bill Gather tapes.
I am in my own, isolated, world, untouchable by the things that upset me, but still with my Bride.
Please keep your comments coming and I promise I will post as long as I can.
All of you are a blessing to me.
Thanks!

We shifted from Daylight Saving Time to Standard Time.
It gets darker much earlier and I get depressed, agitated, and grumpy, much earlier.
That early onset of my "Sun Downing" actually multiplies the effect because there is more time for it to act on me before I go to bed.
Then, I go to bed agitated, and that causes me to think negative thoughts that lead to difficult dreams.
I often get stuck in negative thought processes as I lay down.
Centering on things that might happen or actually have happened, that were or could be tragic.
I then get defensive, upset, and aggressive in my thoughts.
Not a good formula for restful sleep.
I have seen this increase recently.
So has my wife.
Short of more drugs, I do not see this improving.
I have written before about living in a Memory Support facility that isolates me from the outside world and controls my sensory overload.
That seems like a good, comforting idea to me.
Yet, I don't think I am quite there yet.
Soon, but not quite yet.
Yet, one of my nightly thought patterns is to run away from reality.
Either by hitting the road, becoming homeless, careless, and always on the move, or by moving into a facility that shields me from the things that upset me.
For instance, my Wife has the Republican Debate on right now.
Politics completely upsets and anger me.
Now, she should be able to watch anything she wants.
She likes Politics and wants to be informed.
I respect and defend that.
But, the fact is that I cannot deal with the tension, arguing, screaming, and tension of the Political Theater.
How do we deal with this?
I don't know.
But, I know as this disease progressives, I need to be isolated from things that aggravate me.
If we do not, I will loose control of my emotions and a melt down will occur.
I can write that now, not much later in this journey, I will act out this statement, without mental filters or emotional controls and that will lead to me being placed in a controlled environment.
More controlled than I would need if we took preventative measures now.
Just saying.

The circumstances of my birth, and the fact that people, alive, with hold facts about my Father and Blood related relatives is a great source of frustration and pain for me.
I have blood related brothers and sisters that will not have anything to to with me, even though they have NEVER spoken to me or met me in person.
I know my Mother was pregnant out of wedlock.
That makes me a Bastard.
I know that.
It is not my fault.
My birth Father, Donald Andrew Dolence, of Cleveland Ohio and his parents, my Grand Parents paid my Mother $10,000 to go away and never contact them again.
never saw any of that money and did not know about it until I was 31 years old.
Hell, I never knew my Mother had 3 other children, out of wedlock after me.
Yet, she blamed me for; "sucking the calcium out of her body that resulted n her having bad teeth."
Her words, not mine.
Look, I was blessed to be raised by Mom and Dad Mills.
They did so without compensation and never had legal papers on me until I was 16.
They did a magnificent job raising ma and I will be eternally grateful.
I was a success because of God and their teaching.
But, I would truly love to talk to people actually related to me.
For instance, what health problems did my Father have?
After all, he died at 63!
I don't want they inheritance, as if the Dolence family has an inheritance.
I just want a chance to know them.
Before Lewy Body Dementia, I had a thin=ck skin about this, at least on the outside.
It truly has always hurt on the inside.
But now, I am raw with emotion about o many things.
And this is one of the biggies.
I have a half brother, Donald Andrew Dolence Jr, of Westlake Ohio.
If you know him, have him contact me.
I tried and failed.
It is like I am a pariah or something.
You can see how things now get to me.
Or better, how I am now not filtering the things that ALWAYS got to me.
Good old Lewy Body strikes again.

Every night, after the lights are out, and I am in bed, I go through my dreams of a survivalist, concrete home, on 5, 10, 20 acres of land.
Solar power, garden, chickens, independent, and then it hits me, I am never going to be able to do what I used to dream, and I get very depressed, upset, and unhappy.
What I wanted, I will never achieve, because of Lewy Body Dementia.
I guess you could say I am too old for those dreams.
But, 64 is not old!
But there is no way a man with rigid muscles, and a memory like a screen door, who cannot sensibly read, hallucinates, and has sight issues, can live the survivalist life.
I know that!!
But my dreams used to still be there.
Now, my mind tells me I am foolish to dream about something my mind and body cannot do.
So, these dreams have been taken away from me by the reality of LBD.
No pills in the world can help with this depression.

I have written before, I think, that my Father in Law had Alzheimer's way back in the mid to late 1980's.
While his Wife was alive, he seemed, to those of us on the outside, to function OK for a man that was stone deaf!
She spoke loud, told him to do none thing a a time, and that seemed to work.
When she died, we all learned just how bad off he was.
The last five years of his life he lived either with us or in our vicinity.
We had custody of him and saw the later stages of the disease.
He was a tough old bird and he died of septicemia because the autonomic part of his brain failed and he is large intestine stopped pushing solid waste out of his body.
One thing I just remembered and the subject of this post is how his mind worked.
Every time we visited him, he would tell us how hard he was working!
I used to think; "Work, what work?!"
Now I know and now I understand.
I wrote before that my mind is always thinking, constantly running, on the thought pattern of; "I have to retire, I am working too hard, I need to put my papers in!"
Today, I realized I was in the same thought pattern as my Father in Law!!
He showed me what was to come for me so that I could understand it when it came!
Or better yet, God used Kurt to teach me what was coming and then brought it back to memory when my mind began to short circuit!
What a gift!!
To actually see the brain malfunctions of my Father in Law and then be able to apply that to my journey with LBD, lets me understand why I see life as I do and why my brain is doing what it does!
While I try to provide information others in recording my journey, GOD did the same for me, 20 plus years ago.
I cherish that knowledge and the path Kurt Herke blazed for me and now others that will read this post.
Thanks Kurt!
Note;  I would appreciate it if you would forward this post to anyone dealing with any Dementia.
Thanks.

OK caregivers, here is one of your most egregious faults.
Your LBD spouse has just done something out of his or her normal character.
It was really weird, or repulsive, or offensive, or immature, and your response is; "WHY did you do that!?!?"
or "Don't you EVER do that again!!"
From the LBD patient perspective, my reply is; "What?"
Because I don't know the thing I did was wrong in your eyes.
I do not see things as I once did and I probably never saw them as your do.
So what if I made a hat out of the Church Business Meeting agenda and I am now wearing that hat.
What's wrong with that?
I do not do crazy things on purpose.
They just happen because my brain is short circuited!
I do not want to warn your wrath.
I have spent 43 years trying to avoid that pain.
So, please, give me a break and understand that I act foolish, silly, crazy, and odd, because I just do not know what I am doing or that what I am doing is offensive.

I have had hallucinations from early on in my journey with LBD.
They have come and gone and came again.
I have always had all three types of hallucinations; Visual, Auditory, and Touch or Sensory Hallucinations.
For a while, they were all gone.
But, recently that have returned.
I have been experiencing visual hallucinations of small animals.
But, in the last few days, I have been experiencing Touch hallucinations.
The occur when I go to bed.
The dogs are in the bed, laying down, quiet.
I am just settling down and then I feel the bed move as if someone has sat on the edge of the bed.
Sometimes, it is as if someone is walking over the bed.
These pass fairly quickly, but they are disturbing.
Because the room is completely dark, I am the only human in the room, the dogs are asleep, and the bed moves!!
Some wonder why Robin Williams committed suicide over his hallucinations.
He had other demons to deal with because if past drug and alcohol abuse and the Lewy Body Dementia Hallucinations must have been overwhelming to him.
So, I CAN understand.
This is a signature feature of LBD and I have had to deal with it from the beginning.
Attacking Christmas trees, horses, crashing planes, cars, boats, people walking across the freeway, my wife calling me, beds moving, the feeling of someone touching me from behind, and ones I cannot remember.
This is becoming a problem for me.

<doc date=Tuesday, October 27, 2015>
My Wife is involved with Bible Study Fellowship and has met a lady whose Husband also has LBD!
This is monumental to me and as reported, to them also.
To actually, personally, know someone with LBD, that we can compare our journey with, will help all of us on this journey.
From what I have learned sofa, he is a little farther down the road than I am and has many of the same issues I have.
Just think, now, I have evidence that these symptoms are actually related to my LBD!!
Compare this to taking a car to a mechanic, trying to replicate the noise, symptom, vibration, with NO mechanical knowledge on your part and the mechanic is deaf and blind!!
That has been our journey up to now!!
So, it is my hope we can get together, learn from each other, and help each other on this journey!
I am truly enthusiastic about this developement.

<doc date=Monday, October 26, 2015>
It is interesting how LBD impacts my ability to control my anger.
I have aways had a "Healthy" anger.
I have always been able to "Spin Up" at a minutes notice.
And when I was "Spun Up" my anger was directed at the individual or individuals that caused me to be angry.
That all seems pretty normal.
Now, my anger seems to be directed within.
I tend to hold my anger in and do not scream, yell, strike out, or use profanity.
I do not threaten to harm anyone or take any aggressive actions.
Instead, all of this is directed inside.
Thus, there is no relief of the pressure and stress caused by my anger.
There is never any relief.
Some of this may be caused by a self defense mechanism in that I try to maintain a calm and cool exterior to prevent me from loosing my freedom.
I never worried about that before.
Now, they have something to use against me, my disease.
Some may also be caused by my total discuss with America, our so called, leaders, and the direction of our broken, defeated, country.
If I have my wish, I would live in a one room, cement cabin, on 20 acres, in the uninhabited part of South Dakota, alone.
People only anger and disappoint me.
Thank goodness I can hide in my bed, and I think I will.

A very good friend of mine, Jon Harner, sent me an article from NPR, dated October, 17, 2015, written by Jon Hamilton, titled; "Can A Cancer Drug Reverse Parkinson's Disease and Dementia?"
The article talks about a small study group of 12 patients given small doses of a cancer drug.
Many of the group had significant improvement in their movement and memory issues.
The study lasted 6 months and then was stopped.
After the stop of the study, that patients that saw improvement began to see their issues return.
I realize this is a very small, short, study.
But, it appears to offer hope.
And that is exactly what we need.
I invite you to read this study and pass it on to your neurologists and Family Doctors.

For a while, I have had a progressively worsening issue reading.
It showed up early in my journey as an on again, off again, issue and is now with me all the time.
I simply cannot maintain my attention reading anything over a few words.
And, I miss letters in words or swap them.
For instance, a Friend sent me a story about a Cancer Drug helping with Lewy Body Dementia.
But, I saw the title as a Cancer DOG helping with LBD!!
I though;  How can a DOG help me?
I already have two and while they are good companions, they cause me more issues than help!
But, it was a great illustration of how LBD impacts every part of my life.
And that impact is increasing, quickly.
I told my wife about the article and she wanted me to write about it to preserve it for future doctor's appointments.
I have also noticed my articles are getting shorter.
That is also related to this issue with reading.
My typing puts "Spell Check" to it's extreme level!
So, my friends, keep this articles about "Cancer Dogs" coming.
They help me greatly.

We have been going to Physical Therapy (PT) for over a week, maybe two, I am not really sure.
My legs still hurt in the evenings and I am still very stiff.
Since I have fallen twice in the past week, the Therapist is paying particular attention to my balance issues.
Today, she recommended I uses a walker when my left leg feels weak.
So, she has obviously isolated my falls to a weakness in my left leg.
It makes sense.
I have noticed a weakness in that leg myself.
Right now, I am sitting in my chair with my legs up, trying to rest after my PT session.
Stretching, crazy moves, and some leg presses have me tired.
Another issue surfaced to the Therapist that I have known for a while.
Stairs are not my friend!
Especially going down stairs!
She had me walking up and down stairs and I told her about my issues going down.
She looked like a light just went on!!
I believe the is all connected the Parkinson's side of my Lewy Body Dementia.
And, so it seems there is evidence that portion of the disease is increasing also.
No big deal, just another challenge to overcome.
I have another PT session Friday.
I wonder what we will discover then.
More later.

<doc date=Sunday, October 18, 2015>
I fell twice in the last five days!
That means, six senior citizens don't have to worry about falling the rest of this year!
No thanks necessary, I am glad to help.
The first fall came on an escalator in a department store.
I was getting on the down escalator, very carefully and holding on to the hand rail.
My left leg collapsed and I fell to my knee.
Tonight, playing Billiards, I made a shot and started to turn to walk around the table and my left ankle collapsed and I fell to my knee again.
This time I grabbed the pool table to keep from falling completely.
These falls are related to my LBD and things are speeding up as far as the progression of this disease.
Falling has become a major concern and I will be sure to discuss this at Therapy tomorrow.
Since falling is a prime issue for moving an individual to Assisted Living, the recent rash of falls concerns me.
Not that I don't like our Assisted Living accommodations.
It is just that it signals a major downgrade in my condition.
Oh well, we will see what we will see.
More later.

The answer to that question is....nothing.
When we were young, the next excitement was just around the corner.
Getting our driver's license, the Prom, enlisting, getting engaged, a vacation, buying a home, getting a boat, or a corvette, all very exciting life experiences.
But, what do I look forward too now.
I used to dream about the next adventure, not now.
When I close my eyes, I see nothing.
When I get up in the morning, there is no excitement, no hopes for a good day, and no promise of a brighter tomorrow.
The things I used to like to do either I cannot do or do not interest me anymore.
Heck, I don't even drive anymore and I LOVED to drive an automobile, pick up truck, big truck, motorcycle, anything!
Yes, I have some enjoyable experiences.
I enjoy billiards on Wednesday and Sunday evening.
I enjoy the opportunities God gives me to preach His Word.
But they come seldom.
I have learned, or better yet, observed, that Lewy Body Dementia is a life sentence in a prison made up of the confines of my mind.
And those walls that confine me are closing in!!
Slowly at first thanks to Named and Razadyne, but now increasing in speed.
Close and closer they close in, restricting my view of life itself.

I said recently I washing difficulty with rational thought.
One thing I did not write about is the thought that run through mu mind time and time and time again, everyday, day in and day out!!
For instance, I cannot tell you home many times a day, the thought; "I really need to retire.
I just cannot take this anymore!".
Or: "I need to put my Papers in."
I also repeatedly think about Navy issues like I was still on active duty.
Now, I have been retired from Active Duty Navy since 1989!
Why would I think about retiring from the Navy, time ad time again, everyday?
There are other repeated thought themes that I cannot remember as I write this post.
Imagine that.
It seems my brain is functioning less efficiently recently.
I believe the disease is progressing.
</doc>
<doc date=Tuesday, October 13, 2015>
Up to now, I have been able to "rationalize" thoughts and visions that I have had that really do not make any sense.
For instance, I saw a white horse with brown patches grazing in our back yard.
I rationalized it because I did not own a horse and our backyard was too small to support a horse.
Hey, it worked and the horse vision did not bother me.
The man walking across Interstate 10 in traffic was not as easy.
was sure he was real!!
Some of my thoughts have been the same, unrealistic and therefore I can explain or "rationalize" them away.
But now, I am beginning to believe my thoughts even though there is little or no evidence for them.
I am very reticent to answer email questions from blog readers.
Since I now fear they are gathering evidence against me.
I stay in our apartment most of the time, nesting, for security.
This is troubling for me and my Wife.
We discussed this last night since I wanted her to know I was beginning a new phase of issues.
She was visibly upset!
I apologized, but, the truth is the truth and I always want he rot know what I am experiencing.
You might be able to imagine where this issue may lead.
So, we are guarding against those issues and Praying that God will carry us through this storm.
Linda know what I am going through.
I have hid nothing.
But, LBD is becoming a mean, destructive, terrible life companion.
And I fear the worst is yet to come.

<doc date=Saturday, October 10, 2015>
It has been a tough day.
And tonight is even more difficult.
My life and how I live it has changes SO much in the last few months that I do not recognize myself.
It is true.
I looking the mirror and don't recognize who is looking back.
My mobility is becoming diminished.
We were shopping a day or so ago and I almost fell down an escalator!
Now, I was VERY careful getting on, held the handrail, and watched everything I did, but, my left arm gave way and collapsed and down I went!
Not far, but I went down on one knee and almost went over.
I have written before about how LBD has taken things from my life.
Physical things, mental things, that were important parts of my life, are now gone.
Or if not gone, so degraded they are no fun anymore.
Last night, we went to a Fund Raising Dinner here at Azalea Trace.
It was a wonderful evening with great entertainment.
I spent some time talking to a gentleman that I knew by sight and that had just moved into Assisted Living.
I did not know he had Dementia until he told me.
He and I briefly discussed our issues but I really am going to try to visit him for a longer, more in-depth, discussion this week.
I am more comfortable talking to Dementia patients than other people.
This post obviously has taken a couple of days.
I was so overwhelmed last night that I closed my laptop and went to bed!
But the intermission has reinforced my views of life with LBD.
Things I did, and took for granted, I can no longer do!
I am only 64 and I never thought these things would be lost to me at this young age.
I am going to post this, even though it is not complete or even cohesive.
But, it illustrates how disorganized my thought process is.
When I started writing this, I was upset, and had this article in my mind ready to write.
That went out the window somewhere.
It also illustrates my frustration and mental anguish over the losses related to LBD.
President Reagan said Alzheimer's was the Long Good By.
It is a Long Good By to those you love as well as to yourself and who you used to be.

I was sitting here thinking, as I often do.
No TV, no music, just silence.
I was reflecting on my Wife's response to my disease.
She has it difficult considering she is living with a ticking time bomb.
Unlike having a spouse that, while you understand they will die at some time, she is dealing with the realization that she is watching me die right now!
This topic came into my mind because the Chaplain here at Azalea is starting a Caregivers Support Group and my Wife was considering if she wanted to attend or not.
When I was on active duty, as a deployment approached, she became more and more distant with me.
Her view was, the sooner you go, the sooner you will be home.
I found that quite frustrating as a young husband.
Now, I understand it a little more.
And I truly do understand her mental status as a widow, already.
I also find it interesting that she understands my attitude, or "Fight" response may extend my life.
Last night she told me not to let my disease progress too fast.
Of course, I have little or no impact on how fast this disease will progress.
I am just along for the ride at this time.
And truthfully, I have little fight left in me.
I would just as soon have this over with!
Unlike her, I see this unending, ever increasing, fight to be exhausting, demoralizing, and tedious.
I am NOT the person I once was.
I have few of the capabilities that I once had and I find that fact frustrating.
Every single part of my life has been negatively impacted by Lewy Body Dementia.
But, I just thought I would share m observation with you.
That is why I write this blog.

<doc date=Monday, October 5, 2015>
We decided to ask my Neurologist for Physical Therapy (PT).
He sent a prescription to the PT group here at Azalea Trace and today was my first day.
Wow!!
Am I impressed!
The PT therapist did a one hour evaluation of my rigidity in my legs.
She put me through my paces.
But what impressed me the most was that she actually knew what Lewy Body Dementia was including all of the issues related to the disease.
Then, she engaged me in a conversation to find out how the disease was impacting ME!!
Double WOW!!!
I am very encouraged and I am looking forward to my next PT session on Wednesday.
I do not know if the PT will help or not, but the attitude of the PT staff has impressed me beyond words.
This is one of the main reasons we decided to move to a Continuing Care Retirement Community.
All the help we need is right here under one roof!

<doc date=Monday, September 28, 2015>
Tonight, I finally figured out what I want in regards to how people treat me over this disease.
I want someone, anyone, to sit me down and honestly, sincerely, ask me to explain how the disease impacts me.
How I deal with it, and anything else they can think of to ask.
I want them to ask these questions without that accusatory tone in their voice and without the attitude of; "You're a phony!!"
I am not being sarcastic.
I truly just want one person, to become personally interested in my struggle with Lewy Body Dementia.
Enough said.

<doc date=Sunday, September 27, 2015>
I received a comment from a Medical Student in the United Kingdom stating that she used blog to help her understand Dementia from the first person.
My Wife, who spends many thought-filled hours trying to dissect my disease, encouraged me to address some of my more pronounced hallucinations and relate them to what she believes may be their basis.
She also co-authored this post.
We know pronounced hallucinations are one of the main symptoms of LBD.
So, they are important in understanding this disease and how it impacts the patient.
For instance, I have written about my hallucinations of me being trapped by fully decorated and illuminated Christmas trees.
Each time, these Christmas trees surround me and prevent me from getting out of the room.
They actually impede me from going anywhere!
Now, let me unpack this in my Wife's analogy.
Until two years ago, Christmas was a very unhappy time for me.
I dreaded the Holiday!
So, Christmas trees represent all that is wrong in my life.
Therefore, I am being trapped by the things I hated from my past.
She also draws a correlation between this hallucination and a drop in my cognitive abilities.
I agree with that.
Or, the man walking across Interstate 10!
I was driving in moderate traffic on clear sunny day.
About 100 yards in front of me was a bridge that crossed the freeway.
I saw a man, as real as any man I ever saw, walking across the freeway, from one bridged abutment to the other.
When we got even with the bridge abutment I looked t my left to see where the man was.
My wife asked me what I was looking for and I told her;  The man walking across the road!
She told me there was no man.
Earlier in the week a man had been walking across a city street.
Did my mind bring that forward and place the man on the freeway this time?
Does Lewy Body dementia bring events from the past to the present - out of the context of current reality - but definite events that the mind processed prior.
Then, when we were back in Virginia, we went canoeing on Lake Wright.
Riding in the car, I saw a bright red sports car.
I do not now remember what kind it was, but it caught my eye and I was discussing it's virtues.
Then, when we were on the lake, in the canoe, I was startled by a red power boat close to us!
Power boats are not permitted on Lake Wright, so it was not there.
Again did my mind bring an interesting event from the past to the current reality - not really an hallucination but a past experience the "Lewy Body mind" puts in the present & doesn't realize it doesn't belong there.
Third is the plane crash.
One day, with my wife driving on a quiet residential street, I saw, clearly, a DC-3 flop over on it's back, presenting that unmistakable DC-3 belly and wide wings, and crash, nose down, not a mile in front of us!!
Now, I actually saw an A-6 with 5 external fuel tanks flop over and crash in front of me near NAS Oceana when I was the Command Master Chief at VA-55.
So, again, this hallucination may have been related to and actual life happening that the "Lewy Body mind" places in the present.
And finally, we were in an Eye Glass store.
There was a dirty, unkempt, homeless man hassling the receptionist.
She handled it well and the situation was defused.
Then, a few weeks later, we were back in the store to pick up our glasses and I was staring at a chair, where I distinctly saw that man sitting and I felt he was going to cause trouble.
I told my wife I was going to intercede and solve this problem.
She informed me no one was in that chair!
She believes my issue with the unresolved actions of this man, weeks before manifested the hallucination on this day.
My Wife wonders if LBD patients bring past memories into the present mind function and live them out.
And, I hope you remember me writing about being in our home, but in my mind, I was on a AEGIS Class Cruiser, yelling at a group of young Gunner's Mates for gun decking PMS and not doing Pre-Fires by the PMS Card.
I could see, smell, feel the ship.
I was actually walking through ship spaces!!!
In my mind, I was on that ship at that time and those people were real and I was talking out loud!
Not in my mind.
A telephone call brought me out of that hallucination.
Do we short cycle our memories and bring them forward?
If our memory can be represented by a sine-wave, is that sine-wave shorter and more compressed in LBD patients?
Is this why past memories and reality get mixed together in the LBD patient?
And, why do Alzheimer's patients stay in their mental comfort zone when LBD patients move in and out.
All these questions need research.
Does the Alzheimer's mind have a clear break in memories - a chasm the mind can't go forward or skip over - so the patient is stuck in the past and can't live in the current or move into the future?
Does the Lewy Body mind bunch up memories and mixes the past with the current and can't sort out the difference.
Do Lewy Body patients stay in current reality longer because the Alzheimer's "chasm" isn't a part of Lewy body dementia?
Does the Lewy Body brain lose the rhythm of normal brain waves, distorting the memories kept in those waves?
Does it run too fast & bump or blend memories together - like a heart that has an irregular heart beat?
Does the Lewy Body brain have a shorter span of brain waves or a faster flow - what causes the out of sequence memories that appear to be hallucinations?
Conversely does the Lewy Body brain bring unusual, or unresolved events from the past back into the present  to try to resolve or make sense of something the brain is dwelling on?
Hallucinations are a major part of LBD.
They can be frightening, as in my Christmas Tree Hallucinations.
Or, they can cause you to change the way you live your life, like my hallucinations of the man crossing the freeway caused me to stop driving.
But, the fact is, hallucinations are part of LBD and the are a big part of my life.
They can be harbingers of declines in cognitive ability or reflections of my past.
I truly do not understand them and only write this at the bequest of my Wife, who is deeply involved in my care.
I am blessed to have her and her interest in LBD.

<doc date=Saturday, September 26, 2015>
I wrote about my cognitive decline and my failed attempt at being a name tag maker.
But, because of the stress of preparation and travel, I have decided to give up our Ministry at Bay Breeze Assisted Living Facility.
We have been active in that Ministry for over three years.
It has been a blessing to us and I believe to the residents of Bay Breeze.
I was Blessed to Baptize two Men from Bay Breeze!
And we have studied  in-depth, at much of the Bible.
We have brought the Communion Table to these folks, a first for they community.
And the fellowship of those folks has strengthened me.
This Ministry started when we lived 5 minutes from Bay Breeze.
Now, it is a 40 minute drive, one way.
Then there is the time to prepare an in-depth, meat and potatoes, Bible study.
Many of the members of this Bible study group are well versed in the Bible!!
That means I must be on my toes!!
They have taught me more than I have taught them!
I love these folks and the staff.
But, it is more than I can to now.
And I really do not like to leave Azalea Trace.
I am, more and more, becoming a hermit in this 120 acre community.
Yes, I like to walk outside around the buildings.
Yes, I like to use the golf driving range.
Yes, I wash the car in the car wash stall.
But all that is rift here, where I can still see my building.
It is familiar, comfortable, and now, my home.
I do not like to venture outside of what is familiar.
Then there is riding in the car.
Since things seem closer than they might be, I get a bit nervous and twitchy as a passenger.
In truth, I drive my Wife crazy!!
STOP!
Watch out!!
You're too close!!
STOP!!
You get the idea.
So, we will reluctantly say good-by to our friends at Bay Breeze.
I am disappointed, but, it is a necessary concession to Lewy Body Dementia.
It is also another illustration that I am progressing more into the third quarter if this game with LBD.
Oh, and by the way, I am loosing to LBD.
But, I knew I would.
While I thought I was winning in the first and part of the second quarter, I started loosing in the second half of the second quarter.
And now, we are well into the third quarter and LBD is running up the score!!
At least, that is the football analogy.
The inability to learn new skills that I wrote about before and my realization that the Bay Breeze ministry was wearing me out and over whelming me has knock me down emotionally.
I am not sure what is coming next.
I know it will difficult, uncomfortable, and challenging.
I know I am no longer up to the challenge, so LBD will win.

<doc date=Thursday, September 24, 2015>
In the life of a LBD patient, ROUTINE is THE most important thing the caregiver can influence!!!
I cannot say that often enough.
And, even with my routine being content, I have issues.
More and more, I stay in my retirement community.
We do thing the same way everyday.
And when things change, for any reason, I am off my game.
My wife is very careful to control my routine.
She understands how my routine impacts me.
But, even with a stable routine, I have had to reduce some of the things I have done, routinely, over the past few years.
My cognitive ability and my stress load have required me to reduce the things that I do outside of Azalea Trace.
I simply cannot do as much as I once could.
But, back to routine.
I often hear about caregivers taking their Dementia patient to new locations, long vacations, visits to the Grand Kids, or even moving them after they have had their Dementia diagnosis for a while.
I am not a doctor, but I am a person with Lewy Body Dementia and I believe a major move now, would cause MAJOR cognitive and even physical issues.
On another note, but related to a stable routine;  I have had stability issues recently.
I now used my cane all the time.
The pain in my legs, all the way up to my buttock, is constant and increasing.
I do not complain openly about it because there is nothing I can do about it.
But, my Wife knows and called my Neurologist today to try to set up Physical Therapy in an attempt to mitigate the pain and maybe increase my stability.
I said I will go to the therapy as long as it is here, at Azalea Trace.
That way I will not go out of my familiar and protected community and my routine will be maintained.
So, it is my recommendation to maintain your Dementia patients routine completely.
If you plan on moving, do it early in the disease.
If you are in the second half of the journey, as I am, stay where you are!
Bring in help if you need to.
But don't change anything.
If you do, you may not like the results.

It is 8:10 AM here in Pensacola.
It is cool, sunny, the birds are singing, and I feel good.
I had a good night's sleep with few bathroom visits and although I have my normal leg pain, I feel OK.  Why?
What is the difference?
It is morning, daylight, and there are NO loud noises.
It still amazes me how there can be such a difference between how I feel in the morning and how I feel when the sun starts to go fade.
My wife can document these changes.
We keep the house brightly illuminated but that does not help.
The entire character of the world changes when it gets dark out.
Everything seems more sinister and threading.
Noises seem louder and more sharp!
Those noises cut through me like a sword.
I become grumpy, agitated, and I react with anger at anything and everything.
But now it is a bright morning and nothing seems to bother me.
How long this will last is any one's guess.
So, I will enjoy the good mood while it lasts.
More later.

<doc date=Tuesday, September 22, 2015>
OK, I realize I am depressed, angry, and difficult to get along with!
And yes, I know I have some friends, like Jerry and his family who are genuinely concerned about me and my journey.
And yes, my Wife cares, in her way.
I say that because she has to cope as a caregiver, a wife of a LBD patient, and a future widow!
But, I run into so many people that either call me a liar, deny there is a disease called Lewy Body Dementia, or just dismiss me as a crank.
So, my question is, does anyone care.
I don't see Jerry Lewis doing a Telethon for LBD patients.
And even the deaths of Robin Williams and Casey Casum did not help our cause.
The truth is, we are under publicized and under documented.
The Gay community had the same problems with AIDS and to fix that problem, they gave blood!
Then, many people that were not Gay got AIDS.
That gave AIDS plant of attention!!!
So, is there a way to infect people with Lewy Body Dementia?
No.
And since those of us with LBD are incarcerated in "Homes" or "Facilities" for our own protection, no one see's us and therefore, no one experiences LBD unless they have a relative or close friend that has it.
Friends, there is an interesting case.
Many of my friends have stopped contacting me since my diagnosis.
Hell, much of my family no longer contacts me!
Why, maybe they are afraid they will catch LBD from casual contact!
Or, maybe they just don't want to be around someone with Dementia.
Give me a break, I drool on my shirt and pee in my pants sometimes.
But, I can still be fun to be with!!
The fact is, I cannot do what I once did.
But I still shoot pretty well!
I will admit my stamina is not what it once was, but two hours at the range is enough for most folks.
Look, my point is, people with known diseases like cancer, get much more attention than Dementia patients,  I really do not know why, but I do know we get lonely.
Since most of us can't drive, getting out is dependent on those of you who are "Normal".
I am just complaining, I guess.
The sun is going down and I am dealing with my nightly friend; "Sun Downing".
So, just forget this post.
Oh, you already did.

<doc date=Saturday, September 19, 2015>
I am well into the third quarter of my journey with LBD.
Many changes have occurred since I wrote the first article about my condition.
So, I thought it was time for an update.
Depression is now my constant companion.
The vast majority of the time, I feel that no one cares about how I am or my needs.
I shun contact with most people with the exception of a few very close friends and small children!
I find i enjoy and crave spontaneous interaction with young children.
Why?
Maybe because they do not know me and do not know I have LBD.
They have now knowledge of how I was before the disease nor how the disease has impacted me.
These interactions are short, fun, and without any future connection.
I love to make small children laugh, feel important, and wanted.
Funny, as I write this, all of these emotions are missing in my life since LBD has progressed.
Sleep is my escape.
My bedroom is my sanctuary where I can thing, deal with my anger and other emotions on my terms, and be away from others and the world.
I seldom watch the news but prefer to get my news from the Internet, in small doses that I can control.
This isolates me from the diatribe of patrician people.
My Nation is in a fatal decline, just like me, and the news of the day painfully illustrates both truths to me.
Most people I love have withdrawn from me.
Oh, some are here, close to me, physically but not emotionally.
That is their way of dealing with my disease.
I now understand why the elderly, especially those with Dementia's are placed in care facilities and forgotten.
To invest time or emotions in these folks, like me, is too painful for the loved ones.
It is like keeping their loved ones dead body in the bedroom!
Well, I am not dead yet and I am still mostly here mentally, and I need mental stimulation and emotional and physical love!
I do not drive because of my disease.
We made that decision to protect us financially.
I love to drive, and being a passenger is painful to me.
But, it is the right decision and everything I get in the passengers seat, it cements that decision so that when I am no longer able to make that emotional decision, I will already be used to NOT driving.
It is sort of a reconditioning of my brain.
The same that happened at 16 when I received my driver's permit.
Not driving, does make me a prisoner.
While the community I live in offers many social events and opportunities to interact with others, I cannot go any where outside of the community without someone driving me.
There might as well be a all around this compound with guards and gun emplacements!
Many times, I am overwhelmed by noise, as I have written recently.
That night, I was violent angry and ready to fight someone, anyone, over the attack on my senses!!
I am also overwhelmed with a sense of not caring about myself or anything or anyone else.
When this overwhelms me, I feel "no one gives a shit"!
I want to be alone when this occurs.
Alone in all senses of the word.
Yet, I wish someone would hold me, kiss me, tell me I am loved, important, and needed.
Physically, I now NEED my cane for balance and I feel lost without it.
I have involuntary arm and leg movements.
My major muscles ache most of the time.
My digestive system is in turmoil.
I suffer from constipation/diarrhea bouts every couple of days.
There are no normal bathroom days.
Incontinence is not a constant condition but is starting to occur.
My vision is now impacted and I have difficulties seeing any distance.
I have great difficulty reading and comprehending.
My speech patterns have been altered to short, sentences and long searches for words to describe most things.
My Blood Pressure fluctuates causing me to become dizzy and unstable on my feet.
This autonomic disruption also impacts my sexual ability.
I cannot maintain an erection hard enough to achieve insertion or long enough to achieve orgasm.
This, along with loosing my independence leaves me feeling less than a man.
Mentally, I am loosing my memory of my favorite past, my Navy days.
I have periods of name remembrance and then loose those names and events.
My writing in my Navy Blog has all but stopped.
I get angry and abusive over events that I should not.
I have no social filters.
Much to my Wife's dismay.
I have been abandoned by my Congressman, Jeff Miller, of Florida and the Veterans Administration.
Congressman Miller and his staff have done nothing to help me with my VA claim.
The Disabled American Veterans Association has been a great help.
But, they can only do so much.
Congressman Miller has clout, but I guess I am not important to him!
This has, more and more, become a lonely, solitary, fight.
The doctors do not have a clue and I feel they learn more from me than I do from them.
Even the closest family and friends keep me at arms length not wanting to invest in a dieing person.
People I meet tell me I do not look sick, even retired doctors.
Even though they have no base line or insight into my mental or physical condition.
If someone has cancer and they tell a new acquaintance, that new person does not say; "You don't look like you have cancer!".
Yet they do say, you don't have Dementia!
The end of their statement is never said but only thought; "You lying sack of shit!"
But, I hear it and it hurts and frustrates me.
Someone is going to get hurt someday soon when I canon longer control the emotion to punch that uncaring individual in the nose!
As you can see, I am now full consumed with Lewy Body Dementia.
In the beginning, I had the perspective of: "That is interesting" when a symptom occurred.
Now, I only feel rejection and hopelessness.
Much of the writing concerning Dementia is centered on the caregivers.
Well, from my experience, they have it easy.
Just detach from the patient and go on about your life.
No one really want to know what the Dementia Patient is gong through and experiencing.
Every time I tell someone what I am experiencing, they tell me they have even more horrific issues.
So, I seldom tell anyone anything.
Like I said, this is a lonely journey with a terrible disease, that none knows about or cares about.
I would be much better off in a Dementia ward of a skilled care facility, with others on a similar journey.
Just lock the doors and keep the gawkers out.
This was a long, very personal, post for the sole purpose of baring all about my journey with LBD.
It was not meant to hurt or get back at anyone.
It was meant to educate anyone who really cared about someone with Lewy Body Dementia.
If that person really exists.
My posts will not become further apart and shorter as I find it difficult to write in this or my Navy blog.
I am still here, just moving much slower.

<doc date=Friday, September 18, 2015>
As you know, we live in a Continuing Care Retirement community (CCRC) called Azalea Trace in Pensacola.
It is a very nice, quiet, genteel, community.
We share one border with the University of West Florida.
We are good neighbors with them, but last night, I learned they are NOT good neighbors with us.
I was walking the dogs at about 2030, (8:30 PM) and I heard this extremely loud, amplified noise coming from a brightly illuminated portion of the campus.
The noise, coupled with the darkness,  drove me into an almost uncontrollable rage!
The noise from the speakers never quit!!
Who ever the moron was on the microphone, he or she was screaming and the system was not well adjusted, so all they got was a loud reverberation and muffled voices!!
It kept going, and going, and I got more and more angry!!
I finally brought the dogs in before they were ready and after loudly expressing my anger, I went to bed to hide!!
I wanted to scream at the noise!!!
Loud noises cause me problems.
But this was way past loud!
It drove me into a rage that only bed could begin to control.
I have no respect for UWF based on the students I see in the area.
Couple that with their reckless, disrespectful, aggressive, asinine, noise attack and I question their designation as a University!
The people in charge should know how this would effect their neighbor.
Or not, see as I believe the staff and professors are probably as dumb as their students.
I probably have no recourse.
And that aggravates me almost as much as the noise did.
Again, there is nothing I can do except hide in bed.
LBD is now in full swing and it is now controlling every facet of my life.
I guess I am fully into the third quarter of this game, and I am loosing badly.

<doc date=Friday, September 4, 2015>
Many times, couples and individuals postpone decisions that would be much better made when everyone was healthy and fully cognitive.
Now, I am not saying we should make these decisions when we are 25.
But, postponing them until the Dementia patient needs skilled care is not a plan either!
But, we are human and many of us just ignore the inevitable and hope things will work out.
Trust me, they won't!
Again, everyone does not have $250,000 to give to a Continuing Care Retirement Community for the entrance fee!
But, there are many great communities that offer Continuing Care without the Entrance fee!
The key to understanding the future is research.
Get on the Internet, go visit communities, listen to their options, and then, seek advice from family, friends who have been on the journey ahead of you, and professionals like Senior Attorneys, Doctors, and Family Counselors.
But do something!!
Before you are in the predicament of having to place your Dementia Patient in a facility you don't like!!
Another issue to consider is the fact that the Facility determines the level of care your Dementia Patient needs!!
You may think Assisted Living will work fine, but your patient may need Memory Support to Skilled Care.
Then there is the issue of anger outbursts and even violence.
These issues reduce the facilities that will accept your Dementia Patient.
There is one more issue I want to bring out.
I know how disrupting my daily routine and living arrangements effects my journey with Dementia.
Our move to Azalea Trace was difficult for me.
It confused me, caused me hallucinations, and a feeling of being lost and confused.
Now, my wife worked with me endlessly, showing me where everything was placed.
How the dishes were in the cabinets, where the coffee maker and coffee were.
How, everything worked.
She went over and over these things to make me comfortable.
And Azalea Trace did everything to make our move easy and orderly.
They even have a Sponsor assigned to help you get acclimated to the community.
Azalea Trace did an outstanding job!
But even with all of that, I was negatively impacted by the move.
I remember an emotion I had of all of my stuff being stolen when we moved!!
I kept asking, where is my stuff?!
If your Dementia Patient is confused, cannot function in the home he or she gads lived in for 10, 20, 30, years, how do you think they will do when you completely uproot them and move them to a facility they have never seen!
Trust me, it will accelerate their dementia symptoms and probably have a lasting, negative effect on their cognitive abilities.
Change is not the friend of a Dementia Patient!!
We did our homework, moved early, and chose a community equipped to meet both of our needs.
Did we have disagreements and major issues doing this?
You Bet!!!
But the end product was good for me and my wife.
So, just like the old railroad crossing signs said;  "Stop, Look, Listen"!
And then decide early in the journey with any type of Dementia in determining living arrangements for your Dementia Patient!

Two things happened yesterday that I would like to report.
First, I had a planned appointment with my GP.
She is a very caring individual that makes me feel like I am her only patient and that she is genuinely concerned about my health.
When we left that appointment my wife commented;  "You always smile and seem uplifted when we leave Dr. Laenger's.
My reply was; Because she cares about me and listens to me and my concerns.
Second, amy wife was making telephone calls to the ladies she will be the Discussion Leader for in this year's Bible Study Fellowship group in Pensacola.
One of those ladies  called has a husband that has Lewy Body Dementia.
They began to compare notes on their husbands.
It seems that ladies husband suffers the same internal turmoil and frustration that I do.
She also said, according to my wife, that he gets frustrated when people don't believe he is ill.
Imagine that.
Now, maybe, she will understand my frustration and anger.
Until NOW my wife has never had contact with a LBD patient with the exception of me.
So, she had no understanding of the issues I endure.
But, if another person, out of her circle, has the same or similar issues, then she has someone to compare notes with.
LBD sufferers and caregivers live in a personally imposed vaccum.
Since there are few support groups, my wife, and I suspect other caregivers, have no one to compare notes with and therefore they have little understanding of what their loved one is dealing with.
Sometimes, loved ones don't want to believe the complaints of their patients.
Why?
Because they don't want us sick!
But, if they know and interact with others caring for a LBD patient, the understanding will increase and maybe, we sufferers will be believed.
I can only hope.

You all probably know, finding information about LBD is difficult at best and maddening most of the time.
Most doctors are completely ignorant about this disease.
Add to that the fact that we are all a big experiment to the medical community and I find myself angry and ready to punch someone.
My wife wants me to look into physical therapy that would help my leg stiffness and pain.
Online, that info is not available.
I will ask my GP and Neurologist, but I expect to get the same answer.
I find myself getting more and more frustrated with this journey.

<doc date=Monday, August 17, 2015>
Today, we had the poodles groomed.
We use a groomer that is in the city we lived in before Azalea Trace.
The groomer is excellent and we have not found anyone her that does as well, regardless of price.
The groomer is at L-9 Splash and Dash in Gulf Breeze, Florida, if you live in the area.
They are great.
Since it takes 45-60 minutes to get there, we stay in Gulf Breeze for the two hours it takes to get both dogs groomed.
So, we shop at the local stores.
Today, we walked around the local Walmart and Lowes.
After 90 minutes of casual walking, stopping, and standing, I was exhausted.
My legs burned, and I was having some difficulty propelling myself.
I was surprised since this is the first time I remember being this fatigued simply shopping.
When we returned home, I ate lunch and then took a 4 hour nap!
And I am still tired!
These are all issued caused by the disease and I understand that.
But, it also illuminates the progression of the disease.
I often wondered why seemingly fit individuals used the power baskets at the stores or used power scooters.
Now I understand.
And no, I am not going to use a power chair!!
At least not yet.

I had my BP taken today, as planned.
It was 110/60.
A week or so ago it was 138/98.
As I thought, the evidence is point towards those pesky Lewy Bodies messing with the autonomic functions of my body.
As I wrote yesterday, I have issues maintaining my body temperature.
Last night we went to a local Class "AA" Baseball Game.
It was a great time, and it was warm and I perspired profusely all night.
I was wiping sweat off my brow and head all evening.
My hair, what little I have, was soaking wet all night.
I believe this is another issue related to the disruption of my autonomic functions.
It is interesting that the secondary issues of LBD are kicking in so violently now.
I used to work with another Gunners Mate wen I was the GMG Detailer.
He used to say; "I don't know what's happening, but it is happening fast!"
I believe that clearly applies to me now.
More later.

I have written before how realistic my dreams are.
I have also written about how my realistic dreams melt into my waking hours.
Recently my dreams have been about loosing my car!
Not loosing my driving privileges, but loosing my car and cannot find it!
It is unnerving for me to wake up wondering where my car is!
In my dream, I am walking around the city, looking for my car.
Checking parking lots, parking garages, lots behind buildings and always in the dark!
It is very upsetting.
Fear is becoming more and more a theme in my dreams and in my life.
If you knew me before, you would know I was not afraid of many things.
Yes, poisonous snakes freaked me out then and now.
And I am not too comfortable with spiders and ticks.
But, dangerous ordnance, heavy seas, high pressure hydraulics, electricity, fast moving equipment, people, drunks, and most dangerous situations including guns and combat, did not frighten me in the least.
Now, being out in the dark, riding in a car, unfamiliar surroundings, strangers, and many other things that once were not a threat are now a major source of fear!!
Then, add my frightening dreams and you can see my issue.
Then add a new emotion of my future and I am not doing too well.
You see, I realize things are progressing and my health is deteriorating.
BP issues, irregular heartbeat, inability to control my body temperature, and muscle issues that cause mobility problems.
After five years with LBD, we are on a definite downhill slide.
I have a lot on my plate and my dreams and emotions seem to become even more of an issue.
But, I guess it is just where I am at this time.
More later.

I have been looking back over my life in the last few days.
As a matter of fact, I have been quite retrospective over the last week.
Since my brain focuses on the past so well, it is easy to see the things I never got to do and the things I failed at miserably.
Yes, I do have my successes.
But lately, those things I did not do or could not do seem to fill my mind.
But a few days ago, I was at a "Sportsman's Night Out" at a large Church in Pensacola.
There had to be 3000 people there!
There were door prizes of epic proportion, good food, and past two time Bass Masters Champ Hank Parker as the guest speaker.
He told some of his favorite hunting and fishing stories, and then he offered HIS testimony.
Hank came to Christ in much the same way we all do, or at least how I did.
He denied Christ until the Holy Spirit opened his heart.
But Hank quoted a Scripture that pierced my heart.
It is in the Book of Romans Paul wrote, and I paraphrase;  What good is having all the toys of life, all the money you could ever spend, and all the fun in life there could be, if it meant you would go to Hell, forever!!?
Hank went on to tell us, who will remember what you did 50 years from now?
A hundred years from now?
A thousand years from now?!!
Trust me, a month after you are buried, most of the folks that knew you will not be able to remember where you were buried or when you died.
So, all we do should be for God.
Yes, I know you have to work.
But, you can do your job in a way that gives credit to God.
You can raise your children in the Church!
You can "Love one another" as Jesus Commanded us to do.
Those things will live forever!!
Trust me, the bumper sticker: 'Whoever dies with the most toys, WINS!"
is a lie!!!
I have actually learned that the things you have cause you problems.
Why, because you have to secure them, maintain them, insure them, and worry about them!!
Think about that!!
So, the next time I get retrospective, I am going to concentrate on what I have done for the Lord.
Note; This does not remotely look like what I was going to write!
But, it IS what God wanted me to write!
Funny how that happens.

I have written before about situations that case me to become extremely agitated.
One of them, and maybe the most intense anger and agitation causing item is someone constantly complaining about something I cannot do anything about!!
For instance, a few days ago we were taking our walk around the complex here in the retirement community we live in.
It is a scant mile around the roadway that circles our community.
The speed limit is 15 MPH.
That is a safe speed for a roadway that has hairpin turns and switchbacks.
Not to mention senior citizens walking on the side of the road.
Many of the folks that drive this road do more than 15 MPH.
Some are reckless and dangerous.
My wife spent the entire 45 minutes of walking, 3 laps around the compound, complaining about the speed of the cars  like I could do something about it!
Then, I lost my temper and walked in the middle of the street with my cane raised towards a car that was obviously speeding.
When the driver stopped, I verbally berated him for speeding!!
I probably scared the moron to death.
Not my problem, he was speeding and I was out of control with anger!!
Look folks, I cannot change anything in the world today.
There is no one in the world that does what I tell them too!
Not my wife, my son, my grandsons, or even the two poodles!!
So why wire brush me for the speed people drive, how they park, or anything else in this community!!!
Just leave me alone, I cannot fix anything!!
If you have a complaint, bug the Executive Director just half as much as I get heckled and something might get done.
I worry I may loose total control of my temper.
That would not be good for me, or anyone else.
So, please help me.
Please.
PS;  The next time I write about this, I will do my writing when my anger is out of control!!
Then you will see just how angry I am.
Expletives will NOT be deleted!

Why do people hide the fact that they have Dementia?
Yes, in the early stages, only the patient may know of the diagnosis.
But, soon, the issues start to identify themselves.
Forgetfulness, not knowing where you are or where to turn when driving a familiar route, forgetting the names of people or pets that have been with you for years, agitation with yourself, and depression.
Maybe because I am well into my journey with LBD, but I can pick out someone with Dementia pretty quickly.
I see the telltale signs easily and quickly.
And, as I look back at my early stages before diagnosis, I can clearly see signs on my Dementia in things I did that were out of character and odd.
Like making a hat out of the agenda page at a Church Business Meeting and putting that hat on my head!
In any case, identifying yourself as a Dementia patient may case some employment issues but being honest allows your employer to make adjustments to your work environment, under the Americans With Disability Act, to keep you employed longer.
I know the GS 14 and GS 15 I worked for did everything to help me work as long as was practical.
I understand there may be some embarrassment or feelings of inadequacy, but, any Dementia is a disease, not a choice.
I believe dealing with LBD up front and in the open has helped me and my Wife.
Yes, it has caused some friends to withdraw.
Trust me, it is not contagious!
But, I also understand I can be hard to be around sometimes.
But I still believe honesty is the best option.
I bring this up because I play billiards with a gentleman that has some form of Dementia.
It is apparent!
Yet, he does not openly discuss his condition, so I cannot offer him the benefit of my journey.
I plan on asking him, in print, in the near future.
I believe we can both benefit from open communication.
In any case, if you see someone displaying Dementia symptoms, I recommend you treat them with respect and wait until they open up.

We saw our GP yesterday and she agreed that it was Orthostatic Hypotension.
She cut my dosage of Cardura in half.
I have taken that for Prostate issues for a very long time.
That will cause my BP to go up, and that may be an issue when my BP goes up.
This may be an ongoing issue.
She also wants me to cut my salt intake and cut down on deserts!
Oh, and she wants me to drink more water and less coffee.
Since the only water I drink is when I take pills, that will be a challenge.
I do not like the taste of water.
Beer, Coffee, ice tea, are all OK, but water is just bland.
But, I will try.
Another issue, my short term memory is getting even worse, if that was possible.
I went to pick up dinner at the Take Out of our community today, I forgot my wife gave me a list of what she wanted!
Then, when I brought the meals back, I put my salad dressing on her salad.
Everything seemed to blend together for me.
I also forgot my morning pills today!
I truly am having difficulties in conducting daily activities.
More progression.
More later;

I have written before about the autonomic functions being disrupted by Lewy Body Dementia.
I am experiencing BP fluctuations that are beginning to impact my way of life.
Last week, I had a low BP reading in the 90/60 variety.
Today, at Church, I was sweating so profusely I had to continually wiper my forehead of sweat for about 30 minutes.
During this time, I was dizzy and weak.
For a few minutes, I was actually contemplating calling 911.
But, being the hard head I am, I did not.
When we came home, we stopped in the Assisted Living portion of our community and had my BP taken.
The CNA that took it was concerned and did not tell me the reading.
Then she took it again in the other arm and told me it was 148/98.
That is a wild fluctuation in less than 7 days.
It is now 1300 and I am still weak and somewhat dizzy.
I have had high BP in the past, but not for a few years.
I know what I feel and experience when I have high BP, and today's events are not close to what I experienced in Church today.
So, we will call my GP tomorrow and go see her and see what she thinks.
It is my opinion, based on my research, that this is caused by my autonomic functions being disrupted by the Lewy Bodies.
We will see what we will see.
More later.

I have decided to address a problem that many men with LBD experience, including me.
If you are squeamish about sexual issues, QUIT READING NOW!!
I have written about autonomic functions and how LBD impacts them.
It is known that our blood pressure is controlled by our autonomic brain functions.
I wrote a few days ago about the low blood pressure I have recently experienced.
It appears to be OH.
I may have been having this issues for a while and did not know it.
But, low blood pressure, loss of muscle strength, and low stamina also negatively impact a man's ability to perform sexually.
In my case, and in cases I have referenced on the Internet, we have difficulty maintaining an erection and difficulty in achieving orgasm.
Sometime, orgasm is impossible, even if an erection is maintained.
Believe me, this is painful!
Some of you might say;  Why would you worry about sex?
You're too old for that!
No I am not.
And my wife is certainly not too old for sexual satisfaction.
But, I am unable to meet her needs.
This now becomes an emotional issue as well as a physical issue.
Some may say, take one of their miracle pills for men!
That may not be a good idea for someone with the medical issues and drugs most LBD patients deal with.
So, how do we deal with this issue.
First, talk to your medical team.
Your GP, Neurologist, Psychologist.
Second, realize you are not the only one having this difficulty.
You are not alone!
Third, there are other alternatives that will help you meet your partners sexual needs.
They may require you opening your mind a little, but how important is your Wife's sexual satisfaction to you?
Not every LBD male patient has this issue.
Some have the exact opposite problem!
They maintain an erection all the time and want sex frequently because they forget they just had sex!
This could also cause issues!!
My point is, LBD is a journey.
There will be a few issues that will cause you to try new and uncharted methods to live with the issue.
You and your wife can choose to be miserable or choose to try to solve the problem.
So, open your mind, talk to your doctors, and live!
Your life is shorter than it was yesterday.

OK, I could not have spelled Orthostatic Hypotension before today.
And I completely forgot the LBD issues that impact the Autonomic functions of the body.
But, a visit to a doctor's office sent an alarm to the doctor and us.
I had moderately high blood pressure a few years ago.
Recently, I have had a normal blood pressure reading that has been descending.
We thought, good!
Eating healthy is helping me.
But, yesterday's BP reading was 93/60.
The CNA started asking me questions!
Tonight, I talked to my son's Brother in Law, who is an MD.
He saturated asking me questions.
Yes, I am a little light headed, experience some dizziness getting up or laying down.
He than said;  Not good.
It looks like my autonomic dysfunctions have started to effect my BP.
So, I started doing some research and discovered a paper on the topic of Orthostatic Hypotension on the LBDA web site, dated October 2012.
That article did not paint a good image.
It seems OH is a major cause of death for LBD patients.
Now, I take Cardura for a swollen Prostate.
Cardura IS a high blood pressure medicine that was later found to reduce the effects of an enlarged prostate.
This will be part of my discussion on Monday with my GP.
For the moment, we will watch and wait.
But, Monday, my GP and I are going to have a serious discussion.
The treatment of LBD is a relatively new process.
In the beginning of my journey, I pressed to get an accurate diagnosis so I could take advantage of whatever research was being done.
I never thought I would get to this position, since I believe all of my treatment is an experiment in itself.
My Neurologist in Virginia was on the cutting edge of LBD research and she is the reason, and of course, God's provisions, I have had as long a period of slow progression of my LBD as I have.
But, as I have said before, the speed has increased and new symptoms and issues seem to be popping up weekly!
But this one, seems to be major!
OH coupled with my irregular heartbeat may be an even bigger challenge.
We will see.
As always, I will report all symptoms, effects, treatments and emotions related to this new major byproduct to LBD.
This is just another challenge we need to find a way to deal with.
I will keep you informed.

You can see from last night's post that I was NOT having a good night.
And you must realize I have met some very nice, courteous, intelligent, people, in the Pensacola area.
I am blessed to live in Azalea Trace and I have made some new friends here.
So, it is not as bleak as I felt it was last night.
Just the same, almost every night, I am overcome by this "Sun Downing" gloom that almost debilitates me.
I have not been able to find a way to positively deal with this problem.
Yes, I pray about these issues.
God has been very gracious to me in my journey with LBD.
I guess I need to be even more dependent on His Grace as this progresses.
However, it is difficult when you are overwhelmed with negative feelings and depression.
Also, I would bet I am not the only Dementia patient with these issues and struggles.
That does not justify my issues but it does explain them.
So, the struggle continues.

<doc date=Saturday, July 11, 2015>
Anywhere you live, their will be frustrations.
No place will be 100% to any person's likings.
Living where we do, is a wonderful situation, for the most part.
I am getting involved with volunteer activities in our community and in turn getting to know many of the residents.
I play billiards two night a week, fill in for the Staff Chaplin when he needs a replacement, and I am having fun.
There are a couple of issues I wish I could solve.
But I can't!
I hear about these issues almost daily!
Why, I don't know.
But I do.
This frustration makes me feel unsatisfied and frustrated.
They also make me question my decision to live here.
I sometimes think I would have been better waiting for a spot at he Armed Forces Retirement Home in Gulfport, Mississippi.
And, I am still on that waiting list.
This frustration and constant bereavement over issues I cannot control make my life even more difficult.
And believe me, anger is not my friend!!
I try very, very hard NOT to loose my temper.
It would not lead to a good outcome.
I have told you before I really do not enjoy living in East Lower Alabama.
The people her are ignorant, rude, and very self centered, for the most part.
I truly can tell you I have not met a nice, open, friendly, native of this lost world of morons since we moved her, almost four years ago!
It might be me and the effects of LBD, but I don't think so.
So, being mental beaten for things I cannot change and living in a town with unfriendly, stupid, people, tales it's toll on my mental health.
Maybe I need more pills.
Or, Maybe, I should go back to drinking beer.
Lots of beer.

<doc date=Friday, July 10, 2015>
I see the commercial for the various companies that provide people to sit with those of us with elderly issues.
I guess this is a good service, but where are the person's family?
The more my dementia progresses, the less I see family!
When I  could fix things, do things, be productive for people, I had list of company.
Now, none!
Dementia is a disease the patient faces alone!
No one really knows or can understand how you are being impacted.
No one really wants to understand what I am going through or be with me when I am dealing with this disease.
Since I am of no use to them, I am not worth being with.
Yes, I receive telephone calls and emails.
I appreciate those contacts and they help me immensely!
But an in person visit would be much more helpful.
I do understand people have their own lives.
They have to work, pay attention to their own families, do home chores, shop, and relax themselves.
So, I am at least number six on the list.
So, maybe I am just being sensitive.
Another issue is when I describe an issue to someone, and I get:  I have the same issue!
An mine is really bad.
Go get your own diagnosis!
Here I am, trying to educate you to my plight, and you want to compete with me!!
That is one of the two insults that impact me.
The other is: "You don't look sick!
I don't see any symptoms!
Are you sure?"
That one is going to land me in jail someday!
So, I guess paying someone to be your parent's friend, driver, cook, game partner, at least soothes your guilty conscience.
My view is, don't come to my funeral and grieve if you could not spend quality time with me when I could enjoy your company.
As a matter of fact, I am thinking of NOT having a funeral.
Since my wife will not let me be buried at sea, I can at least control the attendance at an event about me.
Do I sound bitter?
Good, I am.

<doc date=Tuesday, July 7, 2015>
Last night, I was grumpy, agitated, and there was another emotion that I was experiencing that was new to me.
Let me proceed and try to explain.
I had the realization, which for me is more than a feeling, that I was loosing my grasp on reality.
Yes, all of the normal evening issues were there, but they were amplified.
Noise bothered me more, I was angry at the world, I felt week, diminished, and mentally foggy.
But I also felt unable to live in the world as a whole.
As I tried to go to sleep, I fought mental battles with people that I see as hindrances to my happiness.
I anguished over comments made by my wife, about numerous things I can do nothing about.
And I longed to be in that memory support facility in Daphne, Alabama, that I once told you about.
The smallest thing upset me and I had to fight an internal battle to keep control of my anger.
I only had one minor outburst over the ongoing parking issues that my wife seems to want to continually bring up.
The remainder of the time, I just kept my emotions inside and stewed.
It is my opinion that my journey with LBD took a giant turn last night and accelerated down hill.
I slept fitfully last night and when I did sleep, I had violent dreams.
It is now 5AM and I have had a shower, shaved, and I am ready to face the day.
That seems like a very brave statement to me.
We will see.

<doc date=Sunday, July 5, 2015>
Every Sunday and Wednesday night, I play billiards right here in a First Class billiards room right here at Azalea Trace.
I wish my Dad could see this facility.
He would live in the Pool room!
He was a great pool player and I never caught on to the game.
Now, I am learning, from some elderly masters of the game.
They are more than happy to teach me and I appreciate their help.
My Dementia does impact my ability to play ad learn this game.
For instance, we play "8 Ball".
You either have the "Stripes or the Solids".
From one shot to the next, I do not remember what balls I am shooting at.
When we play partners, it becomes even more difficult.
Then, there is all the advice I get from the "Pros".
I forget how to apply they "English" on the ball from shot to shot since my short term memory is SHOT!
But, many of the men playing with me have the same issues.
We help each other stay on the right type of ball or help them to find their best shot, regardless if they are our opponent or teammate.
It is almost like we are playing against the effects of aging instead of each other.
We also cheer when one of us makes a great shot.
While most of the men I shoot pool with are in the 80- 90 age group, we all seem to have the same deficiencies of age.
Mine just came sooner than theirs.
And, no one seems to get angry when we miss a shot or try to shoot the wrong ball.
It is a group of friends, having a good time, playing a game of pool.
No pressure, not tension, just relaxing fellowship.
I truly enjoy these outings and I only have to walk to the next building and ride the elevator up to the third floor!
Living here at Azalea Trace has given me a social outlet that I lost when I quit driving.
This is a great place for me to be.

<doc date=Wednesday, July 1, 2015>
We have been exceptionally busy the last two weeks.
Busy equates to stress for me.
If I have more than one thing to do in any day, I am overwhelmed.
That stress usually manifests itself as increased Dementia issues.
And that is exactly what has happened.
I have had a continuing dream that I own a Cabin Cruiser boat and it is having numerous issues that I then try to figure out in my waking hours.
Then, a day or so ago, I was in the bathroom brushing my teeth and my wife came in behind me and touched me.
I jumped out of my skin, turned around, and did not recognize my wife!
I truly do not know why I did not punch her.
I am glad I did not!
Other issues have surfaced including irritability and mistrust of everyone around me.
Again, I have been experiencing degradation of my mental and physical condition.
This is just another example of the direction my condition is going.
While all this concerns me, I still remain hopeful.
More later.

<doc date=Tuesday, June 23, 2015>
It amazes me what gives me the feeling of security and calm now.
Before, my idea of security was a stockpile of food, water, ammo, and guns.
A home sturdy enough to defend and a vehicle that would endure most weather conditions.
Today, I have a total different perspective.
This evening, we took our own tour of the Assisted Living and Skilled Nursing care facilities here a Azalea Trace.
Our tour was after dinner, totally unannounced, and without fanfare.
Boy was I impressed!
First, if you have ever been in a Skilled Nursing Facility, you know the smell of adult incontinence products is always present.
Well, not here at Azalea Trace!
There were no calls for attention, and no one abandoned in the hallway.
Instead, I saw content, well cared for individuals whose needs were being met.
Then we toured Assisted Living.
I asked one of the Nurses on duty to show us a vacant apartment.
She was more than happy to show us an empty couples apartment.
It had a large living room, a separate bedroom that would easily fit our King Size Bed, a bathroom that was roomy, safe, and fully equipped for my needs.
It had a well equipped kitchenette with microwave, refrigerator, and plenty of cabinets.
The Single apartment was one room with a private bath that was roomy, clean, and well appointed.
There was an outside area that made me feel secure since it was enclosed by other wings of the facility.
There were benches, swings, a picnic area, and plenty of green spaces.
Inside, there was a multi-function room with BIG screen television and another separate lounge with a television and gas log fireplace.
They provide three meals a day, snacks, drinks, and coffee, 24/7.
I was ready to make the move right then and there.
Of course, my wife is not and I agree with her.
But, it gave both of us a sense of security and comfort knowing that Azalea Trace had these beautiful facilities ready for us when we need them.
I honestly feel secure here.
That is very important for me, and I see a smooth transition when the time comes.
As a Baby Boomer, it is good to know ACTS has our needs and wants in mind.
Thanks!
I can no longer meet my own security needs.
But, the community we live in can and does!
So, I am secure and comfortable.
That equals contentment for me.

<doc date=Friday, June 19, 2015>
I know that I act and look better when I have company, or when we are at Church, or when we are shopping or on some outing.
I know that phenomena is refereed to as "Showtime".
I know I do it and so does m wife.
What I did not understand is that it is not a voluntary action!
I was reading a post on the Blog, "The Lewy Body Roller Coaster" and learned that "Showtime" is an involuntary reaction caused by the effects of LBD on the brain!
That makes sense to me, since I once said I was going to "STOP" looking normal just to fit in.
Now, in my defense, I forgot I made that comment, but now I realize I cannot stop looking good when I am in situation with people.
Does that make sense?
So, telling the caregiver of a LBD patient of the person afflicted with LBD themselves that the look and sound normal is really true.
because of the involuntary "Showtime" effect.
It is also one of the most insulting, insensitive, comments you can make, IF you know the person has LBD.
I also realize most folks do not know anything about LBD, or Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, the common cold, electricity, of food preparation.
As a matter of fact, the average American is as dumb as a tree stump!
So, they cannot be held accountable for insulting us.
Now that fact should really want you to stop taking your meds!
</doc>
<doc date=Tuesday, June 16, 2015>
I have written a few times about the comments folks make when I tell them I have LBD.
People make judgements based on how they THINK I should act or appear.
I never understood that, until now.
As I was going to sleep for my afternoon nap, it came to me how good I have had it!
Because of Dr. Mary Bowles' fast action in getting me on Namenda and Arecept, my experience with LBD has been gentle and slow, until now.
You know that I have reported the speed and course change of my LBD.
In the past, I probably did look "perfectly normal"!
As I have said many times before, I was not drooling on my shirt and peeing in my pants.
And since those characteristics are what people expect from a dementia patient, I can now see their point.
Another point is, because of the "Show Time" response for most LBD patients, I almost always tried to look as "normal" as I could.
That probably masked my disease from others.
I also realized I no longer feel comfortable with people outside of Azalea Trace!
I do not like being on the roads, interacting with people I do not know or do not share something in common with.
Nor do not like crowds.
I feel safer, within the confines of my retirement community.
I have commented on feeling so secure and comfortable in one of the "Memory Care" facilities we looked at drink our search for a community.
That facility still seems the most acceptable for me.
I would much rather be with other dementia patients, in a facility that offers every necessary service.
That being said, I am doing well here and would not move.
I now know fully, what LBD is like and so does my wife.
I am sure that others who interact with me on more than a cursory level, see this also.
If not, they are either not looking or don't care.
But, they should understand, neither do I.
So, that is the latest update.
Painful to some, but all truth and reality.
</doc>
<doc date=Monday, June 8, 2015>
I have told you before that I had near total recall before LBD.
Now, I cannot remember simple things that everyone, including me, took for granted.
For instance, something to search on the Internet will come into my mind, and before I can type it into the computer, it is gone.
There are other examples of this frustrating issue caused by LBD.
For instance, writing this post.
I had a number of examples in my mind to relate to you, but the telephone rang, I answered it, and now, I am at a loss as to what I wanted to write!
This may seem inconsequential to you, but it is maddening to me.
What I could do and how I lived is now gone!
I am a prisoner of a deep, dark, abyss, void of recent thoughts.
Instead, I think of the past and those who I knew.
I have little connection to the present.
Again, another issue caused by LBD.
More later.

I realize that my emotional control system is compromised.
I also realize my social filters are compromised.
I wish those around me understood these issues.
I also understand I need some way to blow off the built up emotions that I try so VERY hard to control!
But, I have no way, unfortunately.
When I was on active duty in the Navy, we used to go out and drink!
Beer, booze, or both!
We used those times at the "Club" built camaraderie and helped us get rid of the built up stress!
Since we all shared the same stress levels from the same problems, it was a "Support" group for stressed out sailors.
While I do not recommend this type of "Stress Relief" it did work for us.
Since I no longer participate in this sort of stress relief, I need to find a way to relieve this pressure before I blow up!
Screaming, punching walls, abusing the dogs or my wife are non starters.
And, since I cannot do ANYTHING about any thing that stresses me, I am all the more frustrated!!
For instance, my Wife continually brings up the parking issues her at Azalea Trace!
There is nothing in the world I can do to fix this issue.
Why in the Hell do I hear about it, everyday!!
I had a spirited discussion with the Executive Director, to no avail.
Any other discussion of this issues only serves to piss me off!!
I have written about this before, at length.
You need to realize this is THE ONLY avenue I have to vent.
And short of beating the ship out of someone right now, it will have to do.
This is a terrible disease and I am tired of fighting with it.

<doc date=Thursday, June 4, 2015>
I may have written about this before in this venue, or it may have been on my Navy blog.
Regardless, it bears repeating!
The MOST unused Federal Pension Program is the Veteran's Aid and Attendance Pension.
It is designed to help those who served honorably one day in the Military during a War or combat action like the Cold War.
It benefits the Veteran and the Spouse.
There are some asset restrictions, but they are reasonable and do not include your home or other possessions.
And, you can have money in the bank and still qualify!
How many of us have parents that need money for retirement, health care, or other living expenses?
This program may be the help they need.
I have a number of friends that have accessed this VA Pension and are now much better off.
I strongly recommend you check out this program on the Veteran's Administration Web Site.
If it does not help you, it may help someone you know!
Please spread the word.
It pains me to see our Veterans living without the care they need.
Especially if they are living in a Nursing Home or Assisted Living Facility!
Additionally, this program will pay for in home care, and other living issues.
Thanks for your help!

There are the obvious mental issues of Dementia.
Depression, Anxiety, Hallucinations, Isolation, and other lesser issues.
But, there is also the issue with the individuals will to live.
Yes, I think about life and how to live it often.
For instance, I know I do my best when I am doing God's work.
That is when my mind works the best and I feel my best.
Teaching Bible Studies, Preaching, visiting the sick, and just witnessing to others.
But, I also know that I have times when I am not on my game, and not in control of my cognitive abilities.
That is when I am at my lowest and when I question everything.
The truth is, I have thought often, recently, about stopping all of the Dementia drugs.
Especially after the negative issues with Namenda XR.
That was a very low time for me and one full of self doubt and questioning.
I believe all of us dealing with LBD ask ourselves the same questions.
We all want to live and be active and connected to life.
None of us want to be incapacitated and lost in a world that none else can enter.
So, the inner conflict continues and the effects of Dementia continue to confuse my cognitive abilities.
I believe that most people will not openly discuss this topic and I also know my family will not enter into this discussion with me.
I understand their position.
They love me and want me to be OK.
They cannot possibly see my position.
I also understand that truth.
But, it is something caregivers and LBD patients should discuss, openly.
So, I bring this up to al lot you, now.
I will bet, this will make many of you uncomfortable.
It makes me uncomfortable.
But, it is a fact of this disease.
When do we stop medicating ourselves and let the disease take it's course.
Especially when we as patients, know things for us are not as good as those on the outside think.
For instance, ask my son and wife how I am doing and they will say; very well.
My view is not near as good.
So, right off the bat, we are at an impasse.
And the Neurologist only know what I tell him!
So, his view is tainted to begin with.
My Psychologist knows better that any other Doctor where I am.
And he is very open with my wife as to where I am and what I am dealing with.
Where am I right now.
Some days I am good.
I am not as cognitively talented and gifted as I once was.
My short term memory and executive functions are severely limited.
I have problems separating my dream life from my reality.
I hallucinate still and my leg pain is increasing.
Additionally, I am having difficulty with stability when standing and walking.
I am still hard headed and do not use my cane often.
It is funny, when I have my cane, I feel much more stable and secure.
But, I seldom use it.
Like I said, I am hard headed, and a little forgetful.
I have been diminished by the disease and I am frustrated by that.
The Dementia drugs are not working as well as they once did.
Or more correctly, the disease is more powerful than the drugs.
However I put it, I am slowly going down hill.
Will that speed up.
Only God knows.
And he has a perfect plan for that.
So, I do not worry.
Just the same, I ponder these issues often.
And why not, I have few other things to ponder.
More later.

My GP thinks I should get another Colonoscopy.
I said I would never subject myself, willingly, to that torture agin!
No, not the torture of the procedure.
The torture of the clean out!!
Uck!!
But, it has been 5 or 6 years and I did have a BIG pre-cancerous tumor removed, along with half of my colon, in 2001.
So, I am a great candidate for screening.
Then, she set it up at a medical facility right next to where we live and it happens next Tuesday!!
I guess she thought I would have second thoughts!
Well, I do!
But, my Wife will make sure I do this.
Speaking of my colon surgery.
The Doctor that is doing my Colonoscopy told me, the tumor type I had removed was a particularly aggressive type!
I was never told that before!!
But, I provided them with the lab results of the tumor and that was the basis of their statement.
God blessed me with these 14 years!
I have tried to use them wisely.
But now, the LBD fight is getting difficult.
This, along with issues I cannot specifically figure out, has me on edge, agitated, angry, and out of sorts.
And, my cognitive skills have slipped again.
So, it seems I may be in for a tough time.
I really have not leveled off since the Namenda XR experiment.
I thought I had, but I continue to be a simmering volcano of emotions.
I do my very best to control this and keep it in.
But, it still spills out.
For instance, just now, typing the word "out" I timed "I" instead of "O" three times.
"I" backspace, delete, "I", three times!!
The forth time I nearly punched the "O" through the bottom of the key board!!
Yep, I have anger issues.
I have also written in the recent past, I think, that I now am sure Lewy Body Dementia is gaining the upper hand.
I have fought the good fight, but I am now sure I am loosing!
This revelation is difficult to swallow.
My wife is quiet about this.
We have talked about it, a little.
Mostly, I talked and she listened, agreed quietly, and then we talked about something else.
It is hard for her also.
So, this is what we are dealing with today.
There is no telling what state I will be in tomorrow.
I will continue to cling to the good times and down play the difficult ones.
But, I will also continue to report all conditions, openly, honestly, and with all candor.

There is an old joke about a fellow out on a hike with his friend.
He has to relieve himself and does so next to a bush.
All of the sudden a rattlesnake bites him, you guessed it.
The poor fellow is screaming; "I'm gonna die!!!"
His friend calms him down and tells him he is NOT going to die and to be calm and rest while he goes to town to get a doctor.
While in town, the friend learns the only doctor is on vacation.
He finds an "Old Timer" at the General Store and that fellow tells him;,  If a person is bit by a rattlesnake, you have to make a "X" shaped incision over each fang mark and then suck the poison out!"
The fellow quickly returns to s friend with the rattlesnake bite and tells him:  "Your gonna DIE!!"
Today, I visited my Neurologist.
He is a good, adequate, caring doctor.
He is not Doctor Bowles of Norfolk!
He asked how I was doing and what issues I had.
He also asked if we thought the disease had progressed further.
Then, he asked if I was going to kill someone or myself?!
I have dementia, I am not crazy!!!
If I kill someone, I am going to prison or the death penalty.
Of course, with the length of going to trial, the trial, and the appeals process, I will be so far down the Dementia road, I will not know or care if they put me to death!
Maybe he has a point!!
And as far as committing suicide, well, I intend to stick around as long as I can and be a burden on society!
I paid all these years for Blue Cross, Long Term Insurance,  Social Security, Medicare, and Tricare for Life!!
If I kill myself, I will never collect on these investments!!
So, I am here as long as God has planned for me to be.
I think the Neurologist should pay more attention to my symptoms and less to my demise!

We have been busy the last few days.
A young man we both love and respect graduated from High School in Biloxi, Mississippi and we drove there and back Thursday night, just to support and honor him at his Graduation.
He is our adopted Grandson and he grew up under some less than perfect circumstances.
He overcame them and has become a responsible, young man.
Then today, we had our middle Grandson's High School Graduation.
While we did not have to drive three hundred miles for this graduation, it was still stressful and demanding for me.
Tonight, like most nights, I am experiencing emptiness, loneliness, depression, and a deep need to locate, talk with, and be with Navy shipmates.
These feelings go deep and most ofter leave me in a state of exhaustion and anger.
I am loosing this battle.
I am fighting it alone.
And I am exhausted.

Some folks don't learn things easily!!!
Reread yesterday's post for a refresh.
I need quiet in the morning.
I do not want to hear complaints, orders, reasons why life is bad, or negative issues when I am trying to wake up.
For instance, I got ten minutes on why all the towels we have do not dry her!
The dry me!!
It takes me a while to get myself on an even keel in the morning.
I dream, all night and it is difficult to disengage my mind from my dream state to reality.
These are the truths of LBD.
Learn to live with it!!
Of course, later in the morning I get quizzed on why I am upset!
Reread yesterday's post and you will know why!!!!
I finally explain why.
Like I have before!!
The truth is, LBD has progressed and IS taking over more and more.
But people still treat me like nothing is wrong.
I guess they want me to be "Normal".
Well, I am not "Normal" and I never will be again.
So, again, learn to live with it!!
As you may realize, I am still angry about the recent mornings and the way things have been gong in general for recent time.
Now, I try very hard, to control my anger and keep my emotions in check.
This causes internal stress for me which amplifies everything else!
I recommend everyone who knows me read the Lewy Body Dementia Website to learn about what I am going through and what is coming around the corner.
We have arrived at the real, terrible, issues of LBD!!
Again, learn about it, and then, live with it!!
I am tired of the way I am being treated and dealt with.
I ned to be treated like I have LBD.
Why?!
Because I have LBD!!
I am sure other LBD patients have these issues also.
They, like me, probably do not voice their frustration.
Then, one day, they explode in an emotional diatribe and you, the caregiver, look surprised!
Well, wipe that fake "surprised" look off your self-centered face and educate yourself.
This is serious stuff and we need your help, understanding, and most of all, your full attention!!!
This phase of my LBD journey is more difficult and involves issues that are harder to deal with for me and everyone else.
Sometimes, I believe it would be much easier for me to be in a facility that deals with dementia patients.
Untrained, uneducated, caregivers are not prepared or equipped to help and deal with the issues a LBD patients is experiencing.
Now, realize, I am reacting from two days of emotional upheaval and stress.
But, other caregivers, do you ever wonder why your LBD patient is reacting the way he or she is?
Maybe, I have given you some insight into my issues and emotions.
LBD is not easy, not benign, and not going away.
Again, get educated and deal with your LBD patient where he IS, not where you want or think he is.
Missing the mark here causes big, negative, issues for both of you.

Every morning, I get up before my wife.
I take my thyroid medicine, make the coffee, and check email.
She normally gets up just as I am sitting down to drink my coffee.
As she comes into the living room, I say "Good Morning Beautiful", and then it begins.
You see, my wife's mind NEVER  shuts off!!
She wakes up with this flow of ideas, jobs for me, and list of things I have done wrong.
Then, as she enters the living room, she obviously sees more thing that are my fault.
Funny, nothing is ever HER fault!
As I am trying to drink my coffee, trying to wake up, she is flying around the apartment doing what ever is on her mind, telling me what I have done wrong, and giving me, in rapid succession, my orders for the day!!
If it did not upset me so much it might be funny.
And YES, I have calmly discussed this "Mental Torture" with her on numerous occasions.
I have told her that I need quiet in the morning to get myself awake and on a even keel.
It has not sunk in!
So, every morning is a replay, somewhat like the movie "Groundhog".
Sometimes, I think spouses should not be caregivers.

Friday, my wife had duty in the Azalea Trace Library.
Since Friday is also the day the Azalea Trace bus makes a trip to the Commissary we decided I would shop alone, for the first time in a long time.
No problem, I thought!
Linda mad a very good shopping list to keep me from spending a couple of hundred dollars on impulse buys and I am comfortable with the folks that normally ride the bus on Fridays.
So, off I went, at 8:30, on time, on my own.
The ride over was good and I had a number of friends to talk with.
When we arrived at the Commissary, it was apparent everything was different!
They were having a "Case Lot" sale in the parking lot.
There were lines of people every where!
Change!
My biggest fear had struck.
I proceeded to the Commissary entrance and to my surprise, there was no line.
I showed my Military ID and proceeded to get a basket and shop.
As I read the list, all organized by isle, I became very foggy and uncomfortable.
I continued to follow the list and walk each isle in the order we always follow.
Even though there was nothing on the list in an isle, I followed the familiar path.
As I completed the path and the list, it was time to check out.
I had collected a couple of coupons as I shopped and had a couple with me.
I actually managed to use the correct bank card to pay for the groceries!
Most times, I use the credit card instead of the check card.
Not a big problem, but a mistake that frustrates me.
But, Friday, I did it right.
Then, I had to find the Azalea Trace bus!
The place Frank the driver picks us up was blocked by the "Case Lot" sale.
Where was the bus.
I chose to wait with other residents until we saw the bus approach.
There was safety in numbers.
I bring this story to you to illustrate how frightening it is for a person with dementia to do things that used to be common occurrence.
I was very uncomfortable from the time I saw the parking lot full of tents and case lots of food, paper towels, and canned goods.
Any change is terrifying.
Will I do it again?
Probably.
Will I be any more comfortable?
Most likely not.

I have written before about my hands being "Busy" specially in the evenings.
I pick my face, chew my fingers, pull off scabs or even pull out hair.
I can't stop.
I saw "Busy Blankets" on the internet and I thought one would help me.
My wonderful wife told our Daughter in Law, who is an exceptionally talented quilter.
She set to work to create me a masterpiece and she did.
Today, before our Mother's Day dinner at Azalea Trace, my Daughter in law had our son present MY "Busy Quilt".
She wanted it ti be quietly presented as to mot embarrass me.
She is that thoughtful.
I see my busy quilt as a way to stop or at least slow my picking, biting, and bleeding.
But it also represents love and caring from my Daughter in Law.
I deeply appreciate her gift and will cherish it.
Thanks Juliette.

I can only imagine the stress my wife has to deal with as she deals with me having LBD.
I can see some of the indicators of stress on her and it hurts me to think me and my disease are causing these issues.
I have apologized many times for the circumstances we are in, but she always, graciously, tells me it is not my fault and it is not a problem for her.
Linda is a great wife, friend, and care giver.
I am blessed.
But, I know this is difficult for her.
She had to deal with her father having Alzheimer's and that was just the pre-show for me.
She was once removed from her father's issues since we never lived close to him until he came to live with us after her mother died.
By the, Kurt was well into Alzheimer's and deaf as a wall!
So, communications were limited.
There were some funny moments that we can look back on.
Like the fact that he did not like to wear the new dentures we bought for him, so, he hid them!
Kurt said they were stolen!
We found them after he passed away, hidden in his medicine cabinet!
Nursing homes knew little about dementia's back then, and knew even less about caring for dementia patients.
There were NO drugs to slow the progression of the disease available.
So, the progress was much faster and much more brutal.
Today, many of us slowly slide into the end stages of dementia.
Keeping at least somewhat connected to reality until the end stages.
In my case, I have had four good years of a slow, downward slide.
Very few abrupt drops off a plateau like we experienced with Linda's dad.
Thanks to drug research, my experience has been more gentle and manageable.
However, that slow progression may serve to build the pressure on the caregiver all the more!
Why, it is like waiting for Christmas when you are a child!
You know it is coming, but the anticipation is difficult to take.
Linda knows I am getting worse, she sees it!
Yet, there are days when I am much better.
That up and down progression is a signature feature of LBD.
And, it must be maddening to her.
Why, because she never really knows where I will be at any time of the week or day!
That alone causes stress.
Today is my birthday.
I truly never though I would get this old or be in this medical position.
Of course, God's plan for our lives is not revealed to us.
He knows all, but we operate in the dark, learning each day what God has provided for that moment in time.
Tomorrow is never promised to us.
That truth should make today, the most precious day we have!
This IS the day the Lord has made.
Let us be glad and rejoice in it.
Tomorrow may bring sorrow or joy.
But we have now, today, to enjoy.
Rejoice in that.

Tonight, as I do on most Sunday evenings, I played billiards with some of the men here at Azalea Trace.
It is a great social outlet for me.
The men I play with are exceptional gentlemen and good teachers.
All in all, I enjoy this activity.
But, I see the confusion of my LBD creeping into even my billiards.
From one game to the next, I cannot remember anything.
Who one, how to make shots, or even what balls we are shooting at.
It is very confusing and depressing.
Not because I was once a great billiards player, but that I once had a almost photographic memory!
And now, I can't remember if I zipped my fly.
I have commented before about my recent cognitive degradation.
For instance, I was disoriented at Church today.
Now, that is not totally out of the ordinary since we have a growing congregation and being in a crowd causes me issues.
But, it also illuminates the downward progress of my condition.
The first few years of this journey have been slow.
Yes, there were ups and downs, but the progress was slow.
Now, we see that speeding up.
I guess it makes sense since we are now in the second half of this disease progression.
My son called tonight as he often does.
He always asks me how am doing and I always tell him I am fine.
He knows I am not being completely open about my issues, but he needs to know I am fine with where this is going.
Yes, it upsets and depresses me.
But, I am also dealing with it the best way I can.
So, that's my report of where I am.
It is becoming more difficult for me to convey my thoughts and emotions about this journey.
Some of the emotions are too deep and too personal to write about.
I will try to continue to write and keep you up to dat on my journey.
Thanks for being there.

This morning, like I do every Tuesday morning, I attended a 6AM Men's prayer group at my Church.
16 men meet to pray for each other others, and the Church.
We also have a discussion time.
One of our member's relatives is dealing with Alcoholism.
That individual is in a treatment program and doing well.
Praise God!!
But, we discussed how individuals with addictions have problems staying away from the things they are addicted too.
One important issues is for them to find a totally new friend group.
When I drank, all my friends drank.
Now, none of my friends drink.
Many folks with addictions turn to the Lord for help and salvation.
They go to Church and are shunned!
Why, because they look, act, talk, different.
They were not raised up in the Church so they don't know memory verses, hymns, praise songs, or where John 3: 16 is in the Bible!
So, the regular Church gores shun them and those seeking help from the Church and God's people leave the ONE place they need to be.
I have commented before on my issues with people telling me I am not sick, I do not have dementia, I look and act perfectly fine, and on and on.
They are doing that for the same reason Church people shun addicts!
They don't want to be around them.
Maybe those who do not have an issue don't want to catch an issue from us.
Cancer is OK, they know you can't catch that, even from a toilet seat!
But, maybe they can catch dementia!
Or alcoholism!!
After all, those diseases are dirty!!
People with dementia soil their under ware don't they.
We can't be around people like that.
But, as ling as the "Washed" ones deny I have dementia, they can be around me, at a distance.
And tat is ho people treat me, from distance!
If I hide my disease, I am being dishonest and not transparent!
I thought, as a Christian, honesty was the only way to be.
Evidently, not so.
Even here in Azalea, I feel a coldness from folks that I have told about my disease.
Yet, we see and talk to a number of folks that have early signs of dementia.
Trust me, if you have dementia or you are the spouse of someone with dementia, you can see the signs.
But, if they deny it,they are OK!
So, they lie to themselves or others, and they are accepted.
I once told you I felt very much at home in a Memory Support facility we looked at before we moved to Azalea.
I really think I should have insisted I move there, either then!!
That was the most comfortable and accepted I felt in a long time.
Why, because I was with my kind!
SO, no I understand why I am treated the way I am.
I figured it out!

Those of you who knew me before I came to the saving knowledge of Jesus Christ knew me as a wild man.
But, Jesus changed me a through the power of the Holy Spirit.
I am a totally different person and because of that, I am secure in my life and my eternity.
LBD has effected me.
The effects of LBD caused me to retire earlier than we had planned.
It also caused my wife to retire 5 years earlier than she planned.
LBD also lead to a completely unplanned, unexpected move to Florida to be close to our son and his family.
While all of these changes were unexpected, but they worked out to n\be positives.
Just like God planned!
You see, God is never surprised and never runs into unexpected circumstances, even though we do!
And while we had to leave our home Church and all our friends in Virginia, we have grown personally and spiritually here in Florida.
These thought came to me while I was sitting in my power lift chair, listening to George Jones and Vestil Goodman sing country gospel music, petting my oldest poodle.
If God can care enough about an old drunk like George Jones.
Enough to lead him to salvation, we all have the opportunity to seek salvation.
God changed me and leads me through the life's challenges, you too can have this surety of eternal life.
Tomorrow, I will stand in for the Azalea Trace Chaplain and lead the weekly Tuesday Chapel Service.
Many of the attendees are wheel chair bound, have dementia, or have other debilitating, life threatening diseases, yet they seek the comfort Jesus and depend on God for everything in their lives.
That alone, gives me peace.
So, how do I hang on to happiness and peace dealing with LBD.
I depend on God, for everything.
It has worked for me and I know it will work for you.
Seek ye FIRST, the kingdom of God, and all these things will be added to you!

This is an important question from the point of the LBD patient.
I see couples holding hands.
hugging, kissing, and having their arm around each other.
I see wives rubbing their husband's necks and twirling their hair.
These are acts of intimacy between a husband and wife that express love, sexual acceptance, and an intimate connection that we need, no matter our age to medical condition.
But, I have observed that the opposite is true.
Why?
Well, first of all, those of us with LBD and other dementia's loose our sexual function due to the disease.
Our mates then think that loss of sexual function displays our dislike for intimate contact.
Nothing could be farther from the truth.
I need, cry out for, and deeply desire intimate contact from my wife.
It brings back fond memories of when I was young and healthy.
Many times, I find myself thinking; "I need to have sex with my wife."
Of course, the realities of the disease prevent this.
But, the intimacy that leads up to that act is still needed and wanted.
Dementia of any type is a lonely disease.
You are trapped inside your mind, in another time zone.
Many times, old friends and family avoid you.
Visits, invitations, and telephone calls become few and far between.
Even your spouse struggles to find ways to communicate with you.
I can see that.
On the outside, I am not the same man I was before LBD.
But, inside, I am the same man with all the same needs.
The real problem is, how do I communicate that to her?
Trust me, it is more difficult than you might imagine.
So, I fall deeper into my internal dementia time zone.
Having this disease has permitted me to finally understand why my Father in Law acted the way he did.
The big difference is, I now have a point of reference for him and me, and I can communicate these emotions with others.
My hope is, others will learn and add to this knowledge to actually help LBD patients and caregivers.
I deeply miss those days of loving intimacy.
If you are the spouse of a LBD or other Dementia patient, take heed.

I have recently written that my experience with LBD has moved further down the road.
That is even more apparent to me now.
The last couple of days, I have felt lost and isolated.
Things seem far away and I am disconnected from the here and now.
This is dementia!
Now I understand where my Father in Law was, so many tears ago when he suffered with Alzheimer's.
No one knew how to help him then, and there were no drugs like Namenda and Arecept.
They just tied him i his chair to prevent him from wandering.
Much has changed, yet much has not.
I can still function in our apartment.
But, I am not here, I am somewhere else.
I recognize my wife and I still interact with people.
But that is a chore for me now.
I once was very out going.
Now, I would much rather be insulated in the cocoon of my mental world.
This is dementia, finally coming into full bloom.
I think it will be comfortable for me.

Today, we had a water leak.
We noticed it when we got up from our afternoon nap.
It was after normal working hours, so I called the maintenance number.
In a matter of minutes, Security was in our apartment doing an assessment of the situation.
After determining that the leak was a condensate drain issue Security called in the duty maintenance man and he was here in less than 20 minutes!
Mean while, Security showed up with a shop vacuum and began cleaning up the water!
Our Security folks are wonderful people that are our life lines.
If someone signals a medical emergency,  Security is there.
If there is an after hours maintenance issue, Security personnel do the preliminary troubleshooting.
Many times they solve the issue, immediately.
Even if your car has a dead battery, Security comes to the rescue.
All of this, while making security rounds, throughout the community.
Again, they are our life lines!!
Back to the leak.
The maintenance man, Mark, discovered the problem in less that 15 minutes and had it repaired in less that 30 minutes.
Then, he and the Security person tested to make sure the condensate drain was working correctly and cleaned up after themselves.
Why do we choose to live in a Continuing Care Retirement Community like Azalea Trace?
Because Continuing Care not only means all the medical possibilities are covered and provided for, but the emergencies and daily maintenance issues are dealt with.
If we owned a home, we might still be waiting for a plumber or AC&R technician.
Or, I could crawl up in the attic and try to find the issue.
Oh, wait, I am not allowed on ladders anymore.
Today just cemented in my mind that we did the right thing.
Thanks Azalea!

If you do not read my Navy bolt, you do not know that I was having some minor, but irritating, issues with our CCRC.
Now, this is a beautiful place to live and as it turned out, I was probably a major part of the issues.
So, I learned a few things today and I wanted to copy the final post a bout these issues on my LBD blog as well.
As those of you know, I have been experiencing anger and agitate issues ad I have progressed down the LBD road.
This was very apparent as this situation played out.
So, here is that post for your info; We had our meeting with the Executive Director of Azalea Trace this afternoon.
I must admit, he was a very congenial and honest person.
He explained some events that lead up to him and us not meeting or forging a relationship and I agreed with him on those points.
Right up front, we both agreed that if we had started out on the right foot, this disagreement would not have happened because we would have had an open line of communications.
We have now established that circuit.
That being said, he completely answered my issues concerning the parking lot issues.
We did differ on the treatment of certain members of our community.
But, it is OK to have different opinions.
The bottom line her is, I honestly believe the parking issues will be solved, to the betterment of the community, very soon.
The truth is, based on our written question, the ED was already working on the solution.
I did encourage him to publicize the actions from the Resident Meetings on the Community Cable Channel or an email to the residents.
This would help at least me, if not most of the residents keep informed.
Waiting a month for an update seems sort of secretive.
Especially when he and his staff are actually solving the issue in a timely manner.
Why NOT take credit for your good work.
Open, frequent, informative, communications serve to beat down rumors and soothe bruised egos.
Our refrigerator issue was a little different.
It seems I did not hear the entirety of the first offer from the ED to solve our problem.
This is where I learned something today.
I either did not hear what Ginger told me or I confused what she said with my own view.
Either way, it is entirely possible that I caused the misunderstanding and I am very sorry about that.
In any case, he was very understanding and helpful concerning our refrigerator issue.
He even came to our apartment to see the problem  and after seeing it, he commented;  That would be very annoying."
In any case, we will be able to remedy this problem too.
If you read my Lewy Body Dementia blog, you know I have been having anger and agitation issues.
In his defense, the ED did not know this or even that I had LBD.
That relates back to our not meeting in the beginning.
So, another thing I learned today is, from now on, Linda will have to take the lead on these issues.
My brain can no longer logically look at issues without interjecting the emotion of the moment into the mix.
To keep peace in the community and our life, it makes sense for me to completely remove myself from these negotiations.
This has turned out to be a very draining and upsetting situation that I most likely caused.
I probably caused Ginger and her boss, Dave, more problems than I am worth.
Not to to mention the indigestion I caused the ED.
But, we are all on the same sheet of music and I learned a few things.
So, it was not a total loss.
Now, I think I will just sit down and shut up.
Good night.

Yes, I have something to tell each of you that I know you do not want to hear.
But, it is part of dealing with my journey with Lewy Body Dementia.
I had a neurologist in Virginia that asked me; "Have you dealt with your disease yet?"
I quickly replied; "Yes!"
She quickly replied; "Bullshit!
No you haven't!"
She was right.
Now, four years later, and much farther down the road called Lewy Body Dementia, that question came back into my mind during this recent grumpy, agitated, angry, phase.
While alone with myself, arguing with my disease, it came to me;  "I am going to die!"
OK, someone pick my Son up and revive him!
He is still in denial and that statement probably sent him to the deck!
But, it is true.
Since Linda and I have seen my disease progress over the last couple months, I have more and more, realized this disease, LBD, will lead to my death.
Now, that is somewhat of a surprise seeing that I always thought I would die in a blaze of glory in a gun mount on a ship!
We all know that did not happen.
But, Psalm 139 tells us; All the days of my life were written in God's book before we were formed in our mother's womb.
So, God is not surprised about anything including our death!
My Dad, who was not a religious man at all, used to say;  "On the back of your Birth Certificate is you Death Certificate, all filled out, in invisible ink!"
So, relating to Dr. Fuentes in Virginia, Yes, I now have fully dealt with the reality of my disease.
I realize it will lead to my death, sooner than later.
I realize I am further down the road that I was four years ago.
And I realize, that my death will happen.
When, I cannot say.
Remember, it is written in invisible ink!
Goof thing God can read invisible ink!

 I wrote a post on the Navy blog that related customer service to command climate and it all related to my perception of how we are being treated here at Azalea Trace.
Now, don't get me wrong.
This is a good place to be.
But, even a little but under a big horses saddle causes issues.
And, those little things, combined with how I am doing in the LBD journey are making me very difficult to be around.
Then, add the fact that I have a cold, and I probably should be confined in solitary confinement.
That being said, it is becoming harder and harder to be congenial to anyone.
Of course, I reserve all my energy to be kind and loving to my Wife.
She has earned that And I intend to treat her with love, respect, and honor, until my last breath!
However, other people might want to give me a wide berth.
Mostly that is not an issue, since no one ever visits us anyway.
However, my Sister is planning a visit towards the end of the month, so I hope I am doing better by then.
No promises!
For instance, I only got about two hours of sleep last nigh because of this cold.
We decided to take a nap, but the dogs had other ideas.
They wanted out, walked, fed, petted, and now I am here, in my chair, writing to keep my sanity, while my wife blissfully sleeps.
I am glad for her since she is showing signs of this cold too.
I just wish I was sleeping too.
And that, angers me, as you might imagine.
Would that have been an issue before LBD and all the issues that accompany that disease.
Probably, but I would not be ready to punch someone in the nose for walking past our apartment holding a conversation at 1000 decibels!!!!!
Jerks!!
I could say this too will pass.
But I know it won't.
This is the new normal and I pity my wife because of it.
She spent the first half of our marriage with me being a grumpy, impatient, loud, obnoxious, jerk.
Then, because of God, I calmed down,  And, for the past 10 years or so, I have been pretty calm and gentle.
That period of quiet seems t be done.
I don't even watch the news anymore because I get so upset over the treason that is going on in our government!
But, I have come to the realization that I cannot do anything about it.
So, I try to ignore it.
So far, so good, I think!
Grumpy, agitated and angry have been a theme for a number of posts.
But, it is where I am right now and I pledged to write the truth.
There it is.
The unvarnished truth.
And the truth is, these two blogs are the one outlet I have for my anger and agitation.
I am glad I have them.
</doc>
<doc date=Monday, April 6, 2015>
When someone asks me how I am doing, I normally say;  I am as well as I can be.
That, of course, is a lie!
But, I understand most folks do not want for know how I really am.
First of all, it would take me 15 minutes to give them an update.
Second, "How are you doing?"
is a question that really does not beg an answer.
It is the same as "Hi or Good Morning"  Third, people in general are just not that interested in how anyone but themselves, are doing!
So, people with long term diseases lie!
But, the truth is, I am doing worse than ever with now expectation of doing any better.
Tonight, while we were picking up our dinner, I got extremely agitated and angry.
As we walked back to our apartment I told my wife I did not see any improvement from the Namenda XR experiment.
For the first time, she agreed!
Now, Linda has steadfast hung on to he belief that I was getting better since I was taken off Namenda XR and placed back on Namenda, twice a day.
Now, she admits I did not rebound and as I thought, She agrees I will not.
So, as I wrote a while back, this is the new normal.
And, it is not a pretty new normal.
But, it is the reality of Lewy Body Dementia.
And we have had a long run of drugs working and me slowly progressing.
Now, she has a grouch, stuck in his past, with a short fuze anger, to deal with!
I pity her.
Add to the anger and agitation my leg pain and instability issues and we see the future picture.
I really cannot tell most folks the truth.
Why?
Some say, you don't look sick, or you look like you are doing well.
Or other statements of doubt or ,ore directly, calling me a liar.
I ask you, since I do not want or solicit sympathy, why would I lie about having this disease?
Why would  have limited my income potential?
Why would I take a big tax hit to move into a continuing care retirement community that does not eve offer assigned parking?
And why haven't I punched someone in the nose because I am so angry.
No, I only tell my closest friends the truth.
I may never change that policy.
But, the time may come when I can no longer maintain my facade.

<doc date=Monday, March 30, 2015>
I was sitting in the bathroom, thinking, and it came to me;  I am handling Lewy Body Dementia way too well and people don't believe that I am ill because of my "Hacker" personality!
It is true.
I do not complain openly.
Yes, I bring my issues to this forum.
But, when someone asks how I am doing, I always say; "Outstanding".
I always have a joke or a funny story to tell anyone who will listen.
I am bright and engaged, or at least I try to look that way.
And what does all this get me?
Condemnation!
People deny I am ill, call me a liar, indirectly, and do not see my issues.
Truthfully, I get very aggravated about this treatment.
Since I joined the Navy, I have always been a "Hacker".
Truthfully, I became a hacker even when I late in my youth because of my family circumstances.
But, the Navy showed me that "Hackers" advanced, were liked, and were depended on.
And since, early in "Boot Camp" I decided I FIT in the Navy, I wanted to be what the Navy wanted me to be!!
That carried over to my Civil Service career and into this disease.
and because of that, I get short changed in the treatment I get from others.
Even family members.
And while I do not want people doting all over me, I would like some recognition of the effort I put into dealing with LBD.
Am I an invalid?
Not yet.
But I am handicapped in may ways.
But, that fact goes fundamentally unrecognized.
And I feel shortchanged over that.
I suppose I am just whining.
Recently, I have let down my guard, so to speak, since fighting LBD has become more than I can continue.
But still, I get little recognition.
Maybe, they just don't care.
Or, maybe, as I have written before, they do not understand.
Whatever the case, I am on the short, very stinky, end of the stick.
Note:  I can hear you say:  Boy, that a wuss!
He is really trying to get sympathy.
or something along those lines.
And, I understand your point.
But, look at mine.
I live in a retirement community with may folks dealing with health issues.
Yet, when my disease comes up i get: No, there's nothing wrong with you.
That's not a real disease.
I never heard of that.
The doctors must be wrong!
And other condescending replies!!
This happens all the time!!
I have received these comments of unbelief at best and "Your a Liar" at worst, from acquaintances  and family too.
Now, my friends, those of you who have stood beside me, through think and thin.
You have always been there for me.
So, don't think I lump you in this group.
But, in my new State, I meet many more doubters than acceptors.
My pastor here, actually asked me often, how I am dealing with LBD.
I appreciate that.
But, he is THE ONLY PERSON who ever asks that question here in Florida.
Yes, I get calls and emails from you, my friends, like Jerry, Steve, CJ, Cathy, Jim, Don, Big Head, and others.
But, with the exception of my Foster Sister, not one relative has ever asked how I was doing.
So, you can see my point.
I guess I am feeling sorry for myself.
But, I believe I have a right too.

It is worth the study to see how constant pain impacts one's mental picture.
I have had leg pain.
off and on, due to my LBD for quite a while.
In the past, the pain has been limited to the evenings.
But recently my leg pain has been almost constant, along with upper arm pain and some neck pain.
In the evenings, my leg pain increases to the point that I am now taking some pain medicine.
And if you know me, you will know I do not take pain meds unless I am in extreme pain.
I have also told you I have been having issues with increased agitation and anger.
I have connected that to my recent experiment with Namenda XR since the anger and agitation increased right after I started taking that new drug.
But, there may be a contributory cause in the leg pain.
I don't know and it is hard for me to definitively tell.
The point is, being in constant pain must be contributing to my issues.
I am also having increased stability issues when walking in the open.
Walking down the hallways here at Azalea I do OK.  We have grab rails if I need them.
But, for instance, today walking in the gravel Church parking lot, I had issues with my feet shuffling while walking.
That made me unstable.
Oh well, more challenges to overcome!
</doc>
<doc date=Friday, March 27, 2015>
I have not yet recovered from the changes I experienced with Namenda XR.
I am still very agitated and angry.
My memory is still FUBAR, and I am depressed to a level I have never seen.
If I stay in this state for much longer, I will have to admit, and my wife will also, that this is the new norm.
I really do not see any chance of this getting better.
My wife told me today that she does not want me to take any other new drugs!
She said, that she wants me to stay on what I now take, but no other changes or additions.
I agree with her.
I realize all of us with Dementia of any kind are lab rats for the medical industry.
We are the first generation with drugs to combat Dementia and the producers of the drugs really do not know what the effect and impact of the drugs on humans will be over a mid to long period of time.
We saw the same careless experimentation on women in the 1960's with birth control pills and hormone therapy.
And we all know how well that turned out.
And before that, in the 1950's was the use of thalidomide for fertility issues!
I do not expect a better out come for me.
But, there is no other choice except for not taking drugs and going down hill much faster than I am.
Or at least I think I would be going down hill faster than I am.
Maybe, the drugs are doing more harm than good.
But, how can I tell.
There is no "Control Group" that I know of in this experiment.
I find myself thinking more and more about my life in the Memory Support facility.
I actually long for that security and isolation.
Right now, I am not in a good place mentally.
I hope tomorrow is better.

How does the doctor or psychologist really know what the patient is telling the truth when they ask those questions like;  Are you suicidal?
Are you homicidal?
I ask this question because of the recent airline disaster in Europe.
But it is based in my own experiences.
For instance, those tests we took in the Military.
You know, the ones that judges our emotions about certain "Hot" topics.
I knew what answers they were looking for and which answers would flag me as a risk, crazy, or the best person for the job!
The same applies on the Spiritual Gifts Tests that many Churches use.
I can make myself look like Billy Graham or Jim Jones, depending on how I answer the questions and I KNOW what answers they are poking for.
So, when I am in the doctors office, how DOES he know I am honestly answering those questions.
Since I know what answers will cause me to be institutionalized, and which ones will guarantee my freedom.
So, the question is;  Who know the mental health of the individual in question?
Certainly the individual impacted does.
At least in the early stages of depression.
I certainly knew when I was depressed and that is was impacting my job performance and my life.
But, I present that those closest to you may know before the individual that you are suffering from mental problems.
My friend at work, Don Bolick, knew two years before anyone else that I was having dementia issues and depression!
When I became too confused to do my job, Don helped me decide to retire on a disability.
The truth is, he carried me in my job for a long time.
My Wife knew and was reticent to confront me with what she knew.
But, when I asked for help, she took the lead to get me the medical assistance I desperately needed.
In my case, I was the last person to accept the suggestion of depression.
I fought it and saw that diagnosis as dehumanizing and emasculating.
I was a Master Chief Gunner's Mate.
Rough, tough, smart, ready for anything!!
The truth was and is, I was a broken human being in need of help, understanding, and medical assistance.
My point and premise of this post is to alert you, the caregivers and family members of individuals with Dementia of any type.
We will not always be honest and forthcoming about out mental issues.
As a matter of fact, we will discuss sexual dysfunction before we will discuss, honestly and openly, our mental problems!!
So, YOU have to see our problems and confront us about them.
You have to make the hard decisions about weapons in the home, wandering, driving, and independent movement.
And, YOU must make the decision to place us in a facility that can tend, 24/7/365.
to our needs!!
While this is one of the most difficult and personal posts I have ever written.
But, as this disease progresses, I must be honest for the benefit of anyone reading my Blog.
So, there it is!
I hope this helps someone make the right decision for your loved one.

I have talked about having issues with controlling urine and solid waste.
It seems now that I get NO forewarning as to having to GO!
Tonight, we went out to dinner with our Son's in-laws.
It was his brother in-laws birthday.
We know all of our Son's sister in-laws and their husbands and we like them.
So, this was a very enjoyable evening.
The restaurant was about 15 minutes from our retirement community.
When we left the restaurant I did not have to go.
When we got home, the loyal doggy duo needed to go out.
I felt no emergency to go, although I knew I would have to go in the near future.
So, we took the dogs out and after about 5 minutes, I realized that I was in extremes!!
I had to Go!
Now!!
Now, my wife is not comfortable with me going behind something to hide and relieve myself.
No peeing on the trees!!
So, we started walking back to our apartment, quickly.
It became painfully apparent I was not going to make it!!
I could no longer control the leakage and I was wetting my pants, in uncontrollable pressurized leaks.
I dashed into the building before ours and, leaking all the way, I made it to the public bathroom on the first floor.
My underwear and Levis were soaked!
I walked home, now unpressurized, and told my wife of my accident!
Now, she understands and is sympathetic.
I have resisted wearing adult incontinence products, but the is the second time in two days that I am washing soiled clothes.
Yes, last night, I woke up with soiled skivvies.
I know that my LBD is causing this.
It is one of the issues that occur about half way down the LBD road.
And, that is where I am.
But, know, and understanding, does not make the frustration and embarrassment go away.
But, it is time to man up and buy some adult incontinence products.
Since I suffer from both urine and solid waste issues, throw away skivvies are the only thing that will work.
I will let you know my choice and how they work.
How in-depth my report will be.
It just Depends!
</doc>
<doc date=Monday, March 23, 2015>
I have learned that no matter how much others try, not matter how much they really care, they do not understand what a LBD patient is going through!
It is not because they are dense, stupid, or self-centered.
It is because, like child birth, back surgery, or shingles, you have to experience it to understand it!
Today, we went to a new dentist.
A practice very close to the retirement community we live in.
It was recommended to us by a number of the residents here and they were right.
A very gentles hygienist and dentist.
A pleasant staff, and we were totally impressed.
My wife explained what I had and how it impacted me.
When the hygienist and dentist came in to treat me, they were complete ignorant of what LBD was or how it manifested itself, even though my wife gave them a good briefing.
The question is: Why were they so lost on about LBD?
The answer is, they just don't understand.
I guess if I were drooling on my shirt and peeing in my pants, they would have understood.
And trust me, I was close on both counts today.
But, the only time I got agitated was when I was filling out the new patient forms.
They kept asking me the same questions, sheet after sheet!!
I actually BARKED at the receptionist!!
I have no apologies for her.
They should change those repetitive, stupid, forms.
And, they should understand I have LBD with a major in Dementia!!
Just look at my meds!!!
But, think about it.
I am this agitated and angry with a major dose of meds to control that.
What would I be without those drugs!!
Maybe they should recall me to active duty, take me off my meds, and send me to fight ISIL!!
On the meds, I am ready to strangle most people.
Oh well, those who do not HAVE LBD just cannot understand what we are going through.
It is not their fault, they just cannot understand what they have not personally experienced.
So, I try to remain calm, they to educate those who seem interested, and try not to choke those who don't.
These thing keep me busy, all the time.

We had friends from Church over tonight for dinner in the dinning room of Azalea Trace.
We had a great dinner and the tour of the campus.
We then went to our apartment and socialized.
I dominated the conversation and all I could talk about was Navy and my Navy experience.
It is a good thing our guests were career Navy.
The difference is, He served in the Navy as a career.
I lived Navy and still do.
More and more, all I think about is Navy.
With the exception of my Ministry at Bay Breeze Assisted Living Facility, I might as well be in the Navy!
I even find myself discussing, in my mind, whether I should "Put in my papers" to retire!
I have written before about the experience I had, while my wife was at her Bible Study, I hallucinated that I was on a ship, in the gun mount, discussing the fact that the Gunner's Mates we not doing Pre-Fire procedures correctly.
I was talking out loud, walking around, in my mind, on the ship!
The folks I worked with as a Civil Servant used to say that I never took my uniform off when I retired from active duty.
The real truth is, I never retired in my mind and I have not retired yet.
And, as my LBD progresses, and it is progressing, I am more and more living in the Navy!
I cannot talk to someone without checking their pedigree.
What service, Officer, Enlisted, Surface, Air, Submarine, Duty stations, and the other question; "Did you know so and so?"
I realized tonight that I am much worse off mentally, than even I thought.
When Linda and I are home alone, I seldom talk about anything but Navy.
Not even cars, houses, being a survivalist or guns!
I am  almost totally entrenched in my Navy experience.
The revelation that came to me tonight shook me.
I am farther down the Lewy Body road than I thought.
This thing is winning, and I am soon to be lost in my Navy thoughts.
Oh well, at least it was a time I look upon fondly.

OK, the Psychiatrist that runs my drugs told me to stop taking Namenda XR and go back to the twice a day Namenda.
That was last Friday.
The negative effects have NOT subsided!!
If anything, I may be even MORE agitated and angry.
This is not a good thing, trust me.
If you remember, I got very angry when we lived in the Senior's Apartment in Virginia and almost caused some people bodily harm!!
Presently, I am maintaining my cool.
But I hope this wears off soon.
Another issue, that may or may not be related to the Namenda XR.
The pain in my legs has become almost unmanageable.
My legs hurt all the time.
And any pain that does not subside becomes an issue.
I have not taken any pain meds yet, but that is soon to change if this does not go away.
I have explained before that LBD is a "Plateau" disease.
I believe I have fallen of the plateau I was on for quite a while and dropped to a "new normal" because of the Namenda XR experiment.
That is the nature of this disease and I expect it.
That does not make it easier to deal with.
However, it is the fact and nature of this disease, and I am sure my disease has taken me to the next, lower, level.
More to come.

<doc date=Saturday, March 14, 2015>
Well, we called the doctor that prescribes my psychotropic drugs and he told us to stop the Namenda XR and go back to regular Namenda.
That shift started yesterday and we have not seen any change in me, yet.
I am still grumpy and agitated and my cognitive abilities have not improved.
But, we hope those issues will subside.
However, they may not.
That is the truth of LBD.
Some changes stay!
We will see how this goes.
</doc>
<doc date=Tuesday, March 10, 2015>
Today, I actually feel like I have Dementia!
Yes, I know I have had LBD for a while.
And yes, I knew it was progressing.
But, the last few days, I have really been disconnected and cognitively slow.
This may be from my change to Namenda XR, or it may be a new progression of the disease.
I just do not know.
But, it is definitely a significant downward turn and that is upsetting.
We have an appointment with the neurologist next month.
So, this will be the main topic of conversation, if I remember it!
We will see.
More later.

<doc date=Sunday, March 8, 2015>
This week, I started taking Namenda XR.
I have been on Namenda, twice a day, for a long time.
But, my doctor decided Namenda XR would be easier for me.
He said, the difference was it was "Timed Release" and I would only have to take it once a day.
Big deal!
I take eight pills in the morning, and twelve in the evening.
One pill more in the evening is no big deal.
But, I do what my doctor says, until it causes me issues.
And Namenda XR may be causing me issues.
What are the symptoms?
I have been much more grumpy and agitated, starting about two days after the medicine change, according t my wife.
I am also much more cognitively impaired.
I am more foggy and disconnected mentally.
I guess we will sat the course for another week or so to see if these issues subside.
If not, we will talk to the prescribing physician and ask to go back n regular, twice a day, Namenda.
The last thing my wife needs is me more grouchy and agitated than I normally am.
And I do not like feeling more cognitively compromised.
So, we will see what we will see.

I have told you before that I have Lewy Body Dementia.
I spend much of the time thinking about my time in the Navy.
What I have not told you is that every week I spend at least an hour on the telephone with my dearest friend, GMC Jerry Hart.
I first met Jerry as a student at Gun School.
He was a NAVVET student converting from Corpsman to Gunner's Mate.
We were stationed together later in our career when he became the Gunner's Mate E-5 and below and schools detailer.
Jerry is a consummate professional.
A dedicated Navy man and lover and he and I became life long friends.
Jerry knows what I am going through and every week we talk for as long as I need to get back on an even keel.
It does not matter what we talk about, Navy becomes the topic.
Most of the time, Jerry mentions an event that I remember and off I go.
Cussing and discussing the events of my Navy experiences as I remember them.
Then, when I wind down, Jerry skillfully interjects another issue that HE KNOWS I will react too.
And off I go again.
Jerry is better at therapy than my Psychologist was!!
Today, as is the norm, Jerry called me and we talked for an hour and 26 minutes!!
It is heaven for me.
A release from my LBD problems and a trip down memory lane.
Jerry has his own health problems, yet he is such a good friend, that he worries about me more than himself.
There is a Bible verse that says: "a friend sticks closer than a brother."
Jerry is that friend for me.
Jerry has put up with my ambitions, my self-centered nature, and all of my quirks and never complained.
He is closer to me than any blood relative.
Jerry has carried me farther than I have gone on my own.
I appreciate him, respect him, and love him as a brother.
This is a topic I should have written on before.
Tonight, my head has been full of my thoughts of Jerry and our friendship.
I am a luck man to have him as my friend.

There are days, like today, that I feel totally depleted mentally and physically.
Mentally, I have difficulty paying attention, my hands cannot stop moving, I see things as if I was looking through a tube or a tunnel, and motion around me causes me to jump.
Physically, my legs hurt, I feel weak, and I get tired walking any distance.
My stomach is painfully full from dinner, even though I did not eat anymore than I do at any dinner.
All in all, I feel like a wreck!
Why, I really do not know.
What I do know is I hope I feel better tomorrow.
I will go to sleep early tonight.
I often wonder if this is a temporary issue or another step in the progression.
Feeling weak, overwhelmed, and mentally fuzzy and confused, is very upsetting.
So, we will continue to monitor.
More later, Another thought after I closed;  All day, I have had difficulty breathing.
Not great difficulty, but a resistance when I inhale.
It seems I cannot get enough air in.
All in all, I feel puny!

Dementia is a difficult disease to manage,  Trust me.
Before I was affected by LBD, I was a hot head!
I could reduce most people to a puddle of tears just with my yelling.
Then, if that did not accomplish what I wanted, I could move on to more violent measures.
Back, before LBD, I could turn on and turn off my anger.
But, with the onset of LBD, I must control myself, all the time!
You may remember that back in Virginia, I got aggravated with a family moving into our retirement apartments and I lost my temper, BIG TIME!!
I was ready and willing to fight, anyone or all of them at once.
Then, I went over and verbally assaulted the management staff!
Needless say, I learned then that I cannot let my emotions dictate how I act.
Why, because, with dementia, the authorities are more than likely going to place me somewhere that I cannot hurt myself or someone else.
So, I now take extraordinary measures to control my emotions.
For instance, I seldom watch the news.
Why?
You know why.
I do not read political news on the Internet.
And I seldom discuss the state of our country with others.
No, I prefer to live in my world.
It is safer for me and those around me.
I realize some of you may be cringing right now.
But, I believe I am being responsible.

I have been dealing with increased depression and apathy for the last few weeks.
Things upset me and set me off in a way that causes me concern.
Today, while my wife was at BSF,  I went to the community Coffee Klatch to talk to some folks.
I left that time angry and upset.
I truly cannot tell you why, but I am spun up!
And this is happening more and more.
Little things upset me and then I dwell on them and get even more angry.
I have little desire to be social and times like this reinforce that emotion.
Nothing seems to be right in my life right now.
Not that I can put my finger on any specific thing.
I am just upset, unhappy, and very angry, at everything and almost everyone.
I try diligently to control these negative emotions, holding the in, and trying to be polite and kind to everyone around me.
But, I would truly like to punch some of these folks, none specific, in the nose!
I can't tell you what anti-depressants I take, but they obviously are not working!!
I do not know what to do.
And I really don't have the desire to go through the inquisition a doctor will put me through to get help.
So, I am at an impasse.
Oh well, it does not matter as long as I can control myself and appear to be normal.
It is hard to see through the fog of LBD.
So, I really do not know where I am going anymore.

I was sitting here thinking about all the lies we tell everyday.
Those everyday questions we have learned the "Correct" answers too.
Like what?
You already know many of them.
For instance;  How are you doing today?
Up answer; Fine, never felt better.
But, in you mind, behind that social filter, you would like to answer;  My ass hurts, and I have to deal with a toad like you!
Then there are those questions you don't dare answer truthfully.
Like; Honey, are you happy?
Go on, answer that one truthfully.
Or, Do you take this woman to be your wife, until death do you part?
You said; I do.
But in you mind, behind those social filters you said;  Hell no!
What am I doing?
Boy am I screwing up!!
Where's the exit?
Will anyone see me leave?
Boy am I screwed!!
And finally; I didn't know this was a death sentence?!
Until DEATH do we part?!
No, we do not answer questions honestly in polite society.
Too bad, because life would be much better if we did.
If we were able to be honest with our spouse, our friends, our co-workers.
Like when you wife asks; Does this dress make me look fat?
You know damn all you can't touch that one with a ten foot pole!
Or, Does she look sexier than I do?
You answer, no, or not to me, or, she's too young, or some other lame excuse.
But what is really going through your mind?
Now, do our wives have the same social filter issues.
I am sure they do.
But, we continue to deceive each other.
And we get mad at Politicians!
Now, those of us with Dementia, have damaged or even completely broken social filters.
So, when one of us tells the truth, you just let is pass as part of the disease.
I guess that's good.
But, it is a lie too.
I'm not sure I like polite society anymore.
Maybe I will just tell the truth as I see it from now on.
People around me will give me a pass and I will feel better.
Sounds good to me.

More and more, the things I care about and are interested in, are diminishing, rapidly.
I cannot tell you why, but I clearly know it is happening.
I have all but stopped paying attention to the news because I see our Nation destroying itself.
What I did for 40 years turns out to be a waste of time.
Under the leadership of our President, America is becoming  a Muslim Nation filled with illegal aliens that have MORE rights than I do.
Illegal aliens can even vote in  our elections!!
We celebrate all that is reprehensible and immoral.
Gays, drug users, multiple sex partners, unemployed people that just don't want to work, socialists, just about anything that used to be immoral and wrong is now celebrated.
Our Military, MY Navy, has been reduced to a dating service for ghays and sexually perverted people.
We have less than half of the capability we had when I left active duty.
We care more about preserving some perverts rights than upholding morals and good leadership and discipline.
The constant drive for combat readiness has been replaced by political correctness.
And, if you get drunk, you are worse than scum, but if you get aids from having sex with someone the same sex as you, you are a hero.
Everything that was good is bad and everything that was bad, os good and celebrated.
I am tired of being blamed for all that is wrong.
I followed the rules, did my best, and stood up for what was right.
Now, I am the reason the world is going to hell.
Add this to the effects of LBD and I am defeated.
My legs hurt continuously, I have difficulty breathing, aspirate, forget my most recent thoughts, and feel weak and diminished.
I am tired of peeing in my pants.
I am tired of not being helped and forgotten of by many who I helped for so long.
Ole people, especially, those with an illness, are an inconvenience to most people.
see that in the Assisted Living Facility we have our ministry in.
Most of those folks have no one that visits them or comes to help them.
The are alone and forgotten.
I have had shipmates that I came into contact with either through my blogs or though my contacting them that say;  I thought you were dead.
That is always hard to hear.
This may be one of those LBD low points that happen so often.
Or, maybe it is the new normal, seeing as it ha sin creased over the last week or so.
I am not happy with much of anything and see no reason to try to change that.
I really never thought I would be in this condition and I never considered that America would destroy herself.
Heck, I never thought I would live this long.
Goes to show you what I know.

Just to keep everyone updated.
Linda is doing well.
He "Black Eye" is too!
Wow!
The shape of her glasses is completely black.
It covers her entire eye are.
Even where her glasses bridge touched her nose is black.
Now, the bruising is moving down and out.
When this is done, the entire right side of her face will be bruised.
Yet, surprisingly, she does not have much pain.
I am glad.
We have carried out a normal schedule today.
We even walked!
And everyone her at Azalea Trace has asked how she is doing.
The Nurse even called this morning to check on Linda.
What a wonderful community.
Tomorrow, we will go to Church.
What else would we do on Sunday?
Life goes on.
Thanks for your prayers.
</doc>
<doc date=Friday, February 6, 2015>
Today, we had a busy day planned.
An outing with fellow Azalea Trace residents bowling at 9AM, followed by a possible trip to the Commissary, follower by a 2:15 PM eye doctor appointment for my wife.
A busy schedule at best.
Of course, it did not happen as planned.
We both were running snow this morning, so we did not go bowling.
We did go to the Commissary and had a leisurely shopping trip.
We came home, put away the groceries, and took both dogs for a walk.
We were walking around the Azalea Trace campus with the dogs enjoying their sniffing and marking duties.
About two-thirds around the campus, with Marcel and me walking behind Linda and Cherie, Linda suddenly fell, face forward, onto the paved road.
I saw her fall.
It looked as if her right leg gave way and she fell forward like a tree falling.
I rushed to her side and she was already sitting up.
He glasses were broken, her right eye was already swelling!
She got to her feet with my help, and cheeked herself over.
Her head hurt and her right eye was swelling fast.
We walked back to our apartment, put the dogs in, and immediately went to the nurses office which is right next to our apartment.
The RN, named Sandy, immediately checked Linda out and strongly recommended we head to the Emergency room.
At the Emergency room, we were see quickly and within 45 minutes, Linda was in for a CT scan of her head.
The results were negative and after a complete exam from the Emergency Room Doctor, we were discharged.
AT that time, Linda felt good enough to try to get her glasses repaired since she cannot drive with out them.
We did cancel her appointment with the eye doctor while we were in the ER since we were both sure she would not be able to have her eyes examined with her right eye all but swollen closed.
Good decision.
Walmart quickly came up with a set of frames that fit her lenses and we went home.
She is now asleep.
Her eye is sporting a terrific shiner!
Her eye is black from her eye lid to below her eye and from her nose to the far side of her eye.
You will notice I said BLACK, not Black and Blue.
She is also stiff and sore from the jolt of falling and has a skinned knee.
My concern is;  What caused that fall.
She has fallen before in the past,  and she has almost fallen recently.
But what is causing this?
The other issues is, me.
Technically, my neurologist permits me to drive with someone in the car.
I chose not to drive a while ago.
But, I retained my drivers license, legally, for emergencies just like today.
And with her glasses repaired, she will probably return to the driver's seat.
But, if these falling issues persist, our mobility will be seriously curtailed.
Because, while I drive well, my issues preclude me from returning to the driver's seat full time.
We will see what happens next.
But this is another example of how LBD effects both the sufferer and the care giver.
I will keep you informed.

In Church today, as I was getting ready to act as a server for Communion, I was praying to get my thoughts in line with Communion.
Suddenly, it came to me, that I had been using my disease as a crutch in life!
More over, I had not gone to the Lord and asked for HIS guidance, and if possible HIS healing!!
In fact, I had asked the Lord NOT to heal me.
These were disturbing and sobering thoughts.
But true!!
So, right there, right then, privately, with God listening, I asked God to lead me through my journey with LBD and to heal me, if it were his perfect plan.
I also confessed my sins and shortcomings in how I dealt with LBD.
I asked the Holy Spirit to guide me and keep me from using my disease as a crutch or excuse.
This is a change that I did not see coming.
But I welcome it and fully embrace it.
Will it change my prognosis?
It certainly could!
Will it change how I deal with Lewy Body Dementia?
Absolutely!!
I confess that I have been trying to navigate this journey on my own.
God let me know that today in those quiet moments in front of our fellowship.
I will now ignore that gentle nudge.
God does speak to us, if we listen.
I did.
Praise God, from who all blessing fall!

Lewy Body Dementia is an ever changing disease.
But, you already know that!
My hallucinations have taken an interesting turn recently.
I see one thing, and then it changes in state the next time I look at it.
For instance, this morning I looked that the dogs breakfast dishes and told my wife, both of them had eaten breakfast.
Then, just a moment later, the plates were full and untouched!
Not, I would have sworn their plates were cleaned!
But, at second glance, they were not.
I have also had this happen recently on different occasions.
I will admit it is a bit upsetting!
And, I don't have Marcel the Wonder Dog to act as my check point since his plate is not something he would bark at if it were empty or full.
This is a new issue and one I will keep an eye on.
No pun intended.
And yes, I did tell my wife.
I tell her everything!
Second, my autonomic functions no longer give me that early warning for a need to go to the bathroom!
Either one!!
So, I go from having no urge or inkling that I have to go, to an all out emergency rune to the bathroom!!
It is quite disconcerting as you can imagine.
I suppose, adult incontinence underwear are soon to become a necessity!
But, that Depends on how this develops.
(Pun intended) More later, I have to go.

<doc date=Sunday, January 25, 2015>
I notice in the evening, I get this overwhelming, almost uncontrollable, need to scream.
It is not a desire, it is a NEED  !!
I do not know where it comes from or what the NEED comes from.
I just know it is new and frustrating.
I was posting on the LBDA.org social group and I lost my train of thought.
I began to meander.
I did not delete what I wrote, but left it alone.
Again, this is a new issue.
Up to now, I have been able to write my thoughts fairly accurately.
This event also caused me frustration.
I realize I am moving into uncharted territory for me.
And, since the availability of first hand information about the LBD journey is all but nonexistent, I am going through this alone.
However, at least I am providing what I can for others who will follow.
Again, the emotional journey is much worse than the physical one. 
</doc>
<doc date=Thursday, January 15, 2015>
As I wrote my last post, I got to thinking how I could do so well with a diagnosis of Lewy Body Dementia.
Many people, including our dinner partner this evening, comment that I do not show signs of LBD.
Of course, they have no basis of my past capabilities to make that judgement.
But, it came to me tonight, that how a person does with a disease, is totally dependent on how they handle the diagnosis!
My neighbor across the hall is not doing well.
He had a degenerative muscle disease that has required him to be surgically catheterized.
He is not happy with the procedure and how it effects his quality of life.
So, his unhappiness translates into how he lives.
He is miserable because he is not capable of the things he once was.
And that mental battle keeps him upset, unable to sleep, and miserable!
I know people that have very destructive diseases, that look bright, happy, and for all perceptions, unaffected by the disease that is ravaging their bodies.
They look at life as a challenge and choose to find the positives i their life, regardless of their medical condition.
I choose to look at my life in the same way.
I used to have a near photographic memory.
I could remember the electronic, hydraulic, and mechanical, schematics of the MK 42 gun mount.
I could use that memory to trouble shoot this extremely complicated weapons system.
Now, I cannot remember most things.
In case you did not read a previous post, I have actually woke my wife up in the middle of the night to ask her name!
True!!
So, I choose to enjoy life on the level I am at today.
Yes, I no longer drive.
Yes, I have lost much of my muscle mass.
Yes, my cognitive skills are waining, but, I still can serve God through a ministry He gave me.
Yes, I can still enjoy some of my old hobbies.
But, I also have great conversations with new friends.
Do I remember who they were 10 minutes after I met them?
No!
Who cares, they wear name tags here!!
I can still read.
So, I  credit my slow progression, even though it has progressed lately, to my positive attitude towards my disease.
And that applies to my wife also.
She does not let me divorce myself from the things of life.
I believe this will keep me mentally active longer than someone who gives in.
Yes, I have relaxed my fight.
I do not pretend to be normal anymore.
But, I am still engaged and as active as I can be.
So, if you had LBD, perk up!!
Look at the things that happen to you as a new challenge and something interesting to live through.
Not the end of you life as you knew it!
Because if you do look at you disease as the "End of your life as you knew it",  it will be!

Linda and I have both noticed a drop off in my mental function since the move.
We both knew the was a possibility.
She hopes it will mitigate itself as I acclimate to the community.
I am not as hopeful based on past experience.
I have never rebounded from these drop offs.
The last few days, I have actually felt "drunk"!
Things look farther away, when we drive, things seem to fly at me, and I am unsteady on my feet.
When I got up from my nap today, I was dizzy.
This, coupled with my recent breathing issues leads me to believe I may be on a new, lower, level.
No big deal.
I know LBD progresses and I have no fantasy that mine will stop progressing.
So, I can either accept the progression of get stressed out and more depressed.
One of the issues of the move is there are so many nice, friendly, people living here and I cannot remember their names!
It is frustrating.
Many of the residents wear name tags, and that helps.
I try to wear mine most of the time so the residents know who I am.
Most of the residents do not know I have LBD.
I guess I a reticent to introduce myself with; "Hi, I'm Don and I have LBD!"
It sounds like I am in AA.
So, we will continue to deal, or struggle, with the "new normal".
One thing that would help me is;  If friends and family would be honest and stop trying to put a sugar coat on how they see me.
They MUST see the change in me.
So, why not just say, I see you have had a mental change.
How are you dealing with that?
I realize I deal with my disease different than others.
But, I prefer open, honest discussion, verses stilted deception and misrepresentation.
But, I know some folks feel awkward with discussions about my disease.
Again, as I have said before, the purpose of this blog is to openly discuss how I deal with LBD.
So, now you know where I am on this change.
More later.

I was sitting here, in my power recliner, thinking of the past.
An event came to mind that caused me to laugh and also think.
It was a long time before i was diagnosed with LBD.
We lived in the Tidewater of Virginia and we were looking at property in North Carolina.
I was on the telephone wit the realtor setting up our appointment and she was giving us directions to the property.
She asked my how we were coming?
My reply was;  In a white Bronco!
I still laugh at that one.
Obviously she was asking which route we we re driving south on.
But, that did not enter my mind when she asked the question.
And we were driving down in  our full size, white, 1984 Bronco.
Made sense to me.
Now, I answer questions wrong often.
Sometime I misunderstand the question, do not hear it clearly, or I am just confused.
But that reply still take the cake!
Sometimes it is not dementia.
Or, was it?

<doc date=Sunday, January 4, 2015>
Today in Church, I noticed a couple of times that I ran out of breathy and had to mental tell myself to breath.
I was not doing anything physically stressful.
Just sitting or standing in Church.
Yet, it was like I forgot to breath.
Strange feeling.
So, like so many things those of us with LBD deal with, I will watch this and see if it is related to those Lewy Bodies short circuiting another involuntary function, or not.
I also have a Neurologist appoint coming up in the near future.
I will see if I can get an answer out of that clown.
Honestly, sometimes I feel that after the diagnosis, the doctors are just waiting to see how much can go wrong with me before I die!
Back to the breathing.
I will have to do some research on this issue.
More later.

<doc date=Saturday, January 3, 2015>
I know we are settled in Azalea Trace, our retirement community.
Why?
Yesterday we went to the pool!
It was wonderfully warm and relaxing.
And the hot tub was hot and relaxing.
This is living!
But Linda has our apartment completely done.
The sofa and entertainment unit came yesterday.
They fit beautifully.
Our living room is cozy and welcoming and I am comfortable.
Monday, the sale of our house closes.
So, that will be done and I believe I will be even more relaxed after that milestone is complete.
Home ownership is a wonderful thing.
But, the responsibility is more than I can deal with at this point in my life.
Out first year here, the termites attacked our home and I have never mentally recovered from that.
Termites crawling out of the walls, through holes they made, was traumatic!!
I saw our investment being devoured by insects.
Then, there is the risk of hurricanes in Florida.
God blessed us on that one.
So, I will not miss home ownership at all.
Now, everything is taken care of.
Even our facility is certified as a "Shelter in Place" community by FEMA.
It should be, it is concrete and steel construction.
Even the windows are Cat 4 certified.
I can finally relax.
We have a neighbor, across the hall.
Her husband is very ill and not very cooperative.
She is dealing with the possibility of placing him in Skilled Care.
But, the one issue she does not have is the cost of his care.
That is the security a Continuing Care Retirement Community provides.
Now, don't get the idea I am not dealing with LBD issues.
The hallucinations have increased again.
I woke p the other night, to go to the bathroom, and after I laid back down, I saw a man, standing nest to our bed, on my side.
He finally went away and I went back to sleep.
Remember my hallucination rule;  If the dogs don't bark, it ain't there!
Dogs are good!
So, we are settled and beginning to enjoy the amenities and benefits of our new community.
We are getting more and more comfortable.
I am glad we made this choice.
Or better, I am glad God provided this for us.

While I have experienced some issues, discussed in other blogs, related too or caused by the move, Marcel the Wonder Dog, my long time companion has had some rather disturbing developments that surfaced last night.
He has had seizures before, that we first thought were mini strokes.
The Vet determined he had low thyroid and prescribed the same medication I take for the same condition,  His is a larger dose than mine!
But yesterday, he had at least two seizure episodes that frightened both of us.
Since we had been through this before, I held hm and talked to him while he was shaking and was partially paralyzed.
In about ten minutes, the seizure stopped and he acted like nothing happened.
I looked this up on Pet Med MD and got the same information.
I plan on taking hi to the Vet next week, or sooner, if he gets worse.
While Marcel is 11, and miniature poodles can live to 20, I understand he is getting older and has issues.
I also understand that I may loose him.
That would be tough for Linda and me, but, we have lost loved pets before.
It is tough!
It hurts.
But, we recovered, after a while.
Just the same, Marcel's last seizures started just after we moved to Florida.
So, the recent seizures probably can be traced to the stress of moving once again.
Not his is familiar to him.
I understand that.
Linda did EVERYTHING she could to acclimate me to our new lay out.
She walked me around the apartment and showed me where everything was, twice!!
I still can't find some things, but I know where the important things are, like my pills and my coffee cup!!
Today, Marcel seems to be his old, prancing, perky, self!!
I am glad.
He keeps me happy and on an even keel.
I love that dog!

<doc date=Sunday, December 28, 2014>
Much of my writings have been from the prospective of me teaching about LBD.
I figured that out as my wife was driving us home from the Commissary.
I often review my life in those quiet moments.
So, I decided to try to reflect on my emotions and perspective on how LBD impacts me.
personally.
As I look back, this journey started with memory loss and some rigidity on,y left side.
I ignored it for a while and then told my wife and then my GP in Virginia.
He really keyed on the symptoms and sent me to a great neurologist.
At that point, I thought that nothing would be found.
But as the testing went on and became more intrusive, I started to wonder what the outcome would be.
Then, the neurologist sent me to The University of Virginia for a second opinion.
That really caused me to pause.
That testing and my neurologist's testing agreed and she told me she was convinced I have Lewy Body Dementia.
Linda and I were surprised and somewhat shocked.
My neurologist, who was an expert on this disease immediately prescribed Arecept and Namenda.
I now take Razadyne in place of Arecept, but they are the same thing.
Studied have proven taking these drugs early in the LBD journey help to defer the progression of the disease.
Now, four years down the road, I have seen many changes.
My reaction to the disease remains mostly the same.
I see what is happening to me as "interesting"!
I realize that seems weird, but it is how I view things.
here have been issues that depress me.
For instance, not driving, loosing my independence, and even the fact that I had to retire because I could no longer do my job effectively without extraordinary assistance.
Actually, I would have needed someone to do my job while I napped!
But then, at this point, who would drive me to work and tae me home?
The hallucinations did not bother me in the beginning.
The were small animals that I knew were not real.
But, seeing a man, in color, real as any man, walk across a busy interstate in front of me, as I drove shook me.
If I were closer to him I would have stopped or swerved to avoid hitting him and that would have caused an accident!
You can see why  don't drive anymore.
I have written before about my depression over my loss of independence and friends.
Yes, I have friends, but they all olive in Virginia!
And I am in Florida.
That will not change.
That God for email and telephones.
This disease causes other issues besides memory failure and hallucinations.
For instance, I spend much of my days in another place and time.
I have day time dreams, while I am awake, that I am in the Navy, stationed on a ship, doing what I used to do.
That time continues to be comfortable to me.
I am depressed.
Some of it is chemical imbalance in my brain and some pf the depression is over my loss of independence, and isolation.
I also find conversations with new people difficult.
I cannot discuss things not related to my Navy experience since my mind lives in those times.
I am always asking people I meet here at Azalea Trace if they are Navy, where they were stationed and what the do.
This is difficult for others to deal with.
Then there are the "out of character" comments and gestures.
These started before my diagnosis.
For instance, at a Church business meeting, I would take the agenda paper and make a hat out of it and wear that hat!
My wife would "yell" at me.
She did not understand and neither did I.
Looking back, we both understand now.
There were other unscripted foibles too.
But they slip my mind right now.
I have said before that I am now in the second half of this disease and I am glad we live in this community.
I am not free to experience this disease without defense.
Before, I had to "pretend" to be normal all the time!
Why, because I knew most CCRC communities would not accept me unless I was a "Full Up Round"!
Now, when I do not feel mentally whole, it is OK.
I can be where I am without issues.
Then there is the physical side of LBD.
Again, I have written about the portion of the brain that controls the autonomic functions.
I suffer from constipation, urinary control issues, aspirating and choking, busy hands and now, more stability issues when I walk or stand and turn.
I have also lost much of my strength.
My legs have atrophied as have my arms.
I cannot life or carry heavy things anymore.
As I say; It is what it is.
All of these are aggravating at best.
They cause interruptions in my life but they have not, "YET" cause me a big issue.
They will!
I will fall and need medical attention sooner or later.
I live in the perfect place to meet those needs.
So, how am I dealing with Lewy Body Dementia?
I think I am doing well.
I am still mentally connected enough to discuss these issues most of the time.
Yes, there are times I cannot find the words to describe my emotions or feelings.
Yes, I am disconnected from the world around me.
Yes, I depend on my wife for more and more.
But, God is still giving me the ability to serve him with a Bible Study and I am hoping to find other Ministries here at Azalea Trace.
I refuse to give in to LBD.
Yes, the disease is winning.
Yes, I am willing to let LBD progress now that I live in a CCRC.
But, I will still use the abilities God reserves for Him for His glory.
That is what keeps me going!
I am still not angry about the disease.
I am not angry because elf the effects of LBD.
I am not even angry about not driving or loosing my independence.
Depressed over these things?
Yes.
Angry?
No.
What does the future hold?
I guess we will have to wait and see.
I hope you will stay with me as we take this journey together.

We have been here at Azalea Trace in Pensacola for just over two weeks.
We are unpacked, pictures up, and settled.
We took two long walks today and even found the second pond on this 122 acre campus.
It is big enough to have a fishing pier.
But, there are signs everywhere warning you to "Beware of Snakes!"
Well, this is Florida.
Even the two miniature poodles love it here.
We got up this morning and decided to eat breakfast in the dining room.
Naturally, the meal and the fellowship were wonderful.
Then, today was our first house keeping day.
Our apartment was expertly cleaned by a very friendly, caring person.
We could not ask for anything better.
To say we are happy here would be an understatement.
The questions I have are; why didn't we do earlier?
And why doesn't everyone do this?
Now both questions are without answers.
We moved here as soon as God had it planned for us to move here.
And, this life style is not for everyone.
I understand that.
But, boy am I happy here.
Today is warm enough to be shirt sleeve weather!
Walking was a pleasure, and I even hit about a dozen balls at the driving range!
Again, that is part of our community also!
The furniture store that we purchased our couch and entertainment center from called and told us our furniture would be delivered 2 January!!
That is three weeks early!
Another pleasant surprise.
All in all, everything is going great and we are really beginning to feel at home her at Azalea Trace.
While I have noticed some stability and memory issues, I am more relaxed than I have been in a long time.
This was the best decision for us.
More later.

<doc date=Monday, December 22, 2014>
Today, we went to our house that we sold and cleaned the entire house in preparation for the closing.
We had some things left to bring over to Azalea and we loaded them into the car, along with the cleaning supplies, vacuum cleaner, and two miniature poodles.
After all, I could not leave them home alone for several hours, could I?
When we got back to Azalea, we unloaded the things to go in the apartment, and then I drove the car to the basement entrance to unload the things to go in storage and to the Azalea Store for sale.
It took several loads and some creative packing in our storage cage, but I succeeded.
Then, i took the shopping cart back that I used to move the stuff.
Took the steps to the first floor and got our mail, and walked down the hallway to our apartment.
Everything was good until I remembered the car.
Where did I leave the car?!
It was at the loading dock near the basement entrance.
Not a goo place for long term parking.
So, I had to go get the car, move it to our parking lot, and then go into our apartment.
Oh yes, I had to admit to my wife I lost the car, for a few minutes.
I was doing so well, and I enjoyed driving the car the 200 feet or so.
As you know, I no longer drive on the road, but in the parking lot or on the road in Azalea Trace's compound, I will, on occasion, drive those few feet.
Loosing the car is humorous but it is also a reflection of where I am.
I do things in order.
My mind organizes what I am supposed to do in steps.
As long as someone does not interrupt my steps with other things to do or social conversation I can accomplish that task, most of the time.
While I was unloading the car and moving things to our storage cage, I met and talked with a few residents.
But, I always got back on task, I thought.
When all the steps in my task were complete, I returned home.
What were the last steps?
Get the mail and return home.
OOPS!
I forgot, park the car.
Again, there is some very valuable insight into the workings of the mind of a person with dementia here!
Do not let this wisdom slip from your fingers.
You will be better equipped to understand your LBD patient if you understand my dilemma of today.
Where am I now, in my power recliner, watching Monday Night Football.
But, I bet I fall asleep before half time!

Lewy Body Dementia is a little know disease that second only to Alzheimer's for frequency in the dementia world.
But, as more is being learned, the connection between Lewy Bodies and all other dementia's and Parkinson's is being drawn.
That being said, it took the death of Robin Williams to bring the mention of Lewy Body Dementia to the forefront.
Not even the death of the perennial Top 40 Disc Jockey, Cassey Kasum brought Lewy Body Dementia any notoriety.
All of us with Lewy Body Dementia (LBD) suffer from depression, anxiety, fear, and anger, caused b the unknown of our disease.
Some of us, like Robin Williams, cannot deal with those issues and choose to commit suicide.
Other, for reasons I will not speculate on, can stand our ground and make the best of a bad situation.
Many times, various doctors that I visit ask me if I am suicidal or homicidal.
I always answer no to the first and no, I like women, to the second!
You have to see the humor in that!
But, that does not mean I am immune to the stress of LBD.
For instance, I feel like a prisoner because I have no independence!
I cannot drive.
I have no bank account, no credit card I can use without my wife seeing what I am doing, and no time alone.
I cannot even manage my own medicines!
I am not complaining.
I am merely stating the facts.
Heck, I need my wife to take me to get a haircut.
I have not been that dependent on another person since I was 16 year old.
Besides all the horrors of LBD, i.e.
Hallucinations, lost memory, stability issues, wet pants, getting lost, repeating the same story, drooling, aspiration, sexual dysfunction, constipation, depression, anxiety, and other issues I forget, the loss of my manhood, my virility and vitality, and ,my independence is the most frustrating and embarrassing issues of this disease.
I am not the man I used to be as my wife often tells me.
I have lost most of my body strength.
My arms and legs have atrophied and the skin hangs on y arms and chest.
Lewy Body is robbing me, day by day, of who I was.
And who I am becoming, I do not like!
I suspect Robin Williams saw who he would become and did not like the prospect.
Again, just my uninformed opinion.
As I have said, the most frustration, emasculating, impact of LBD is that it has reduced me to a dependent, prisoner, of my keepers.
My wife could give me any pills and I would take them.
She is in charge of me.
I do not determine where we go what we do, or who we do it with.
Now, my wife tries very hard to include me in decisions.
But, that is more for my emotional well being than any need for my input.
And, if I disagree with her decision, direction or plans, I am quietly over ruled or ignored.
To be fair, when I was in charge, I did things much the same way.
I know; "What goes around comes around!"
I guess I never thought I would be dependent!
Heck, I always thought I would die on active duty!
But now I am dependent on the kindness of my wife.
Lucky she is a wonderful, loving, caring, wife!
But, all that niceness cannot erase the sting of my loss of manhood and independence.
She knows that, and continues to be gentle with me.
So, what is it like to have LBD?
Terrible.
But, it is the place I am now and I need to be happy where I am.
And as tough as that is, I am trying to be happy.
That is all I can do.
Try!

We have been residents of Azalea Trace for 10 days.
We are beginning to settle down and set our new routine.
The apartment is looking like an organized home and we are both sleeping well.
We have met a number of interesting people and we enjoy dinners in the dinning room.
We normal eat every night with different people.
I find I look forward to different dinner conversations.
It is energizing to discuss issues with people of differing opinions and experiences.
And dinner itself is gourmet quality.
Tonight I had bourbon honey glazed pork tenderloin!!
It was tender, tasty, and wonderful.
My diet is definitely suffering here!
We eat our breakfast and lunch at our dining room table!
A habit we stopped for a long time.
Yet, in this apartment eating at the table is comfortable and convenient.
So, another positive change in our lives.
We have not been in the pool or the gym yet.
We did look at the Chapel today.
It is very nice.
I need to find the billiards room and the card room.
I her some folks play pinochle.
Even the dogs are settling down.
But, we still crate them when we go out for more than a meal.
But, they are barking less and enjoying our many walks.
Tomorrow, our son and his family are coming for dinner.
They have not had the pleasure of our dining room yet.
And, tomorrow night, one of the  three entrees is Prime Rib!!
Monday, we will Finnish with the house and make it ready for the closing.
How am I doing?
Remarkably well.
I have had some hallucinations and I have noticed more distant, spacey, mental feelings.
I spent a good part of this morning trying to remember the job I was going to finish.
It was about noon that I finally realized I was dreaming of the job and did not have anything pressing to do.
Also, walking the dogs in the dark is unnerving for me.
I am more unstable when I walk, so the dark makes that even worse.
It is just a matter of time before I fall.
Good thing the grass is soft.
But, I feel more relaxed as I have written earlier.
This feels like a secure, home to me and that is good.
I am adjusting well.
I believe the real test will be after the Holidays when my wife is gone on Tuesday and Wednesday mornings.
How I react to they, will be the telling thing.
One more point.
We made the choice to move to a Continuing Care Retirement Community.
I knew this was the answer for the issues that will most likely impact us.
So, there was no push back from me.
My wife was not sold on the idea until we found Azalea Trace.
This community made her feel at home.
We met a woman moving is and her daughter the other day.
The Mom was not all that happy about moving in.
He daughter was obviously the one pushing the Mom into the move.
I believe, the Mom will be happy, but I see a period of anger and adjustment for her.
It is better if the people moving into the CCRC actually WANT to move there.
Waiting to find a community when the parent is unable to make the decision on their own is never going to be good.
Look early and often.
Do your research and find a place that works for the person living there.
Then move in as soon as possible!!
Everyone involved will be better off.
Trust me.

Tonight, I had a few pictures and a key holder to put up.
No big issue, even now.
Then, there was the change of address issues!
That is a never ending terror!
I tackled the DMV online tonight.
I did this while I was being asked a thousand questions by my wife!
But, even with the antiquated website Florida has, I won!
Of course, voter registration is another issue.
I suppose, if I were an illegal alien or a terrorist, and I was registering as a Democrat, I could register by CB radio!!
But, we have to go in person or SNAIL MAIL  our change of address to them!
Wow.
This is our last move.
My last change of duty stations in this life.
My wife has informed me that we have moved 18 times in our almost 43 years of marriage.
That is clearly too many times.
But, I cannot go back and change that, even though I wish I could.
But, this is the last move just based on the cost of moving here!
But, these moving issues never bothered me before.
Maybe because my wife did them in the past.
But, she is trying to keep me involved in our life and she thought change of address issues were in my wheel house.
So, I have taken this issue on, or maybe it would be better said, the issue has taken me on!
I just do not have the mental capacity to deal with things that require patience or things that require concentration.
Especially after a busy day.
Again, these are just normal LBD issues.
But, that's what I write about! 
</doc>
<doc date=Wednesday, December 17, 2014>
The move is done!
Everything is put in place.
I am even ready to get back to our ministry at Bay Breeze Assisted Living Facility!
We are back in service!
Wow, what a week!
Now, this was a normal move for us.
My wife informed me it was our 18th move!!
I did not know that, but she did.
The real fact is, it is our last move.
How have I done?
Fairly well.
I am very relaxed here at Azalea Trace.
From my prospective, my fight to appear normal is over.
I can relax, knowing I am in a place that will care for me, or Linda, regardless of what happens.
And that reality is liberating!
Ever since Dr. Bowles told us of my diagnosis, we have lived in the shadow of "What if?!"
We looked and toured many CCRC's with many different reactions.
Some would not admit me because of my diagnosis.
Some did not meet our needs.
Some were TOO expensive.
Some were just not for us.
Then we found Azalea Trace and we both knew this was the place for us.
And, Azalea Trace, with my full disclosure, accepted me!
But, we were on the waiting list for over a year.
That was a stressful time because we saw my disease progressing.
We both knew that I would not be admitted if I took a larger downward turn.
But, in God's perfect timing, we were offered an apartment, better than we dreamed of, and moved in before the end of the year.
God is good.
So, the move was disconcerting, caused me some anxious moments, and anxiety, but I am now settled and comfortable.
So, this move IS good.
Now, we can enjoy some of the fun things, like the heated indoor pool and hot tub!!
Merry Christmas.
</doc>
<doc date=Monday, December 15, 2014>
Well, all the boxes are unpacked, the furniture is in place, the new adjustable Tempurpedic bed is here, most of the pictures are hung, and things look a lot like home!
I still can't find most things, but Linda can  I do know where emu coffee cup is and the coffee pot.
I have taken a shower, so I know how that works, much to the relief of most around me.
Another BIG issues off our plate is my large gun safe, the one that weighed 800 pound, was moved to my old neighbor's home today.
We hired the same folks that delivered it.
They were great.
So that issue is done.
We still have t clean the old house and I have some sorting to do in the garage.
That will wait a couple of days.
Tonight, we enjoyed a very good meal in the dining room.
Tilopia for my wife and New York Strip Steak for me.
Have I mentioned the food here at Azalea Trace is great?!
My wife has gone to bed early and I am up, blogging and relaxing.
I will probably watch the Monday Night Football game.
We learned tonight that our two senior citizen poodles have been making noise when we are gone.
No problem, we will crate them when we are gone from now on.
We had to do that in the Senior's Apartments in Virginia Beach before we moved to Florida.
We put them in the crate when we went to dinner tonight and they seemed OK with it.
They will have to adjust.
So will I.
Returning to our apartment after dinner, we met a lady who has early Frontal Lobe Dementia.
She is having memory issues and wants to get together to compare notes.
I plan on keeping that appointment.
I feel much less stressed here.
I do not feel like I have to be alert all the time.
I feel totally secure and I am sleeping most of the night.
My stability is worse.
As I tell Linda, the floor moves.
Somewhat like being on a Destroyer in moderately rough seas.
I did fall the other day because of this increase in my stability issues.
No big deal.
We are settling in nicely and I believe both of us are adjusting well.
It is interesting to me, how God's hand has been in this move from many years ago.
God enabled us to save for our retirement.
God gave me a career that provided me a good retirement.
My Wife worked hard, with God's help, to get her Master's Degree in Library Science and worked for 30 years as a Librarian which gave us another retirement income and more savings.
God provided us with the wisdom to sign up for the Civil Service Long Term Care insurance when we were young.
We are in Azalea Trace because God provided for us.
He exceedingly met our needs when we were our neediest!
As I have written before, all Continuing Care Retirement Communities are expensive.
Some, more than others, but that is all relative to the economy of the area the CCRC is located.
God placed us in Pensacola to see Azalea Trace and place us there, where the money HE provided will go the farthest.
God IS good!
So, as you can see, I am content and relaxed, finally.
I now do not have to fight Mr. Lewy!
I can relax and that is a blessing in itself.
More later.

<doc date=Thursday, December 11, 2014>
We are moved in!
The boxes are starting to disappear, and our apartment is beginning to look like a home.
We had a good move, under budget, yesterday.
Everything was in the apartment by 2PM.
Much of this success is because my wife did so much packing and organizing.
Of course, we did not get rid of enough stuff.
So, more kitchen equipment will need to be culled.
But, that is small stuff.
Our new bed is not here yet, neither is the couch or the entertainment center,  But, we slept in our bed and have television to watch.
The hot water heater did not work, the thermostat on a NEW unit failed.
But, no hot water was no issue because we did not have a shower curtain rod until this afternoon.
Now we have both and I am going to take a shower tonight.
Another delay was our refrigerator.
I arrived today!
So now we can move our food over tomorrow.
All little annoyances, but all in all, a good move.
I now have to walk the digs instead of opening the back door to our fenced in yard.
The walks are good for me and they seem to like them.
They are also adapting to apartment living.
The seem to accept us leaving and are keeping quiet in our absence.
Just four more boxes and we will be unpacked!
Not all put in place, but unpacked!
The closing of our home sale is 5 January.
SO, things are coming together.
I am doing fairly well.
During the pack out, I was disoriented and felt like I was drunk!
I could not concentrate on what was happening.
Our son was with me and was a great help.
I am still somewhat confused and I am more unstable when walking.
SO, the move has caused me issues, but they were expected.
My wife continues to unpack and work hard.
I try to help but I tire easy.
Still, we were up until 1AM last night unpacking.
I hope we go to bed earlier tonight!
I think this will be good, once I find my underwear!
I do have coffee and I have my coffee cup.
What more could I need.
More later.

<doc date=Saturday, December 6, 2014>
This blog is about the impact Lewy Body Dementia places on an individual patient.
More specific, how I am doing with the stress and emotions of the move.
The last couple of days my wife has been focused on packing the collectibles and personal items in out home.
Then, we sorted out the things we know will not fit into our new home.
That lead to the dreaded "Yard Sale"!
That was today!
We were up at 5AM!
But the was up most of the night organizing, sorting, and working on her Bible Study that she still has to lead on Wednesday.
She is a discussion leader for Bible Study Fellowship.
An international Bible Study started by a missionary named Wetherell Johnson.
Today, was 6 hours of "Show Time"!!!
Dealing with people that want the best things for pennies on the dollar.
But, we sold most of what we need too.
Also, my neighbors came out in force to purchase many things without even a thought of bargaining.
I actually had one neighbor give us MORE than we were asking.
I really do have some great neighbors and I will miss them.
We have also taken a couple of loads to the new place insulting hanging clothes.
We will carry more over tomorrow after Church and on Monday.
Tuesday will be busy getting ready for the big move on Wednesday.
So, how am I doing?
I am exhausted!
I am very grouchy and upset.
My poor wife has been snipped at and yell at more than a few times.
When things go wrong, or seem wrong to me, I react, without social filters!!
I cannot find anything in our house, our "Brain Center" where all the pills, electronics, and phones live, is gone!!
We have sold most of the furniture that will not fit ion the new place and taken down the art work from the walls, so the house echoes!!
My blood pressure is up, I am confused, and I do not know where many things are.
Then, there are the constant questions, taskings, and directions, that I need to react to.
Find the home warrantees, move this, build me a box.
It is all required parts of moving and I have been through it many times.
Most of our moves were self-inflicted, by me.
Even this one is my initiation.
But this one is different in that I cannot life anything because of my left shoulder, I cannot drive anywhere my self, and I cannot process more than one task at a time!
All of that stresses me!
I feel like a prisoner!
For instance, I need a haircut, desperately!!
Not on the schedule.
Yesterday, my wife needed more wrapping paper to pack with.
So, to keep her on schedule, I walked to the corner and bought some from the U-Haul store!
Walked!
Yes, it is good for me, and yes, I did not get lost.
But, I will be glad when this is over and we are settled.
Last of all, I feel frustrated and depressed.
I am mentally questioning all of my decisions.
That makes me even more frustrated and depressed.
So, you see where I am right now.
I will keep you informed.
I believe Wednesday will be a tough day, even the climax of the move.
Then, things will start to get back to normal, I hope.

<doc date=Wednesday, December 3, 2014>
Well almost!
We took custody of our apartment today.
We paid the remainder of our entrance fee, a check bigger than any one I ever saw, well enough wrote and was on the hook to make good, and we got our keys!
Of course, there are still some things to get done, like any new home.
And the apartment has not had it's final cleaning.
But all that will be taken care of.
Oh, our refrigerator is not here yet.
Again, it will arrive soon.
So, now no more free lunches!
All meals are on us.
And, now we have to follow the rules of the community.
For instance, my neighbor called me on my cell phone while we were eating lunch.
I answered the call, at our table.
My first demerit!!
They were nice about it.
But standing in the corner with a dunce hat on is my next punishment!
The next 6 days we will move small items into our new home.
Clothes, small boxes, nick knacks, and other small items.
I cannot lift anything of substance with my left arm.
I have a torn rotator cuff that I have known about for about a year.
It has become much worse and I now cannot even lift a coffee cup with my left hand.
I had put off the surgery until we were moved into Azalea Trace just in case I have a negative reaction to general anesthesia.
LBD patients have a 60% chance of having a significant mental decline after general anesthesia.
So, our caution is well founded.
If you are interested in these issues, check out the LBDA.org site.
The Lewy Body Dementia Association has numerous reports from caregivers, in the Community section, describing the cognitive downturn of their LBD patient in conjunction with general anesthesia.
Also, they have a few clinical studies supporting these reports.
We will actually move in next Wednesday.
I will keep you informed.
More later.

<doc date=Wednesday, November 26, 2014>
I have written before about our pending move to a Continuing Care Retirement Community (CCRC) in Pensacola.
We were offered and we accepted a two bedroom apartment in the Independent Living area of this CCRC.
We passed the medical and mental screening and worked with the facilities manager to make the changes and updates we wanted in the apartment.
For the last month or so, walls have been removed, bathrooms changed, flooring replaced, and ceiling fans installed.
We visited our apartment today and it is very close to being complete.
The other part of this journey was to sell our home in Florida.
That proved to be much more difficult than either of us imagined.
We were told by the media and the realtor that the market was moving and we would have no problem selling our home for what we were asking!
Boy did that opinion turn out to be wrong.
But, God had a plan and it was a good one.
Today, we signed a contract for the sale of our home, for less than we wanted, but still a fair price for us and the buyer.
God is good!!
So, now we can start to pack, move things, and get set for our move.
I expect we will move into our new apartment during the week of 8 December.
Of course, the facilities manager has not called me with that date yet, but, judging from what we saw today, it could only be earlier.
We are ready!!
This has been stressful for both of us.
I have been under a tremendous amount of tension and it has displayed itself in my mental ability.
I hope that I can now calm down and relax.
Any move is stressful for any person.
Add dementia to the mix and the tension and stress becomes almost disabling.
When we finally move in to our CCRC, I know I will have issues.
I did when we move here, and I was better then than I am now.
Where is my stuff!!
Security issues, and how does this work are all issues I will experience.
But, as long as I can find my coffee cup and the coffee pot, I will do fine!
I will keep you posted.

I received a question regarding my Wife's reaction to my realistic day dream.
Good question!
The short answer is;  "Write it in your log and tell tour Psychologist!"
The long answer is a little more complicated.
My Wife approaches my disease and it's progress in a unique way.
She mental catalogs everything that happens.
She uses those data points to track my progress and mental plan her approach to me and my disease.
She never treats me with any difference because of my disease.
She keeps me involved in the everyday decisions even if I do not make them.
Her goal is to keep me as normal as possible regardless of the progress of my disease.
However, she let her emotional "Iron Curtain" down today.
We were talking about the stress of our home not selling yet.
I expressed that I had considered backing out of the Azalea Trace move and just staying in our home.
Linda said; "Then everyone will see me age, quickly!
When I have to find a place that will take you or try to find a way to take care of you at home, when you progress further."
That was a monumental statement from her.
Because it is the First time she has ever expressed her concern about the future.
Lewy Body Dementia is truly a journey for both of us.
What happens to me impacted Linda much more.
I need to always remember that fact.
And while some may see her as a stoic, strong, woman and wife.
I see the cracks in that "Iron Curtain" and I understand how deeply hurt she really is.
I hope that answers the question one of my readers took the time to ask.
I appreciate your replays and support.
We are all in this together.

<doc date=Thursday, November 20, 2014>
Yesterday, while I was home alone, I got involved in a "Day Dream".
Everything in this dream was realistic to me.
I could see the people and the equipment in my mind, and I was there.
I was speaking our loud, not in my "Dream Voice".
I have told you before that I spend the vast majority of my day thinking about m career in the Navy.
That time is comfortable and enjoyable for me.
I was young, strong, fit, and in charge.
I knew what I was doing and even though what I did was dangerous, I had no fear.
Yesterdays "Day Dream" had me reporting to a Cruiser.
The day I got aboard, we had a Gunnery exercise and the guns failed to fire.
As I started to investigate the reason for this failure.
I discovered the Gunner's Mates were failing to do proper Pre-Fire checks.
They had not tested the firing circuits as outlined on the Pre-Fire maintenance card.
Furthermore, they did not know where the test equipment was that was required to do these checks.
I was livid.
In my "Day Dream" I was using "Sailor" talk to get their attention and I was actually walking around the house talking and gesturing.
Now, I have dreams that are about my Navy career and that are very involved.
But this time, I was fully awake and fully engaged in this "Day Dream".
It does not frighten me.
As a matter of fact, I was comfortable and happy as I went about restoring professional discipline to my new division.
I actually felt like I was back in uniform and and back in my element!
As my disease progresses,  expect more of these episodes.
Right now, I come back to "Today"after my "Day Dream".
But, I know that these episodes will get longer in length and then, one day, I will not come back to reality.
But I know, when this happens, it is a comfortable time for me.

<doc date=Monday, November 17, 2014>
Most of you know I have all but gave up driving.
I have kept my license but I choose not to drive.
My vision issues, hallucinations, and the legal ramifications of my disease have caused me to do this.
I am not happy about it because I am fundamentally a prisoner in my home.
I cannot even go get a haircut without someone taking me!
Think about that!!
When was the last time you had to ask someone to take you to get a haircut??
Then, add the fact that I live in Florida, have no friends here, and only have my wife to chauffeur me around.
So, MEN, how do you like riding with your wife?!
I am not casting dispersion on women drivers.
But, I am not a good passenger, even if another man is driving, and I am even worse when my wife is driving.
There is s dent in the floor on the passenger's side of our new Subaru where I have REPEATEDLY tried to apply the brakes!!
There is another issue.
Travel.
I hate airplanes.
The airline industry has degraded into a cheap bus company.
Their planes are flown until they refuse to fly anymore.
Most airlines are flying aircraft that are 20+ years old!!
Couple that with the fact that the aircraft are maintained by contractors that were hired by the airlines for being the LOWEST bidder!!
Not to mention the aircraft are flown by people that drink too much, carouse with men or women when they are supposed to be resting, and are held to schedules by their employers with salary cuts and bonus reductions.
Oh, you may add most pilots are ex-military pilots that either washed out of the military with bad evals and would not qualify for command or only went in the military to get they wings and required hours and then left the military to get a job as a air born bus driver.
Then, there dis the way the airlines treat passengers.
I remember she flying was luxurious.
People actually dressed up to fly.
Meals were served on dishes!
There was cabin service.
Luggage was free.
There was NO carry on baggage and only coats could be in the overhead bins.
Now, flying equates to ridding a bus in rural Mexico!
The only thing missing is chickens in the overhead bins!!
And then there is the cost of the torture of air travel!!
No I hate flying and will only do it in extreme emergencies.
But, this limits my trips because with only my wife driving, we are limited in any distance we drive.
Where I could drive until the tank was dry, stop for gas, coffee, and a Head stop, and drive until the next tank went dry, she is tired, exhausted, before the end of the first tank.
I once drove from Virginia Beach Virginia, to the Pennsylvania/New York state line on the northeast extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike in one stretch!!
My wife's bladder was in danger of bursting and I was in trouble for the entire weekend!
But, those days are gone.
So, another sad effect of LBD is the imprisonment of the sufferer!
And trust me I AM imprisoned.
I dearly miss my friends in Virginia!
My life is devoid of male companionship and friendship.
But, there is little any of us can do about that.
It is, the way it is.
Or, as Betsy Walsh, from NAVSES Philly says; "It is what it is!"
So, I ask the question once more; How do you like riding with your wife?
I thought so!

We found out yesterday and FOX News reported on air today that Robin Williams had Lewy Body Dementia.
Now, everyone will assume that he committed suicide because of this disease.
They will speculate that his hallucinations were tool real, too frightening for him.
Or, the prospect of the diseases ravages were too much for him to live with.
Both or none of that speculation may be true.
Only he knows for sure.
But the god thing that may come from his death is that Lewy Body Dementia may now get some attention and those of us who choose to LIVE with this disease may actually get some attention.
I have read on the LBDA.org web page from others with LBD that they are sick of being told they are not sick or they don't look sick!
LBD is a fatal, neuro-degenerative disease with no know cure.
We are not sick, we are dying!
The Lewy Body tangles will effect every part of our brains until our involuntary functions stop and we die of septicemia.
Of course, the most prevalent cause of death in LBD patents is aspiration.
But the end have been given a death sentence as sure as Stage Four Cancer of the pancreas!
It is time those in the day to day practice of medicine and the general public recognize that.
Mr. Williams chose to take his own life.
That is tragic for his family and for the LBD community.
But maybe his death will give Lewy Body Dementia the recognition that will drive the medical field to actually recognize our disease and then they will try to help us.
It took Lou Gehrig to publicize ALS.
He put a face on that terrible disease.
Maybe the death of Mr. Williams will do the same for Lewy Body Dementia.

I have read numerous posts on the LBDA.org blog about their difficulty finding a Neurologist that actually understands Lewy Body Dementia, well enough treat the individual with LBD.
I have had my own issues with neurologists.
Today, I did a search for the Gulf Coast and found few neurologists that state that they deal with dementia patients, well enough LBD.
The fact is, many neurologists try to tell us we have something other than LBD.
Strokes, Parkinson's, Depression, or other diseases, are the favorite diagnosis.
Then when we aren ourselves with knowledge, the doctors get angry and tell us to go away.
Lewy Body Dementia is either the second or third most diagnosed dementia.
And, recent medical discoveries are connecting Lewy Bodies to Parkinson's and Alzheimer's!
If that bears out, LBD is the MAIN case of all dementia's and movement disorders!!
It is a shame, be we in the LBD community must be pro-active.
We must do research on this disease and keep a log of the symptoms our loved ones are experiencing.
What we do may help medical science and it will certainly help our loved ones.
I also read a study that stated that individuals with autonomic function failures have a high risk of early death.
The fluctuations in Blood Pressure, constipation, dizziness, all are functions that are negatively impacted by the Lewy Bodies impacting the Autonomic functions of the brain.
I wonder him many neurologists have read that study.
I intend to take a copy to my neurologist to educate him!
Keep reading the LBDA web site.
Keep looking for new studies.
Knowledge is our best weapon against Lewy Body Dementia.

I slept in this morning and woke up to a call from one of my Navy Buddies.
After an 80 minute telephone call, I got up and made plans to apply a new paint sealant to our 2015 Subaru Outback.
After brunch, I tackled the car.
The sealant and tire dressing went flawlessly!
After two hours, the job was complete and the care looks great.
However, all the physical activity, the up and down action required to wax a car, apply dressing to the tires, and buffing left me suffering from dizziness and a feeling of looking at things from a distance!
These feelings have continued into the evening.
I assume that it is caused by the LBD impact on my autonomic functions.
That is my guess!
If it gets worse, I may seek medical advice.
But, I think it is just the new normal.
I have written about this issue before and it is just getting worse.
I suppose I should watch what I do.
But, I enjoy waxing the car and keeping it looking nice.
It is one of the few things I still enjoy doing.
So, I will keep on taking care of the car until I fall down doing it!
Still, dizziness and seeing thing as if they are far away is an issue I need to deal with.
So, I thought I would report it to you.
Remember, LBD is a journey that changes everyday.
This was today's report of my journey.

Thank You!!
When we started this blog, with the encouragement from my neurologist and my wife's technical ability, we never thought so many of you would enjoy and benefit from my open discussion of Lewy Body Dementia.
No accolade or award is as sweet as the honest  comments from your peer group.
I deeply appreciate your comments, prayers, and readership.
I have said this before, you are my support group, my treatment team, my LBD family and I appreciate each one of you.
As I have said before, I will continue to write as long as I can.
And, I am sure you recognize that my journey is speeding up and gaining intensity.
No big deal!
I am still here.
Maybe a little more grouchy, fuzzy, unstable, or disoriented, but still here.
And, as long as spell check works, you will be able to figure out what I am typing for a while!
Again, I thank each one of you for being there for me!

Do you remember the time when you could tell your wife or husband; "While you are doing what you are doing, do this other thing."?
I guess in the computer age they call that multi tasking.
Well, I can no longer do two or more things at once.
And, if my wife tells me to do something when I an already dong something else, I drop the first task and do the second task!
You can see where that could lead to a catastrophe!
Like, when I am cooking!
I have informed her of this problem, but she still insists on tasking me when I am already engaged in something.
I guess old habits are hard to break.
I can't even follow a recipe anymore.
I only cook things I have in my memory.
Like, I can cook eggs.
I can cook a steak.
I can cook chicken.
Don't expect me to follow the recipe on the Campbell's soup label for a new chicken dish!
I will be totally confused by the second ingredient.
I am passion this along because many of you have lived with your spouse for 30, 40, 50 years.
Most of that time, he or she has been mentally alert and able to do many things, at once.
But now, tasking us with more than one thing at a time is overwhelming and can lead to anger, frustration, outbursts, and even crying!
We are not who we were and we cannot do what we used to do.
Save both of us the frustration and give us one task at a time!
We will both be better for it.

It is called "Show Time" in the LBD community when we put on the show of being OK or normal when company is around.
But, does your LBD patient pretend to be OK when the caregiver is around or at a doctor's visit?
I used to!
It was how I was raised up in the Navy.
As a leader, we were supposed to emphasize the positive!
So, for decades, she someone asked me how I was doing or how things were going, I always said; "Outstanding"!
I would go to a doctor's visit and tell them I was doing good or that I was dealing well with the disease.
I actually had a neurologist in Virginia tell me I was a liar!!
She said I had not yet dealt with my disease!
She was right.
Now, more and more, I am trying to be honest when someone asks me how I am doing.
But, that requires me to be retrained.
Honesty is required on my part for others to understand where I am.
So, if I want them to understand where I am, I have to tell them, honestly.
So, I challenge you to challenge your LBD patient to tell you exactly how they feel and what is happening in their view!
This will clear boundaries between the caregiver and the LBD patient.
No longer will there be a chasm between the caregiver and the patient.
Both of you will understand.
But this will not happen if the caregiver does not insist that the LBD patient be painfully honest!
Yes, there are embarrassing topics that require discussion.
But honesty will pave the road to understanding.

I have noticed, lately, that I am having difficulties speaking.
I cannot find the correct words, I studded, and mumble, trying to get a thought out.
Now, for those of you who know me, this must come as a complete surprise!
Most of the time, you probably wish I would shut up!
It is not related to being tired or even stressed.
This problem is not always with me either.
It seems to be intermittent.
But, when it happens, I am frustrated.
It seems as if my mind cannot fine the word I want to say.
Then, my mouth, lips, and tongue refuse to work together to make the word come out!
I realize this is a classic symptom of LBD, but I promised to report any and all issues related to my journey with LBD, and this is a problem.
Related to this, is my mind jumbles letters together, or drops them out of words that I am reading.
The result is, I see and read a different word or a word that does not make sense.
You can imaging what an issue this is when I am Preaching!
But, even singing in Church can be an issue.
I simply lose the ability to read.
Not all the time, just intermittently, like my speech issues.
Again, I cannot tie it to anything like being tired or stressed.
It seems those Lewy Body Protein Tangles have found another place in my brain to clog up!
Maybe I should have changed my filter regularly.
You know, the old oil filter commercial; "You can pay me now, or you can pay me latter!"

You may know that one of my lifelines is a Seniors Ministry I have at a local Assisted Living Facility (ALF).
These people are sweet, salt of the earth, lonely people.
The are forgotten for the most part.
If their families visit at all, it is once a month or even less.
The visits are short, the conversations are stilted, and those who visit are glad to get our of the ALF as soon as they can.
It is as if they think they will catch whatever their relative has!
When the opportunity came to us for this Ministry, I was happy and frightened at the same time.
When I was younger, we had m\Linda's Father in a Nursing Home because his Alzheimer's had become combative.
It was difficult to visit him, especially in his last year or so, because he did not recognize us.
On the other hand, if I went out of the room to check with the nursing staff, when I came back in, I was a new visitor!
It made him happy, so who was I to argue.
Now that I am older, and dealing with LBD myself, I identify with those who I minister too.
They are very attentive during our weekly studies and they ask good questions.
After our study, they love to discuss the news of the day or any other topic!
They are lonely for outside contact and Linda and I provide a small dose of that needed medicine.
We have been blessed to conduct two Baptisms for this group.
The most recent was last Wednesday.
The gentleman I Baptized has advanced MS.
So he is very rigid and has difficulty moving.
Yet, he climbed the 20 steps to the Baptismal on his own.
His second issue is that he is afraid of water.
So, stepping into the Baptismal waters, which were about 3 feet deep, was a monumental act of courage for him.
But, he did all he needed to and we Baptised him!
Praise the Lord!!
When he came out of the water, the smile on his face lit up Heaven!!!
Now, think of this.
The Activities Director of the ALF loaded up 11 moderate to severely handicapped individuals over the age of 70, onto a bus, delivered them to First Baptist Church of Gulf Breeze, Florida, and unloaded them into the Sanctuary for a Church Service!
The Pastor at First Baptist is 40 and has little idea how to minster to Seniors, especially those that are handicapped either physically or mentally.
He has approached me about starting a Seniors Ministry at First Baptist and I agreed.
Why?
There are many more individuals in ALF's all over Gulf Breeze that need and hunger for spiritual ministry!
They are not monetarily wealthy people but they are wealthy in experiences and love.
And every once in a while, there is one person, ready to accept emus Christ as their Lord and Savior.
They only need an Ambassador of God to help them close the deal.
Working for God with these precious people keeps me wanting to keep going!
I love them and they give me back more love and friendship than I could ever hope for.
Why don't YOU stop by an ALF close ego your home and open up a relationship with just one of the forgotten people.
I guarantee you will receive blessing that far exceed anything you invest!

My wife noticed I have difficulty controlling my hands when I am sitting.
She noticed this today at our son's home.
I am constantly ringing my hands, rubbing my arms, rubbing my pants, or other hand activities.
She recommend we get an activity blanket.
The idea actually excites me since I am always doing something with my hands.
I am either picking my fingers, or rubbing my hands, my arms, or using the computer to search endless subjects my mind comes up with.
So, maybe a blanket with different textures and maybe some mechanical activities might help me control this busy hand issue.
This is an admission on my part that my LBD is progressing and I am OK with that.
In fact, I am more and more giving up fighting this disease.
I actually feel better relaxing and not fighting this disease.
For instance, I do not drive anymore.
Yes, I still have my driver's license and I could still drive.
But, why should I?
Driving is difficult and stressful for me now.
Then there is the liability issue if I were involved in an auto accident as the driver.
So, why stress?
On the same point, if an activity blanket, or as it is sometimes called a fidget or busy hand blanket, helps me deal with my hands always searching for something to touch, then I want one!!
This is truly an interesting change in my mental approach.

When I was a little boy, and even into my teenage ears, my birth Mother, Betty Kampf, always used to hold me up in a negative way, against Henry Barry, the son of her friend and hair dresser, Cammile Barry.
I ALWAYS fell short of the excellent example that Henry set!
Right!
He turned out to be a draft dodger, he went to Canada to avoid service to my country.
Notice I said; "My Country".
Henry deserted My Country so it is no longer his, even though President Ford gave the Viet Nam draft doggers, this chickens and cowards, amnesty.
Henry grew up in the two parent home.
Yes, his parents did not sleep together and his mother had boy friends, but, he did not know that then.
He was a child of privilege!
His family was well off, if not rich.
His uncle owned a string of Buick dealerships, up and down the East Coast.
I don't remember what his father did, but they were well off.
I did not like Henry.
And I did not like being compared to him and always coming out in third place.
I never did that to my son or my grandsons.
I have seen wives try to do this to their husbands!
"Why aren't you like so and so!
He coaches soccer, is president of the PTA, and is this and that."
I actually had a woman try to compare her husband to me, in front of both of us!
I drew her up short!
Quickly!!
Two people are not the same.
We are all different!
We all have different experiences, skills, abilities, strengths, weaknesses, and habits.
In any case, I have always hated being compared to others.
But, some neurologists and other doctors have tried this with me.
I treat them the same!
I let them know that my experiences with LBD are exactly that, MINE!!
What I am experiencing is most likely different than the next person.
Yes, we have some similar experiences.
But even those may be experienced differently or at different times or frequency.
My point is, lost, I suppose.
I was sitting here, alone, living in the past.
I had an urge to call my mother on the telephone, just to talk, be noise, and see how she was.
Then, Henry and how my mother treated me came to mind and I got angry and upset and decided not to call her.
Which is good, because she died in 1991.
But, that fact escaped me for a while.
Now, I am sure some of my fellow LBD sufferers experience the same sort of mental confusion.
But, their's is probably different than mine.
But we all are on this confusing journey, thing to make sense of where we are and where we are going.
Of course, we will never figure that out.
Maybe I should not be left alone at home!
Or, maybe it is good to deal with the emotions of the past.
The founding Commanding Officer of SEAL Team Six, Dick Marcinko, a fellow Slovak, used to say: "Pain is God's way of letting you know you are still alive!"
I wonder if that applies to emotional pain?
If so, my brain is still alive!

As I wrote earlier, yesterday was great!
Today has been more difficult.
I was called by our realtor at 0800!
That's 8 AM!!
Is this woman nuts?
She said we had a showing at 2:30PM.
Then, an hour later she called and said we had another showing at noon.
I realize people have to look at the house to buy it.
But the stress comes when we have to get the two miniature poodles in the car and disappear for that hour or so.
We did OK for the first showing, except that we had to disrupt our friends from out of town's departure plans.
The sec on showing was not as easy,  We packed up and left well before the showing and we were headed back when my realtor called with the excuse that the showing realtor was running lat and would not be here until 4PM!
At that, I told my wife I needed to be home!
Being out of my familiar surroundings, trying to coral two poodles in the back seat of the Subaru, driving around in neighborhoods I don't want to be in is stressful and makes me angry.
And by the time I got home, I WAS angry.
SO, I went to sleep, after the late realtor took some woman around our home that was obviously not interested in the house and most likely not able to pay for it!
I have sold many homes, and I know it is stressful.
But now I have full blown LBD and I am not of the mind to put up with stupid, mental midget Realtors!!
I pray the house sells soon.

I am a NASCAR fan.
I watched a race, a few years ago, that Mark Martin won.
In the post race interview, he was in tears.
Mark said,  I know I may never win another race, so this is so emotional to me!
Today, my son and I went shooting at a new indoor range in Pensacola.
It is a "Class A" facility in all aspects.
As good as Camp Allen in Norfolk.
Just James and I.
We had breakfast, went shooting, in a very relaxed atmosphere, and the range personnel were friendly and engaging.
It was a good time and I eve shot pretty well.
Yes, my vision gives me pro blame.
I can no longer see the front and rear sights, and the target.
So, I have to line up my front and rear sights and then look at the blur that should be the target.
But, I know how to compensate.
Maybe I should change to "front sight" shooting.
The Mark Martin story came to mind and I realized this could be the last time I go shooting.
I tired easily and we were only on the range for about 90 minutes.
When I was an active shooter, I could shoot all day and still be fresh.
I remember IDPA matches at Blackwater in North Carolina where I would shoot, moving from one stage to another, all day in the heat.
Yes, I was tired at the end of the day, but I could still shoot the night shoot!
Today, I came home and took a nap.
The reality of all this is, LBD has robbed me of stamina, strength, and vision.
All things necessary to do what I have loved to do, for a long time.
Days like today illuminate the losses I have experienced.
These days bring all the is negative about LBD to the forefront.
Maybe, that is why I seldom do things like this.
When I do, I realize where I am in my journey.
Still, I enjoyed my day,  My son looked out for me all day,  He looks for the signs that am getting tired.
When I was younger, and so was he, he would complain if I wanted to leave the range before dark.
Now, he takes carer of me.
Days like today are important to me.
Bonding time with my son.
I need to make more of these happen.
Sometimes, it is hard to judge where I am in this journey.
On days like today, my position on the map that shows my journey with LBD is very evident.

<doc date=Thursday, October 9, 2014>
I have not written about my wife in a while.
I am sorry about that.
She is everything to me and I love her.
This is her second time around with Dementia.
Her father died of Alzheimer's in 1991.
Back then, there were no medicines, no memory support units, and no understanding of the Dementia patient.
If they were in professional care, they were tied to chairs if the wandered, left to themselves, and cleaned up and dressed only when visitors or family were expected.
Today, there are medicines to extend mental capacity, memory support facilities that do their best to give the Dementia paint a normal, fulfilling, interesting, life.
And more is being learned.
I have met professional caregivers through the Alzheimer's Association that have degrees in Senior Care!
That never existed when my Father In Law was suffering from Alzheimer's.
Since this is my wife's second dance with Dementia, she has some ideas as to what to expect in me.
Yet, I still surprise her.
For instance, before we knew I was affected by LBD, I would do unexpected, socially unaccepted, behaviors at Church Board meetings!
She would correct me, and even chastise me for my fooling around in an important meeting.
She, nor I, never that I had Dementia and she did not know at that time that I did not know what I was doing or that what I was doing was not acceptable.
She and I do now.
When I has a bowel accident, she never even blinks.
She just says, we can deal with this.
She helps me remember things, find the correct word, and deals with my need to always know where she is, even in our home.
She has never got anger when I ask her what her name is, or where we are, when we are laying in our bed.
She understands these issues and takes them in stride.
It was my wife and my Neurologist in Virginia, Dr. Mary Bowles, that encouraged me to write this blog.
My wife designed both of my blogs and still keeps them up to date and me on track.
She meets my every need.
She even anticipates my needs!
Let me relate something she did for me, early in this journey.
It was the night before an appointment with Dr. Bowles.
My wife wanted me to have my thought together to see her and wanted me to put together as symptoms list.
I did not want to.
I resisted her and became sarcastic.
She yelled at me and let me know this was not just about me!
She had an investment in this journey too!!
That was a very important lie eon for me to learn.
She does have a big investment in me and my well being.
She like being with me and wants me to be as well as I can be as long as God will let me.
Of course, I have to do my best and follow doctor's directions.
Now, I am a team player in this journey.
Her Dad could not help.
We never knew he was effects with Alzheimer's until her Mother died.
By then even if there was a treatment available, it was way too late.
We were blessed in that we were diagnosed early, by a tenacious Neurologist, and medicines were developed that would help me maintain or at least slow the progression of my Dementia.
Now, I am loosing mental ground at a faster rate.
We see evidence of that everyday.
I compare this to a slow leak in a tire.
n the beginning, the tire stays up and you can drive.
Then, as you loose more air, you can feel the car handle different.
Little by little, you notice the car does not drive the way it did.
Then, you hear the flopping noise of the tire as it comes apart and no longer supports that corner of the car.
I am at the stage where the handling is getting worse.
The tire is still there, but after loosing half of it's air, the car wobbles and sways, as goes down the road.
My wife has her hands full with me.
But she manages it well.
I am blessed to be her husband.
Thanks Linda!

I am in a period of stress and anxiety.
Our house is on the market.
We are under contract at a CCRC.
We have given them $35k and our apartment is in the process of being remodeled.
We are on the hook for a substantial last payment and monthly payments that are bigger than anything I have ever seen.
The sale of our home is required for this to work.
Even the mention of budget, payments, or money makes me sick.
Now, before someone writes me and tells me everything will be OK.  Or even that God has this in His hands.
I know that!
But, my mind does not process things like this in a manner that even relates to logic, truth, or faith.
Instead, I for into panic, fear, and depression.
I get angry, defensive, and my fight or flight emotion kicks in!
I have had many long thoughts and dreams about running away!
Really!
Running away, hiding, being homeless, and never having contact with this life again!
Serious stuff, I know.
But it is where my mind escapes too.
Those of you without LBD need to understand that those of us with LBD do not have a mind that deals with reality like yours does.
My mind is broke and does not function like it used to.
For instance, social filters.
You know, saying things in a social environment that are not appropriate.
That was early in the journey.
Now, I panic when I face change, or difficult situations, or even normal daily issues.
When we are at Azalea Trace, I am comfortable, even happy.
I feel it is the best place for both of us.
When we are win our apartment, even in it's pre-remodel state, I feel at home.
Today, we spent time there planning where our furniture will go.
But, now, a few hours later, I am in a panic.
Overwhelmed, frightened, and depressed.
So, I will retire to my bed and escape to sleep. 
</doc>
<doc date=Monday, October 6, 2014>
First of all, thanks for all the well wishes and prayers connected to our acceptance at Azalea Trace.
We are very blessed to be moving into this exceptional community.
I have been very open about our desire to move to a CCRC and I have received many strange looks, quizzical looks, looks of disdain, and questions about my sanity!
The last should have been know by anyone who has know me more than a week!
But the biggest question I get after; "Why would you do that?"
is;  "Is that a place where they take ALL OF YOU MONEY!?"
The simple answer is NO.
But, they do have an entrance fee that is substantial.
Some CCRC's have lower Entrance Fees.
Some have NO entrance fee.
That's correct!
Some have no entrance fee.
However, in those communities, if and when you need assisted living or skilled nursing care, you pay at the going rate of that time.
Now, if you are just retiring, with no know major health issues, a no fee community would be good or even the best for you.
But if you are relatively sure you will need more care in the future than you or your spouse can provide on your own, a community that locks in your costs may be the answer.
It certain was for us.
Then, there is the tax break.
No, up front I will tell you I am not a tax attorney or a CPA.
You must check with the IRS, your attorney, and your CPA on any tax information.
However, my research tells me that a significant part of the entrance fee and the monthly living costs can be tax deductible as medical expenses because you are purchasing health care in advance.
Much like your premium on your medical insurance.
Now, most of us never reach the threshold of medical deduction, but with the entrance fee, you may.
Again, check with you people.
The other reason we are moving is peace of mind.
I cannot do home maintenance anymore.
Heck, I can't do personal maintenance anymore.
I need to wear my glasses to safely shave.
I am not permitted on ladders, after I cut the beam my ladder was leaning on at our Home Church in Virginia Beach!
Me, the saws all, the 2X10 beam, and a 20 foot extension ladder all came down at he same time!!
Scared Pastor Fred to death!
So, you can see, home maintenance is not in my future.
Living at Azalea Trace provides all we ever wanted and more.
Is is costly.
Yes.
But God has provided for us richly.
He set this entire move up and I trust Him for our future.
I hope this answers some of the questions we have received.
We appreciate every one's concern for our well being.
And rest assured, we will be better off in Azalea Trace than anywhere else.
Come visit us after we move in and I am sure you will agree.

I have written before about my life in my memories.
I spend a lot of my time reliving my life.
You will note I say, reliving instead of remembering.
That is because I actually can place myself in those memories, as if they are what I am doing right now.
I have had urges to call my Mother, even though she died in 1991.
I have had other urges to call or talk to other deceased relatives or close friends.
I have also had immediate feelings that I have the duty and I am late or that I need to get to work.
Today, I was shaving.
Nothing remarkable there, except I now need to wear my glasses to shave safely!
I can't see what I am doing without them.
Then, I was transported into the small bathroom of our rented home on Fairville Avenue on the west side of Cleveland Ohio.
I remember being a boy, maybe 11 or so, watching my Dad shave.
He used a shaving cream that came in a tube.
He got his brush wet with hot water from the tap, and then spread the soap from the tube on the brush.
He would then lather his face with the brush.
Then her would replace his glass.
I asked him, why do you wear your glasses when you shave.
Dad said; because I can't see what I am doing without them!
Reliving my past consumes much of my time.
Much of it is pleasant, like my memories of Dad.
Some is not so pleasant and some even upset me.
Some of these memories I cannot shake.
They stay with me all the time.
Others come and go.
Many of my mistakes and wrong doing haunt me and many times I have vivid memories of wrongs that were done to me.
I seldom think of the time I live in.
Politics upset me because I see the America  live dying.
So, I choose to actively ignore the news.
I find little interesting about the time I now live in.
The only time I am mentally engaged with the world around me is when I am teaching God's Word.
Otherwise, the past suits me fine.
Life was free of the confusion of my disease then.
It had a future and endless possibilities.
Now, I only see endless confusion with no future.
It is no wonder that my mind relives my past.

Lewy Body Dementia is such an up and down disease.
I have written about the up times I have experienced recently.
And the good days are always shadowed by the down days.
Tonight the sundowning is worse, I am angry, and while I am still in control of my emotions, I am extremely upset and overwhelmed.
This week has been extremely stressful and busy.
Yes, good things cause stress too!
But it seems the good times make the down times deeper and more drastic.
I have also written about my increasing mental disconnection and fog.
This seems worse tonight.
Things that should not or would not upset me before are enormous issues to me now.
For instance, my wife was talking about budget issues and her successes in managing our resources.
I have told you before that my wife is an expert manager of our finances.
But her talking about it caused me great stress and anger.
Now that is not normal.
So, as we travel down the LBD road, numerous bumps, potholes, and sink holes seem to cause increasing disruptions in our lives.
These disruptions are difficult for the sufferer and the caregiver, equally.
I realize that.
But, I can only deal with my side of the pain.
I am not sure my wife understands that.
And I am not emotionally equipped to tell her.

When I retired, I had a period of rebound.
Because I was away from the inherent stress of my profession, I felt better.
Less stressed.
I felt like someone had taken the 100 pound weight off of my chest!
It took a while, but that was how I felt after the initial shock of retiring wore away.
Today, we met with the facilities director to select the colors, flooring, appliances, and even the plumbing fixtures for our apartment at Azalea Trace.
After that meeting, I began to feel like the 100 pound weight had been lifted off of my chest!
I am beginning to feel like this is really going to happen!
We really are moving to a exceptional facility that is willing and able to care for Linda and myself, no matter what!
All my worry, concern, and searching will be done.
We have a CCRC that will meet our needs.
I am beginning to feel happy, secure, and even free of worry.
Yes, we have to sell our home.
But we have been on the market one day and we have already had a family tour our home!
Our home is in the ideal location in Gulf Breeze and I believe we will have no problems selling our home.
Yet, since it is not sold yet, that is a nagging issue for me.
So, when God brings the new owner of out home to our home, I will have nothing else to worry about.
Remember, I do not have any exposure to the budget.
So, those issues are left to the capable care of my wife, who is a great manager of our income and savings.
I am blessed to have her by my side.
So, things are on the up swing for me.
I know more down turns will come my way.
That is the nature of this disease.
But, outside stressors are being reduced and that is good.

Today, we passed the cognitive ability test at Azalea Trace and we are officially under contract as Life Care Residents.
This means, whatever health or mental issue occurs, we are taken care of by the facilities at Azalea Trace.
Of course, they do not have a hospital, but full rehab facilities are there as well as skilled nursing, assisted living, and memory care.
We will be in the Independent Living portion of the community.
As we walked around and ate lunch today, I could not help but be amazed at the number of people that came up to us and introduced themselves.
As you know, this has not been the common practice we have experienced here.
We ate lunch with a very nice couple that have been residents for a year.
The Husband told me, he has never regretted moving in there, as he enjoyed his custom made chocolate soda for desert!!
The Cognitive testing was administered by the RN that oversees all health care.
She was very pleasant and interested in us.
I enjoyed her.
Which is good, because her office is right next to our apartment.
Wednesday we meet with the head of Facilities to pick all the remodeling things for our apartment.
Colors, cabinets, flooring, moving walls, bathroom fixtures, everything!
That should be fun, until I have to pay for it,  But, it is our home.
I even met with the Staff Chaplain.
He offered me Pulpit time already!
Seems he needs some Sunday relief ever once and a while and he has had no one to depend on!
It was nice to be wanted again.
So, today was a good day and we feel good!
More later.

<doc date=Friday, September 26, 2014>
As I am sure you know, we are in the middle of the approval process to move into Azalea Trace, a continuing care retirement community in Pensacola.
If all goes well, we will sign our contract for occupancy on Monday.
Before that, we meet with the nurse and go through a cognitive skills test of some magnitude.
We have been assured by the staff that we will be admitted.
We did drop our medical screening reports from our doctor off today.
The next step will be to select the changes that we want made to our apartment.
We are not planning anything to drastic.
But we are going to move a wall to open up the kitchen.
Our tentative move in date is the first week of December.
So, things will begin to move quickly after Monday.
We have to sell our home, liquidate some furniture, and other home items including some larger kitchen equipment.
We will eat our main meal in the dinning room of Azalea Trace so we do n to need all the kitchen equipment required to prepare a meal for a Cruiser size ship's crew!!
Today, we went to the credit union and moved the money required for the down payment of the Entrance Fee.
We than will have to pre-pay the cost of the renovation and then, before we move in, pay the remainder of the Entrance Fee before we move in.
All of these events, issues, financial decisions, decorating decisions, have me stress and upset beyond belief!
Change is difficult for me and this will be much, much more difficult than the move to Florida three years ago.
While the end product will be good for me, the next two months are going to be tough.
I find myself getting angry and stressed whenever we discuss these issues.
My wife has to deal with these issues and she does good with me.
But I know my reactions stress her too.
I have an appointment next week with my neurologist and I am going to ask for some meds to help me deal with my anger and stress.
He has said before he could help with these issues and I am now ready to let him help me.
So, I will be adding another medicine to my daily regimen.
Living with this disease is challenge without any changes in my life.
With changes, I am overwhelmed and much more effected by my anger and stress.

I was doing some research on the Autonomic issues caused by LBD.
I have had and written about a number of these problems that I have encountered in increasing amounts.
Inability to control body temperature, urinary and bowel issues, and even vision issues.
But, today I learned about two that I did not know about.
First one is irregular heart beat.
Now, I was diagnosed with that a while ago, but was that caused by the LBD or a heart issue?
I cannot say.
Then there is the fainting!
I have had issues with the room spinning, getting dark, and me passing out or almost passing out, ever since the beginning of this disease.
Now I learn it may be caused by my Autonomic system not being able to control my Blood Pressure!
It is already documented that my BP is erratic.
But now I know, or at least strongly believe, that this is caused by LBD!
These are important symptoms to understand.
They also let me know what parts of my brain the Lewy Bodies have effected.
But it also causes me concern.
I have passed out and get very light headed very often.
What is that going to become?
And, during my recent hernia surgery, the doctor asked me when I woke up;  Do you have an irregular heart beat?
Obviously I do and now I know why.
As a person with LBD, I have found out that the research into what this disease causes and effects is up to me!!
Most doctors, including neurologists, can't even spell Lewy Body Dementia!
It's true, I have had to spell it for doctors before!!
So, discovery is up to me.
Which means, it is up to YOU if you are a caregiver or person with LBD.
This truth is sad, if you think about it.
But it is the TRUTH!
So, arm yourself with reliable information before you see your doctor or have to go to the Emergency Room.
It may save your life!

Today, we had to go get my wife's medical exam for our pending admission to the Continuing Care Retirement Community.
After that, my wife recommended we get a haircut.
The lady who cuts my hair cuts my Wife's bangs also.
She does a good job, but she is set up in a women's beauty parlor with all the ugly smells of those places.
I know because my biological Mother lived behind a beauty parlor and I lived with her for about a year.
That is another story, but suffice to say, I got myself in a lot of trouble because she worked until 2AM every night!!
In any case, the barber was taking a long time with the fellow before us and after she was done with the haircut she was doing smart phone training for the idiot she had just barbered!!
After ten minutes of this foolishness, I stood up and asked her, loudly, are we cutting hair or selling cell phones?!
She told the patron I was kidding and I convinced these two fools I was certainly NOT kidding!!!
The fellow slinked off, apologizing to me.
I did not accept his weak apology.
I would rather have kicked his but!
Then my wife sat in the chair for her short trim.
I was in a seat, around the corner from where the barber chair was, so I could not hear their conversation.
The barber told my wife;  "It's OK, I understand, my Mom has dementia too."
It was nice that she understood and my wife appreciated that.
Earlier in the day, at my Wife's doctor's appointment, a topic, I will not divulge, that is very emotional for me, came up.
I exploded loudly in the doctor's waiting room!
I walked around outside of the office while my wife had her appointment.
I was calmed down by the time she came out.
The point here is, I am loosing my control of my temper!
Thing that aggrieve me or anger me I now let whoever is near know.
I realize this is a product of the failure of my social filters.
But, it is a big negative step in the progress of this disease for me.
Believe me, I try to control my temper and in the past, I have done well.
But recently, very recently, that control has failed.
Especially when I am tired or it is the evening and my sun downing has taken effect.
Clearly, the Lewy Body tangles have finally disabled the portion of my brain that controls my emotions.
I have also had a strong urge to cry recently.
Another classic symptom of dementia.
So, here we go dealing with a new issue.
I wonder how this is going to turn out?

<doc date=Friday, September 19, 2014>
I have commented before about how real my dreams are.
Many times, I wake up, continuing what I was doing in the dream.
Then, long into the day, I realize I was "Chasing a Dream" in reality.
I have had a continuing dream theme that has be owning and operating a large motor yacht.
I am at the helm and we are going at a breakneck speed.
No matter what I do, how I turn the wheel, or adjust the throttles, I cannot control the boat or direct it's course.
Then, I see a pier, and I am obviously going to crash into it!
Then, BANG!!
I crash into the pier in a ball of flame and explosions!
And I wake up.
Today, as I was drifting into the relaxation of my afternoon nap, that dream came to mind and I began to ponder what the meaning of this dream was.
Never before had I ever thought about this dreams meaning.
Nor, was it ever evident to me.
But today, the meaning became very evident to me.
The dream's meaning is loss of control, and specifically loss of the control of my life.
LBD has robbed me of that which I cherished for so many years of my life.
For most of my adult life, I have controlled where I went, what I did, and even the course of my career.
I thought!
Of course, I now know that God is in control of my life.
I also know that all the days of my life were predestined and recorded in God's book before I was formed in my Mother's womb!
Those of us with any dementia, will, eventually loose control of our lives.
But, truthfully, we never have control of our lives.
That personal control is just a mirage in our minds.
And I have learned that there is "Peace" in understanding the fact that we are never in control and surrendering control to God is the answer to inner peace.
Now, that dream will no longer haunt me.
I am at peace with my disease and the results of it.
Now there is knowledge worth having!

<doc date=Tuesday, September 16, 2014>
We are very busy this week.
Well, busy for us.
we have to complete our required medical screening for our admittance to Azalea Trace.
That includes a TB test.
We also have a birthday party this week for a friend.
But, the big events are the Subaru Dealer's class on our new Outback and the Realtor placing our home on the market, both on Thursday.
All of these events take their toll on me.
For instance, today we had my doctor's appointment for the screening and then we had to take our 11 year old miniature poodle to the Vet for an annual check up.
So, by the time I got home, I was beat.
We even ordered Pizza instead of cooking!!
I will pay for that tomorrow.
One of the things that happens often happened again today.
Our Vet, who is a good Vet and congenial man stepped on my mental land mine!
He said, I did not look or act like I had dementia!
I was nice and he recovered well.
I still get sensitive over those comments.
Why, because I feel the person is calling me a liar or a goldbrick!
He probably was not, but that is the effect of those comments on me.
Think of it this way.
A person with cancer, say Leukemia, does not loo physically sick in the beginning or even middle of their disease.
But, when they tell someone they have Leukemia, that person does not say;  You don't look sick?
Are you sure that is right?
Instead they say;  Sorry to hear that.
How are you doing?
Is the treatment giving you problems?
Or, You are looking good.
See the difference.
I know this seems petty to you.
But it IS an issue for me.
So, file that away for future reference!
Now, I know some of my good friends, especially my Navy friends.
They will "Burn" me every time they get a chance now.
Don,  You don't look sick.
Who did you pay for that diagnosis?
Did the VA do it?
Those are sugar pills aren't they?!
Yes, I can see it coming now.
At least I will be prepared.
For those of your who are caregivers, those of us with LBD get treated like our disease is a fantasy, we don't have it, or we have something else, by doctors everywhere.
When we tell a new doctor we have LBD, almost always, we get that blank stare, followed by the quizzical look, followed by; WHAT?!
So, be sedative to our emotions on this topic.
I am much more sensitive in the evening or when I am tree, or when I am on a downward swing with the disease.
And, since you, the caregiver should know when we are in these sensitive conditions, you could defend us and deflect some of the comments.
Either that, or watch me punch some one's lights out!
Your choice.
I will be very glad when we are finally moved into Azalea.
Then, I will be able to stop putting on the show of normalcy.
I can't wait!

Today, my wife took me to our Church early in the morning because it was Team Six's week to mow the 5 acres of our land.
I enjoy these outings because the Church has great mowing equipment and it is fun to mow the back 40!
But today, something new happened.
I was mowing back and forth in the back property of the Church.
I was mowing around some mature trees and I got confused as to which line of trees I was mowing.
So, I went to the next tree which was the wrong row.
I actually got LOST, mowing a big lawn!!
It took me a few minutes to know I was lost and even longer to find where I was mowing.
So, there were 54 inch mowed paths that went in circles and lines going no where until I figured out where I originally was.
I was laughing at myself, almost uncontrollably!
Now, while this is not a life threatening situation, it is a good example of how easily I get disoriented.
Something as simple as mowing in a straight line with a row of trees as a guide was completely beyond my, now reduced, mental ability.
This is why I never go anywhere alone and why I feel so frightened when I am home alone.
I never leave the confines of our home when my wife is out.
Again, I was not frightened today.
Instead I found my situation funny!
But, I also understand that what I used to do is now very difficult for me.
Another lesson from Mr. Lewy.

There is a story about an older fellow, who goes to his doctor and says;  I am worried about my wife.
I think her hearing is going!
The The man said he asked his wife to have her hearing checked and she reduced.
So, the man wanted to know if the doctor had an easy way for him to check and see how bad his wife's hearing was getting.
The doctor recommended that the man stand a fair distance away from his wife and make a statement in a normal tone and volume of voice.
Then, if she did not reply, close the distance by half and repeat himself.
Then, if she did not answer, come right behind her and repeat himself again.
So, that evening the man saw his wife at the kitchen sink.
He stood on the opposite side of the kitchen and asked his wife; What's for dinner sweetheart?
No reply.
So, he closed the distance by half and asked again; What's for dinner sweetheart?
No answer again!
So, he moved right behind her at the sink and asked again;  What's for dinner sweetheart?
His wife turned around to face him and said;  For the third time, meatloaf!!
Why did I relate this story to you?
I know I am deaf!
It is documented and my ears ring all the time.
But recently my wife is experiencing the symptoms of hearing loss.
It could be from being married to me.
I am loud!!
No one ever says they cannot hear what I said!!
I believe I speak loud because I cannot hear!
At least that makes sense to me.
Sort of cause and effect!
In any case, my wife is just like the woman in the story.
She will not go to the doctor and have anything new checked out.
He memory issues, hearing issues, nothing!
So, a few days ago I wrote about my wife's symptoms of dementia.
She has a genetic connection to Alzheimer's since her father had Alzheimer's and died from it's complications.
She also has the Tricresyl Phosphate connection with me.
So, there are at least two reasons to get checked for dementia.
Of course, I approached the topic, with little luck.
With the pending move to Azalea Trace,  I will not add any issues because I do not want to add any stress for her.
She has enough.
But, after we are settled, I will start out across the room and ask;  What's for dinner sweetheart?!
We will see how that works then.
The joke is courtesy of Betty Lou Jackson, who I worked with and endured many tough times with.
It is her Wisconsin humor!

Hopefully you know that I suffer from Lewy Body Dementia.
I believe, and my neurologist believe that this disease was at least partially caused by my extreme exposure to the hydraulic fluid that all the gun mounts and missile launchers ran on in the Navy.
In 1989, the Navy put out a message informing us that Mil-F-17111 had a chemical in it that caused cancer and was neuro-toxic.
The Navy then removed Mil-F-17111 from every system and replaced it with Mil-F-17111A or B, I forget, that had the chemical removed.
Flight Attendants won a case for compensation for Dementia caused by long term exposure to the same chemical!
However, the Veteran's Administration has denied my claim up to now.
Today, my wife and I were discussion issues and she asked me if I had noticed any mental decline in her.
Since my mental filters no longer work, thanks to LBD, I immediately replied; Yes!!
She asked me what I noticed and then she confirmed that she was noticing the same issues.
They shadow my early symptoms of dementia!!
How could she bee impacted by Mil-F-17111?
Easy, she washed my uniforms for years!
When we were in home port, I brought my dungarees, and later my wash khaki's home to be washed.
They were covered with Hydraulic Fluid!
Then, when I taught at Gun School, Great Lakes, teaching maintenance on the MK 42 Gun Mount, I was covered in Mil-F-1711 daily and my wife washed those uniforms.
Then, after retirement from the Navy, I went to work as a Tech Rep for the Navy at NAVSEACENLANT.
More hydraulic fluid soaked clothes for my wife to wash!
I believe there is a connection here.
So, I have a confirmed diagnosis of LBD and she may have some form of dementia.
Wow!
We will monitor progress and report as required.

<doc date=Sunday, September 7, 2014>
I write this blog as information for family and friends.
I also write it to describe how I react and how I am impacted by this disease.
I also use this blog as a place to blow off steam!
My wife does not read my blog because she believes this is my private place.
I have encouraged her to read these posts, and once and a while, sh reads a large grouping of posts.
I have no secrets but I do need a place to express my frustrations.
Yes, I see a psychologist once a month and I discuss mush of what I write here.
He know all!
I am having great difficulty dealing with the stress of the possible move to Azalea Trace.
Even the prospect of selecting flooring, cabinet, and paint colors along with deciding which walls to move, is completely overwhelming.
I would be much happier of they had a completed product that you just accepted as is.
But, for this much money up front, people expect some sort of customization.
We have spent our evening searching our files for answers to more questions than we answered to purchase our home.
The same for health issues.
Then there are all the copies of past tax returns, health plans and long term care plans.
I hope you may understand just how stressful this is.
All this stress has my stomach upset, I have a headache, and my ears are ringing very loudly meaning my blood pressure is up.
I am grouchy and snippy!
Maybe it is just time to go to bed.
But don't worry, all will be OK.  Good night.

<doc date=Saturday, September 6, 2014>
I received a comment from a person who said that I gave her husband's actions words, or something similar.
That is part of my goal with this blog.
Another  goal is to use what I am going through to help other understand what their loved one's are dealing with.
Some of us are not too adept at discussing our feelings.
I suffer from that also, when it comes to m wife!
I am reticent to tell her what hurts or upsets me.
Yes, she knows many of the issues that upset me.
But, still, I say little!
I choose to suffer in silence for the most part.
The truth is, more and more, I stay quiet about the effects of LBD on my mental abilities.
I am more open about the physical issues.
And no, not because they are easy to spot.
My constipation issues are not easy to spot!
At least until they turn into diarrhea issues!
But, this issue over the costs of future care is one I will not discuss.
Look, I feel like a burden to my wife.
I am not able to do many things I once did.
I am negatively impacted by this disease mental and physically.
I am overwhelmed to the point of tears much of the time.
Just the fact that I get in the right side of the car instead of the driver's side is difficult for me.
Then, she has to deal with me jumping around in the car, screaming she is too close to the car in front, when we are still ten feet away!!
Remember, my depth perception is getting bad.
Look folks, LBD, unlike any other dementia, negatively impacts all of the brain.
Not just memory!
For instance, I am sitting here sweating because my autonomic thermostat is screwed up by LBD.
But wait, I know  will be cold in 15 minutes.
It is like I am going through menopause!
Your loved ones are quiet abut they suffering because if they talk about it, they feel it will further diminish their position in life.
For instance, my wife's position that we must move to the CCRC because of my disease.
YES!!!
She is right.
But, I don't need to hear that from her!
It hurts me to face the fact that I am the reason we are going to be tapping the retirement accounts before we are 70!
This is almost as frustrating as someone downgrading our suffering and symptoms by saying: I have the same issue, but mine is much worse than yours!
Or, you don't look or act sick!
Are you sure you have LBD?!!
Now, you may understand why we choose to just be quiet.
We know our issues.
We deal with them.
Another awakening this evening.
I found out, I am eligible for The Veteran's Aid and Attendance  payments because my doctor's have certified that I cannot live alone and I am incapable of managing my own prescription drugs!!
Now, we have too much money in our retirement accounts right now.
But that will change soon.
Just the same, this was quite a shock to me!
It is much like when OPM approved my disability retirement.
When I received the letter from OPM, my reply was; "I MUST be sick!"
Everyday, I learn just how sick I am.

Yesterday evening, we received a telephone call from Azalea Trace Continuing Care Retirement Community.
We have been on their waiting list for over a year.
Azalea Trace is the best CCRC we have looked at in Virginia, Alabama, or Florida.
In any case, Chris, our representative at Azalea called to tell us he had a apartment for us to look at.
Linda and I went today and toured a two bedroom, two bath apartment that has 1200 square feet of living space, a patio, and is on the first floor.
We love it!
Of course, we get to customize the unit.
Floors, paint, counter tops, even remove some walls.
And, of course, that will cost some but it will be worth it.
We are now in the process of completing the paper work.
Financials, medical, and of course, a cognitive interview to make sure we qualify for independent living.
I think I can pass that portion.
Linda certainly can.
The cost?
a lot, but the care that is guaranteed, for life, is the draw.
They have independent living, aging in place, assisted living, memory care, skilled nursing, and rehabilitative services.
All for the same price we pay for independent living.
That is the benefit of a CCRC.
And all of this is in the same compound.
Oh, and there is the indoor, heated swimming pool, hot tub, gym, Library, auditorium, movie theater, lounges, and the dining room that included one meal a day for both of us.
We are both very excited!!
If all goes well, we will be moved in before Christmas!!
I truly needed this to happen.
God knew that and made it work perfectly, in His perfect timing.
Praise the Lord!

OK, now I understand how General Custer felt at the battle at Little Big Horn!
I am sure he rode in, full of confidence, vibrato, and self-assurance.
Then, there were more Indians that he could count!
Then he thought; Oh no, this is not going to end well for me!
And it didn't.
And tonight, I did not start to see that I was loosing my battle with LBD.
I realized my battle was lost!
There is a big difference in those two revelations.
Today, actually tonight, "Show Time" failed.
And when I returned home from our Son's home, I was deeply depressed and in despair.
I deal with depression all the time.
But this is different.
Little changes are happening that I notice and they tell me, I lost.
Yes, I always knew that.
But I never admitted it to myself.
Tonight I did.
I now see the negatives and not the positives.
I now know much of my plan for the future will not come to fruition.
Eve promising things like the Continuing care retirement community seem unattainable now.
Remember what the "Borg" said in Star Trek?
"Resistance is futile!!"
and it is!
So, why fight it?
Resistance is futile.
I really have tried to put a positive face on this and on my life.
I have been brave, tough, and indomitable, as it said in Corporal Tony Stein's Medal of Honor Citation.
But, those are phony fronts, facades!
The truth is, I no longer want to fight, use "Show Time" or pretend I am OK.
I do not know how long I have had this disease, but I am SURE it has been long enough!
Resistance is futile...

<doc date=Tuesday, September 2, 2014>
Almost every night I experience deep depression and the feeling of despair that leads to the feeling of crying.
Sometime simple things bring this on, like a television show, or the lack of a show.
It seems silly, but a simple thing like a show I like being canceled can bring on depression.
There are other issues that cause me problems too.
Like a dream during my daily afternoon nap or doubt about the future.
The drugs I take for depression do nothing for me, in my estimation.
The next visit to the neurologist I intend to address this issue.
Since this depression and emotional upheaval impacts my desire to do most anything,  it would be better for me if I could find a way to reduce this issue.
That thought is me, fighting against the inevitable!
Even though I have had a solid diagnosis for quite a while, I still think there is a way for me to be normal again.
I have read a number of posts from other LBD sufferers related to "Show Time" behavior.
It seems those of us with LBD can muster a "normal" appearance when we have company, go somewhere, or see our doctor.
I do not allow "show time" to happen during a doctor's appointment.
But, it does come into play at Church, during our Ministry at the Assisted Living Facility, and when we have company.
I have noticed that the limits of "show time" have become shorter of late!
For instance, at our Son's house during a Birthday get together for our Son.
As the sun began to set, I felt my energy drain and my control over my emotions leave me.
My wife noticed this and we departed for home.
It is good when your wife/caregiver knows the warning signs.
One of the depressing factors of LBD is the many things that fail because of the effect of the Lewy Bodies as they settle into a portion of your brain.
I have wrote before about how REM sleep disorder first set in.
Now, my vision is being impacted.
Judging distance, peripheral vision are not what they used to be!
Of course, their is the loss of control of bowels and urine, body temperature, and recently, I see my blood pressure becoming erratic.
LBD takes it's tole in slow, sneaky, silent ways.
One day, you can see, the next day, not so well.
These slow degradations of life functions bring on the emotional issues.
So, it is a round robin for me.
There is no victor with LBD.
Just the reality that things will progress on their own schedule no matter what I do.

<doc date=Friday, August 29, 2014>
I wrote a couple of days ago about how happy I was with our new car.
And I still am.
But, that emotional high has been replaced by the issues of LBD.
For instance, yesterday, we were in a store and I was pushing the basket.
I could not see anything.
No, I was not blind, but my distance judgement and perception were so impaired that I was running into everything and tripping over things as I walked.
Then today, we went to the Commissary and I had the same issues.
I actually ran into a pole in the aisle.
LBD has a habit of tang away the things you took for granted before!
Like seeing things in their proper perspective!
These setbacks cause emotional distress for me, and others with LBD I am sure.
I get frustrated and depressed over these issues.
Tomorrow, I will try to recapture the Spark of the new car.
Tonight, I am just going to rest.
More later.

We have been blessed with the purchase of a new Subaru Outback.
I wanted this model because it has all the new electronic safety devices like Blind Side alert, rear cross traffic alert, and Eye Sight, which stops the car if we do not!
It is a technological marvel!
But this car has invigorated me to wax, seal, polish, and learn!
I have done more in the last couple of days than I have in a long time.
I have been online learning about new Nano Technology car waxes, UV protection for dashboards and tires, and learning how to operate all the new technology in this wonderful car.
I have always loved cars.
I have always lusted a Corvette!
But this 2015 Subaru Outback has really excited me.
And that level of excitement is god for me!
I feel good!
What I have learned from this is;  I need something that interests me.
I need something to work on.
And I need to be passionate about something.
Without these things, I turn inward, and that is not good.
But, I suspect that is the same for most people and the vast majority of Dementia patients need something to bring passion into their lives.
At least, I did.
And I have it now, and I am glad.
Can I work in the heat as long as I used too?
No.
But, I do work and I enjoy the results of that work.
The car looks brand new!
Oh, it is.
But what I am doing will keep it that way for a long time.
Which is how long it will last!
I expect this Outback will be the last car I ever purchase.
See, not all I write is negative!

I had my monthly meeting with my psychologist today.
He has been a key member in the management of my journey with LBD.
He is s new addition.
Well, relatively new.
I really do not know how long we have been meeting.
What I do know is I can tell you is I discuss issues with him that I do not reveal to anyone else!
And having that person is necessary in the management of this disease, in my estimation.
Today, we discussed some of my fear issues.
Some of these, I do not reveal to anyone else.
The fact that I can openly discuss these things, helps me understand them and in turn, he helps guide me on that path.
He has never told me HOW to solve or deal with an issue.
But, he has caused me to delve deeper into my feelings, emotions, and root causes of these issues.
I left his office feeling more on top of my game!
I had a good day as we ran some errands in town and I have continued to feel good the rest of the day.
It is like a massage for the mind!
Some of you may question this openness with an outsider.
Why can't I tell my wife about these issues?
Well some of my issue are caused by her or made more difficult by her.
Not purposefully, and not intentional.
Some things are her actions, responses, or lack of responses.
He has helped me address issues with my wife that I was uncomfortable to address before.
Another fact is, I was afraid to talk to a psychologist.
It was my GP that recommended me to a psychologist.
And that referral has really helped me.
So, if you are a person with any type of dementia, I recommend you partner with some type of professional counselor.
If you are the spouse/caregiver of a LBD or dementia patient, do not be threatened by this new member of the team.
That person will help both of you deal with your journey.

It is 9:30 PM, I am up, alone, the television is off, I am having my usual hallucinations of small animals running on the floor, and I feel lonely and abandoned.
And this is normal for me, now.
In the beginning of this journey, I felt connected to life.
I had friends that I saw on a regular basis and that I could see almost anytime I wanted to..
They were happy to see me and I was always happy to see them.
Now, I am alone with the exception of my two loyal miniature poodles.
It is good to have them, because if I see something and they don't bark, I know it is a hallucination!
Alone and abandoned is probable a normal issue for LBD patients or most dementia patients.
As I retreat into the world as my mind sees it, I become more isolated from society, people, and reality.
Even when I go to place with people I at least have a connection with, I am alone.
They do not know who I am or anything about my background.
Yes, we have polite conversation.
But nothing substantial and nothing that would challenge my mind.
Last weekend, we went to dinner with my son and his family.
One of my Daughter in Law's sisters were there and her husband and a couple of the grandson's friends.
I told some sea stories to my son's brother in law and he suffered listening to me.
AS we left, I picked up the tab.
I had cash, but I could not decide if the money I had was sufficient to pay the bill.
Yes I saw the numbers, but they did not compute.
I used my credit card, but did not line out the tip portion so the restaurant could have charged me anything they wanted!!
Again, I was not connected to life around me.
I was alone.
The people around me do not know these things happen to me.
Even my wife missed the issue in the restaurant!
I told her and she will take care of any bill paying in the future.
But, because no one knows what I am going through, they don't pay attention to me and in my mind, they don't care.
When I had friends, I made it my business to understand the issues in their life.
Now that I am dealing with a disease that is not outwardly apparent, people just abandon me.
I am a throw away person.
Not interesting, worthless, and a burden on their time.
No one comes to visit, no one calls, except my best buddy Jerry in Virginia.
Hell, the fellow I played Ping Pong with, who has Parkinson's, does not even want to play Ping Pong with me anymore.
He never calls!!
I am depressed.
I know that.
But, there dis little I can do about it.
Another thing that drives me further into my own mental prison is when people do ask me how I am doing, and then DISCOUNT my issues by telling me how bad they have it!
Gee, I am sorry that I infringed on your pity party.
So, I become more and more alone.
And more and more unhappy with life.
If you have a LBD patient that you are taking care of, take heed.
They are suffering from exactly what I am.
Do something to help them relate to people.
Break down their prison walls.
Look at us as people with social needs, not as a burden on your life.
Or, just put just in a nursing home and leave us alone!!
Maybe that would be better for all concerned.

I have written about Sun Downing issues.
Another part of this issue is my now non-existent social filters!!
For instance, tonight as is my norm, I was studying for the Bible study I present at the local Assisted Living Facility.
I normally use a room that is mine, in the front of the house.
I can see the street and I enjoy that room.
It has my Navy memorabilia in it and is furnished to suit me.
My two miniature poodles are always by my side.
But, people walking on the street cause them to bark.
That lead to me blowing up tonight!!
Now, the wife and both dogs are upset!
In the past, I would have handled that differently.
Not tonight.
Now I had to go all Master Chief on them!!
And believe me, I can yell loud.
This happens often now.
I have an ongoing disagreement with my Subaru salesman that I escalated to the owner!
I received a call from the sales manager at a time when I was calm, in the middle of the day.
So, things are calm now.
But I email some things I would do not have in the past.
Why?
You might say I don't care!
But the truth is, I don't have the social filters to sort out what I should say or not say.
This can be a big issue!
Like telling Adult Content sailor stories and jokes to my Grandsons.
They like it, but my wife seems to think I am wrong.
Me, I don't see an issue.
Other times, I say things that are offensive, even secret!
Again, at the time, it seems OK to me.
These issues leave me feeling alone, unwanted, and devastated.
The dogs are still not talking to me.
I also DO things that are socially not acceptable and at the moment, do not understand why.
I wrote about an incident like that a while ago.
If someone is doing something I do not agree with, I will probably "Flame Spray" them now.
I did that once, in a very crowded Pannera Bread store when I was placing a large order after waiting in line for a while.
The person taking my order, stopped and answered the telephone and took and filled that telephone order, leaving me standing there.
It was before I could not drive alone and my wife was not there to control me.
Bit did he get it!!
The Manager came out from the back, probably because he heard the walls vibrating.
and solved the situation.
Other people were looking for cover!!
I can be abrasive.
This disease has many issues, some not listed on any Symptoms list.
This is one of them and it is getting harder for me to be civil.
I hate that, but there is no control in me anymore.

<doc date=Tuesday, August 12, 2014>
I know I have written about this a few times, but I admitted tonight that this is getting worse.
I told my wife that we must address this with the neurologist.
I notice an increase in my anger and agitation as the sun goes down!
I can still control this rage, but I am not sure how long that will continue.
I have read about other LBD sufferers and their battle with agitation and rage on the LBDA.org website.
Well, mostly, I read about the caregiver's battle with the LBD patient's agitation and rage.
I have read about ways to control or mitigate the issues of the patient.
Maybe some of those will work for me.
But, I am not sure I can get my wife to massage my feet for hours!
When I am in this state, the things that are unresolved and not going the way I want them too become issues and the center of my agitation.
For instance, my dislike for the area of Florida I am a prisoner in.
I am sure you have seen that is prior posts.
Then there are things that have always caused me issues, like TV volumes going up for commercials or bad audio drink a program I want to watch, like football games.
Of changes from what I know is my schedule and routine.
For instance, "Unforgettable" was not on Sunday night as scheduled!!
I was livid!
This issue is becoming more disturbing to me and probably to my wife, but she never let's on.
My wife is a tough Navy wife!!
I am sorry that I am putting her through this!
That is my biggest, most devastating, regret!
So, hopefully my neurologist can help.
Otherwise, I am going back to drinking, a lot!

<doc date=Monday, August 11, 2014>
OK, as you could tell from last night's post, I was suffering from agitation and frustration.
We spent our weekend helping our son and his family move into a home thy have recently purchased.
It was a good move, but that much exertion always has it's pay backs.
It seems that my mind wants to do what my body, mental capacity, and stamina cannot!
In Navy terms, my butt is writing checks my body can't cash!
And remember, I cleaned that up for you civilians.
But, after two days of harder work than I have done in a long time, I was done.
And it showed in my demeanor last night.
After a good night's sleep, I am just my grumpy old self!
And not agitated.
Today, I am home alone for the first time in a long time.
I enjoy solitude and quiet.
Especially after the weekend.I puttered around the house, but mostly I just enjoyed the quiet.
No television, radio, or discussions.
Just quiet.
Now don't mistake my calmness for liking Florida.
This is still the most unfriendly, backwater, scum bucket of a place to live, that I have ever seen.
At least in Pascagoula Mississippi, they are glad to see your money!!
The lady across the street died last Friday night.
She had cancer and fought it for a long time.
She was on experimental chemo drugs, and after three different experimental drugs, she died, in her sleep.
He husband, Fred, woke up Saturday morning to her, dead, next to him.
She was young, not yet 60!
She had lost her rite arm to the cancer, and other body parts.
She was a tough old bird, and I will miss her.
Her husband is taking it hard.
I visited him today.
We talked, but he is not really there.
His nerves are still to raw to deal with reality.
That brought me to my thought on living.
God only give us a preplanned, infinite, number of days to live.
That number is predetermined before we are born.
God also gave us a free will!
We can spend those days any way we want to.
We can accept his "Free Gift" of Salvation through the sacrifice of His Son, Jesus Christ, or we can deny it.
Of course, as with any decision we make in life, there are consequences!
But, it is our choice.
My choice is not to live in the panhandle of Florida anymore.
Of course, that decision has consequences,  And like this weekend;  My mind may be making a decision my butt can't cash!!
Probably so.

<doc date=Sunday, August 10, 2014>
I have written before about my disdain for the East Lower Alabama, (i.e.
The Panhandle of Florida) part of our dysfunctional country.
This is the end of the line for technology, shopping, intelligence, entertainment, and news casters!
The local television and radio news casters are the bottom of the barrel.
There are no national stores of stature.
There are no luxury car brand dealers here.
Funny, Mobile has a Lexus and Infinity dealer.
Mobile!
No, the panhandle of Florida is the end of the line in may ways.
But today, I found out how backwater this place is.
They do not have a radio station that carries the Motor Racing Network (MRN)!!!
I cannot get a NASCAR race on the radio!!
Just shoot me know!!!
I got the MRN in Dahlgren Virginia!!
Now these idiots that cannot read or write root for college football team like they own them!
Go figure.
Just to illustrate my point.
As you enter Alabama, from Florida, on Interstate 10, there is a large, billboard with the cartoon figure of a car that struck a large tree.
The caption is;  Collisions with trees can kill you!!
Do they really need a billboard for that fact of life.
No, East LA is the next step to a third world country.
Cities that cannot handle rain water and let their people flood, and leave that water there for three weeks!!
Newscasters that are ignorant, unable to speak english, and report dribble.
No shopping, no services, no seniors communities, and no way for me to live.
I wish I could change this, but, I am powerless.
Getting old is not for wimps.

I have had some comments from readers about how I report the progress of my disease in the coherent manner that I do.
Good question.
Some would say I am a ruse or a charlatan.
Others might say that I have good and bad periods and that I write during the good periods.
Yet others may say that my wife or some other "Ghost Writer" writes these posts.
Well, none of those theories are correct!
First of all, I can assure you that I am the writer of every post, except one that my wife wrote.
She identified herself as the author of that post, and in fact, I would like her to write more about her experience as my care giver.
Second, I can assure you that I indeed DO have LBD and the symptoms I report are happening to me.
I do have good and bad times, as all other LBD patients have.
It is one of the signature symptoms of LBD.
But, I will tell you that I believe God has given me the ability to clearly report what is happening to me in order to unmask the terror of Lewy Body Dementia and other Dementia's.
Yes, God is my enabler!!
I am blessed with a wonderful wife that takes exceptional care of me with unbelievable patience.
She now is in control of every aspect of my life.
Meds, finances, driving, appointments, even what I watch on television.
My wife controls everything in my life.
She understands the disease and where I am in my journey.
She had noticed the recent degradation of my mental capabilities and also the changes in my physical symptoms.
She rescued me when I began to shake uncontrollable while serving Communion at our local Assisted Living Facility.
I am doing as well as I am because of her care.
I will continue to report as long as I am able.
Then, she will write one last post for me.
I greatly appreciate your readership and the relationship we have formed because of this disease.
Be tough, but always lean on God for your strength.

<doc date=Wednesday, July 30, 2014>
We lead a Bible Study at the local Assisted Living Facility.
I enjoy this weekly event.
To call this a Bible Study is a little miss leading.
Every week, I deliver a 30-45 minute sermon to ten or so lovable seniors.
They range in age from 70 to 97!
All of them are sharp as tacks and follow along in their Bibles.
They will stop me in a micro-minute if they disagree or if they do not see where I am reading or quoting.
We also conduct a Communion Service the last Thursday of the month.
We have been providing this ministry for over two years.
On the days that we provide Communion, we always offer Communion to any individuals that cannot venture out of their rooms for one reason or another.
Today, while we were offering Communion to one of our regulars in her room, my left hand began to shake uncontrollably while I was holding a small tray with the Bread and Wine on it.
My wife acted quickly and nothing was spilled.
This is not the first time I have had hand shaking issues but it is definitely the most concerning.
Most of my parkinsonian symptoms have been the rigidity and stiffness in my legs and now in my arms and shoulders.
But shaking is starting to increase.
I also notice it when I lift my coffee cup or pour coffee out of the pot.
It seems things with some weight cause the shaking.
This could be related to the rigidity issues and the muscles fighting with themselves.
Or not.
But it is an increasing issue.
So, as is my purpose for this blog, I am sharing another change in my condition in hopes of keeping you informed and maybe being a help to  to others dealing with LBD.

<doc date=Friday, July 25, 2014>
Since I have been afflicted by LBD, some things have become a weigh on my outlook as well as my mind.
Many of the things that some people find rewarding, relaxing, or even sought after, cause me to feel overloaded and overwhelmed.
When we lived in Virginia, my wife and I agreed to sell our house and move into a Senior's Apartment.
I truly felt free when we lived there.
I had people to talk too that were the same age as me.
I had NO maintenance.
And I had no worries.
When we wanted ceiling fans installed, maintenance did it.
I wanted another cabinet in the bathroom, maintenance installed it.
There was a gym, a pool, and again, people to talk to that understood what I was going through.
The seniors even went out, once a month, for dinner and a social time.
And, any evening the weather permitted, there was a group of people, out by a garage, sitting on lawn chairs and talking.
We moved to Florida and I have none of these things and I HAVE all of the maintenance of our home and all of the worries of maintenance.
I have no one to help and everything to do.
Another weight is our future living situation.
We are on the waiting list for Azalea Trace.
That list is not moving.
I am on the waiting list for the Armed Forces Retirement Home in Gulfport Mississippi with a prospective move in date of November 2014!
That facility meets all of my needs but excludes my wife.
So, another worry there.
While we have looked at a number of communities that meet some or all of our needs, Azalea is the only one that meets all of our needs in one package.
But, they cannot even begin to tell us when we will move in.
Then there is the issue of ME passing the mental testing required to prove I am able to live independently!
Since I am experiencing progression of my mental decline, I worry if I will even be accepted at Azalea or the AFRH in Gulfport.
Now, I hope you understand the things that worry me.
I have totally given up on moving back to Virginia Beach.
But I would like to settle in palace I can relax and spend the remainder of my days, in peace, without worry about my surroundings.
That does not seem to be too much to ask for, does it?
</doc>
<doc date=Tuesday, July 22, 2014>
I have to admit, I NEVER thought I would be meeting with a Psychologist.
I was a U.S. Navy Master Chief Gunner's Mate!
We are tough, independent, leaders, that do not ask for help!!
Well, LBD taught me that I needed help.
I needed someone, who I could talk too about MY issues with this disease.
Not to mention MY issues with my Wife and family as we all deal with this disease.
And it has helped me!
Today, we discussed our trip to Iowa and my "Christmas Tree" hallucination.
His opinion was than the "Christmas Trees" impeding my trip to the bathroom represented me being trapped in my routine.
He said that I cling to my routine so hard, that my fingers hurt!
He is correct.
He also said it was good that we took the trip and broke my routine.
He was also pleased that I actually enjoyed myself and had such a good time visiting with my Wife's cousin.
All that is true.
Some of the things we discuss I will not write about.
But, it is good to be able to talk to someone, unrelated to me, without retribution, that has a professional opinion that can help I meet with my Psychologist once a month.
I find that is all I need right now.
I am totally open with him and I know he is totally confidential with what I tell him.
These meetings are beginning to help me deal with Florida and helping me feel more comfortable here.
We also discussed how secure and serene I felt in the Memory Support unit at a local retirement community that we visited.
He seemed surprised at first at my contentment with the confines of the facility.
Until I told him of my need for security and safety.
Then he understood.
So, if you are a LBD patient, I recommend a visit to a Psychologist.
It is not a sign of weakness!
It IS a sign of strength.
It takes strength to admit you need help.
I know!

<doc date=Monday, July 21, 2014>
I dream every time I go to sleep.
My dreams are very realistic.
Realistic to the point that sometimes, I continue to act on the topic of the dream throughout the day.
Many times, my dreams are about a tack or job I am working on and when I wake up, I continue to think and try to accomplish that job.
Other dreams are about people of my past that I miss.
Some of them are now passed on, some are not.
Many times, I wake up trying to contact that person, as if they were still alive.
Many times these dreams upset me.
Then there are violent dreams.
Fights, survival, Navy events involving gun mounts or small arms.
Many of these dreams cause me to actually "Fight" in my dream.
Or, I am moving my hands as if I was using tools in the gun mount.
I know this because my wife has observed these actions and been the recipient of one of my punches in my sleep.
This REM Sleep disorder is "normal"in LBD patients.
Sleep is my refuse and I like to sleep.
I nap daily and I retreat to the bed whenever I am upset, agitated, or angry.
If my two miniature poodles and I are in bed, I am secure.
Why, because if I hear, feel, or see something, and the dogs do not react, I know what I see is not real.
I did not have that insurance policy in Iowa recently when I was trapped by the Christmas trees when I got up to go to the bathroom!
That hallucination has upset me greatly.
My dreams continue to effect me and upset me.
Much like my hallucinations, they seem real to me.
And the reality of these dreams and hallucinations is increasing.
We will see where this leads.
</doc>
<doc date=Sunday, July 20, 2014>
I have been trying to figure out why I am so upset, so agitated, and why I am trying so hard to find a retirement community to live in that meets my wife's standards of location, care, accommodations, and cost.
It may be fear.
Fear of my future.
Fear of the destination LBD is taking me.
Fear of the unknown.
I am consumed over finding a safe place for me to spend my remaining days.
I know I have lost my ability to protect myself and my wife.
My hallucinations have become more real and more disturbing.
The Christmas Tree hallucination really unnerved me.
And now I know where my fear originates.
In the unknown.
My wife does not understand.
I am unable to explain.
But I am sure that I need to find that place of safety and security soon.
Am I depressed?
Yes.
I have lost my independence, my manhood, and my ability to make my way in the world.
Fear never drove me before.
It is a strange emotion for me.
But, fear is now the driver.
Not fear of death, but fear of living with LBD.
I hope I find that safe place, before I do not recognize I am there.

OK, that could be an over statement.
But, my short term and even my long term memory is degrading.
At a dinner out last Wednesday, with my Nephew and his wonderful family, I could not remember my Daughter in Law's name!
I loose thoughts while I am processing the very same thought!
This is really becoming a problem.
Right now, I have lost my entire thought process for this post.
So, I will leave it right here.
I am becoming concerned that I am loosing total control of my thought process.

<doc date=Wednesday, July 16, 2014>
We just returned from a 6 day trip to Iowa for a family reunion.
We stayed with my Wife's 94 year old cousin.
She still lives in her home, cooks, cleans house and pulls weeds in the yard!!
She is doing better than I am!
It was a very pleasant visit.
The reunion was on Saturday and there were over 100 people there.
It was a big success and a wonderful time of family members connecting.
That being said, the trip has taken it's toll on me.
For instance, either Sunday or Monday night, I had to get up to go to the bathroom.
Nothing new there.
I go out of bed and headed for the bathroom, and I was immediately surrounded by decorated Christmas trees!
No matter which way I turned, there were Christmas trees blocking my way.
They seems to have substance and actually impeded my movement.
Finally, I was able to read through the trees and feel the wall, the dresser, and finally, the door.
I also had a very vivid audio hallucination and saw a man walking across the back yard that was not there.
Since we have been home, I have been more mentally disconnected, disoriented, and confused.
I have said before that I do not travel well.
But this trip illustrated that fact even more.
It is disheartening since I was feeling pretty well before we left.
But that is the nature of LBD.
The "Up and Down" nature of this disease gives you false hope one day and despair the next.
I try not to attach too much positive energy to my "Up" days and not to be too dismayed by my "Down" days.
But, it is hard to do.
Right now, I am leveling off a my lower mental stage.
Not a bad position to have.
Level, is always my goal.
It really does not matter where I am, I just want to be on an even keel.
It is sort of like working for a boss that is a jerk one day and a good guy the next!
I would much rather work for the jerk that is always a jerk!
At least I know what I am dealing with everyday.
It is the same way with LBD.
I know this will progress downward.
So, I would rather go downward and stay there, than go down and then up and down again.
So, I do not think I will travel for a while!
I am not ready for another downward turn.
</doc>
<doc date=Wednesday, July 9, 2014>
I tell people; "I don't travel well!"
It is true, anything that disrupts my routine is traumatic to me and for me.
We have been planning our trip to Iowa for a while.
But as it approaches, I have become upset, unsettled, and hyperactive.
I am worried about my puppies care and well being.
I am worried about the hassles of travel by air.
All in all, I am a wreck.
We are also trying to plan a August or September trip to Virginia.
While I very anxious to see all my friends, the thought of another trip is daunting.
I have asked my Wife NOT to bring the second trip up until the first trip is over.
She can't follow that request.
Her mind runs ahead all the time and she is always planning for the worst.
A trait that drives me crazy, especially in my present LBD state.
But, there is no changing her and no training her.
She continues to plan ahead, borrow every problem, and drive me to distraction.
One thing is for sure, the next trip will be by car and the dogs go with us.
With Marcel the wonder Dog to calm me, I do much better.
Maybe we can get him certified as a service dog.
But, for those of you who "Own" a LBD patient, be careful not to overload us with details, plans, and problems!
Even in the early stages, these types of issues are unnerving.
For instance, the budget.
When my Wife tries to explain our budget, I get overwhelmed and angry.
Not because she does a bad job.
She is the BEST budgeteer in the world.
Our credit rating is because of her exceptional financial management.
But, the details of our budget, or even the talk of money, upsets me.
So, think hope upset I get when I get barraged with "What Ifs" about what can or will go wrong on a trip, with a purchase, or what ever.
I don't need or want to hear about issues or potential problems.
Just tell me where to be and what to do or say!!
One other point.
When we toured the "Memory Support Unit" of a Senior's Community yesterday, I noticed a man there who did not look like he belonged.
He WAS a resident of the Memory Support Unit, but he was well kept.
Shaved, hair combed well.
Clean, pressed clothes, and he was sitting, very comfortably, alone, on a couch, reading a magazine.
All the other residents looked like they belonged there.
You know the look.
Hair not quite right.
Men needing shaves.
Clothes wrinkled and disheveled, sitting in a group on a couch, staring off into space.
The man I described looked just like me!
And since I felt SO comfortable in that facility, I wondered why he was there and if I should be there!
That facility, the security, the rooms, the ambiance of the place, made me feel safe, comforted, and secure.
I find that interesting.
Maybe I am farther down the road than I think.

Today, we continued the search for an acceptable retirement community.
We have looked at quite a few communities and have our names on a waiting list for a community that is, by all accounts, the best in the area.
We have found three communities that are acceptable.
In my view, today's was the best.
The independent living portion was beautiful.
It was made up of individual cottages, all 1400 sq ft or more.
All with a garage and in home laundry.
All utilities were paid and one meal a day was provided along with weekly housekeeping.
The assisted living apartments were equally nice.
There, we would get three meals a day and therefore, the apartments did not have full kitchens.
There were microwaves and a refrigerator.
But the Memory Support unit was the best.
There were small, private rooms, with private baths.
Very nicely appointed.
Then nice common areas and outside walking and sitting areas in a park like setting.
The entire area, inside and out, was secure!
No way out for the residents.
This immediately put me at ease!
I have discussed before, that when I am home alone, I will NOT go out of the house.
I am afraid to gout on my own.
If my wife is home, I will go out, talk to neighbors, get the mail, do yard work.
But, if I am alone, I stay inside.
But walking the grounds of the Memory Support unit made me feel at peace.
Safe,  Secure.
This is a very hard decision for my wife.
There are serious financial considerations to ponder.
We have a beautiful home that I still can maintain, for now.
How long is the question.
Living in our present home is less expensive than the community we looked at today by a factor of 2.
Meaning it would cost us twice as much to go live in the community as we pay now.
So, don't think I do not appreciate the difficulty of my wife's decision.
Yet, I felt so secure, even in the independent living cottages.
My position is that we need to get into a community while I am still functioning mentally.
And we do not know how ling that will be.
Some days I am good as gold.
Others, not so much.
And the "Not so much" days are more frequent and more pronounced than they were.
In my previous position as the long term planner of the family, I believe now is the time to sell our house and move.
We disagree on this point.
My wife would like to wait for the community we are waiting for.
That wait list has not budged.
And, giving one third of our retirement savings to a management community is a little daunting for both of us.
While the community we looked at today does not require an "Up Front" fee.
Of course, they do not guarantee the price of future care either.
All of these factors make this decision the most difficult one of our life.
Maybe I should defer to my wife's clear, unemotional, mind.
But, security sure was comfortable.
Note:  There is one other option.
I am on the waiting list for the Armed Forces Retirement Home in Gulf Port, Mississippi.
We have toured this facility an it is OUTSTANDING!!
I felt totally comfortable there.
There is one issue.
It is only for me!
That may be OK since mi wife may not need or want a senior community.
According to the administrator I should be offered a room in November of this year.
We will see.
All I know is I need, maybe even crave, security!
And I need to be in a facility that will meet my needs, before those needs become the driver themselves.
I hope that makes sense to you.
Because it consumes me.
One last thought on this topic tonight.
I would feel very comfortable moving into an assisted living facility like the one we saw today.
The apartments were roomy, comfortable, and all inclusive.
That thought makes my wife feel like she is loosing her independence!
She feels imprisoned by that type of facility.
That is where we differ.
I try to look at her point of view.
But, it is hard for me to see.
And I believe the independent living portion of a community is s good compromise.
Again, maybe I am wrong and it is just my LBD taking.
I no longer can make these types of decisions based on logic.
My wants are now dictated by what I perceive I need baked on how I believe I am at the time I am making the decision.
I guess I am like a two year old!
I want what I want, now!!
There, that sums my point of view up precisely.
How is that for being totally honest?

The Church that we attend here in Pensacola is a mid size congregation.
But like any Church, they always seem to need people to do things.
Each week, the Church highlights a Missionary they support and a country in the world that persecutes Christianity.
One of the Elders that does the opening remarks asked me today to do the presentation on these subjects.
I said, no sweat!
You may know that our Home Church in Virginia Beach is Grace Community Church, a Grace Brethren Church that chose to Ordain me.
The decision to move here was a surprise to me and our Church!
I miss Grace Community Church in Virginia Beach.
I miss preaching, as a substitute, teaching Sunday School, leading Wednesday night Prayer Service, and learning from my Pastor, Fred Devan.
He taught me, mentored me, helped me mature, and encouraged me to do things for God I never thought possible.
The years I spent at Grace were the best Christian growth years of my life.
You all know I want to go home.
But, I can't.
We have a ministry at a local Assisted Living Facility where I lead a Bible Study every Thursday.
Functionally, I present a 45 minute sermon on the Chapter we are studying.
We are presently in Acts and will work our way, all the way through, chapter by chapter.
It is a good way to study God's Word.
We also bring Communion to our friends at the Assisted Living Facility once a month.
I have also had the pleasure and honor of Baptizing one of the residents.
Until now, this has been our only ministry here.
It is fulfilling, but,  wanted to preach.
Of course, Pastors guard their pulpit cautiously, as they should.
And, since i am only a Lay Pastor, I fully understand.
Then, there is the issue of my LBD.
The disease has progressed in the last year and my wife worries about my ability to get up in front of a large group and Preach God's Word.
I do get confused, lost, and even momentarily loose the ability to read!
Yet, when I am doing God's Work, it is "Show Time!"
Now, if you know about LBD you know patients of this roller coaster disease often put on a "Show" for company or doctors, and then go back to "Normal" when they are at home, zone, with you!
Presenting God's Word activates my "Show Time" ability.
Today, when I made the presentation about the Safe Harbor Crisis Pregnancy Center and the Islamic Country of Iran, I was sharp, clear, precise, and on target!!!
It felt very good to be behind the Pulpit, if only for 5 minutes.
In September, we will be back in Virginia Beach.
I pray Pastor Fred will offer me the opportunity to Preach.
I love serving our Lord!!
Did you go to Church today?

I the movie "REDS", a comical movie about some retired CIA operatives that get classified, Retired, Extremely Dangerous, one of the retired operatives, who is living in s rest home, tells his retired operative friend; "I never expected to end up like this!"
He goes on to briefly name all the dangerous missions he was on and then say:  "But stage 4 liver cancer, in a rest home?
never thought I would end up like this."
I can identify with the character Morgan Freeman played.
I always thought I would die on a ship, in a gun mount, or somehow doing something dangerous.
I did not shy away from danger or difficult missions.
As a matter of fact, I volunteered for them.
When I was getting ready to go back to Sea Duty, from being the Gunner's Mate Detailer, I was offered another tour in Washington D.C. as the "New Construction" Detailer.
I quickly turned it down!!
Not for me.
Now, I am dealing with Lewy Body Dementia.
A very invidious disease that ebbs and flows confusing the patient and the caregiver.
Recently my thoughts have returned to my own mortality.
At a recent Gun Show with my neighbor and my son, I said something without thinking.
The neighbor and I were looking at a gun, I do not remember which one, and he asked me if I was going to buy it?
I quickly and without forethought said:  "Hell no.
I am dieing, I don't need anymore guns!"
The sound of those words coming out of my mouth were shocking to me.
Much like that night when I laid, stuck to the bottom of a windshield after crashing face first through it.
Paralyzed, I heard a woman's voice say; "Are they dead?"
I thought, I might be!!
But, I wasn't, just knocked out.
But now, I will not rebound.
I have bounced well during my life.
Windshields, concussions, colon surgery, all no big deal.
Heck, I worked a full day after going through that windshield!!
I had to or Chief Mowery was going to punch me!
Now, I just want to sit here and rest.
No, I never expected to end up this way, but God knew I would and He made provisions for me.
A good wife, good medical coverage, a comfortable home, and a Savior to pay the price for my sins!
Maybe this is not as bad a situation as I first thought.

Today, I was told by my wife that is is my fault that our Grandsons don't pay attention to my sea stories!!
It is also me and other veterans fault that we did not talk about our war stories and the wars were told from the prospective of the liberal writers.
First of all, my grandsons were never interested in my sea stories.
All they care about is those damn video games!
If it is not on an electronic device they can play with 24/7, they are NOT interested.
Their loss.
Second, when the Vietnam war was over, we were treated with disdain in public.
Spit on, hit, cussed at, and treated with general disrespect.
The idea of telling someone about what we did or went through was dumb!
We did not need to be berated too many times before we shut up.
I can only punch so many Hari Krishna fools before I get in trouble!!
So, don't blame me or my generation.
Nor the veterans of the World Wars or Korea.
You were not interested in what we did or suffered.
You were all homes, warm, dry, comfortable, well fed, and safe, while we were doing the opposite of anything you might imagine.
You don't care now and your did not care then.
This is why I am only comfortable with Veterans and especially Navy, Black Shoe, Veterans.
My Israel Navy Master Chief friend, Oded Ogoor, used to say; "If you ain't a Gunner's Mate, your Ain't shit!!
I am not that hard over.
But I love to be with my Brothers in Arms.
Maybe I will get accepted in the Armed Forces Retirement Home at Gulfport Mississippi.
The last I heard, I would be in by November of this year.
I can only hope!!
Until then, just leave me alone!!
I am tired of being the fault of everything.

Riding in the car has become very exciting!
It seems I have an issue with the closeness of things, mostly other cars, around me.
I have screamed for my wife to stop a couple of times recently.
A couple of weeks ago, I hallucinated a car hitting us in my side of the car as we pulled out of the Church parking lot.
I remember driving with my Father in Law.
He had Alzheimer's and would offer advice, like; Go ahead and pull out, it's clear!
Just as a tractor trailer went by!!
So, I have had experience with this, but my screaming seems to upset my wife.
Imagine that.
Pulling into a parking lot is interesting also.
I think she is far to close to another car, parked in the adjacent space.
I try to apply my brakes to no avail!!
So, I scream in terror!
There is a joke going around that states; I want to die like Grandpa did, peacefully in my sleep.
Not screaming in terror as the 4 other people in the car did when Grandpa hit that Semi!!
It seems I need to go to sleep when I am in the car and then I won't be so frightened!

I have written a number of posts about how seemingly small issues are blown up into major issues for those of us with any type of Dementia.
For instance, today, we went to the Commissary for groceries.
While checking out, the bagger dropped a glass container and it broke.
The check out line came to a complete stop so everyone could clean up the mess.
Of course, I was enraged at their stupidity!!
In my professional view, they should have called "Wet Clean up on isle 6!"
and kept on doing business!
So, naturally, I let my steam boil over and got "Shushed" repeatedly by my wife.
I got angry at her for telling me to be quiet when I new the way to fix this simple issue!
I was mad because they were not doing what I thought they needed to do.
Just how stupid are these people!!
Of course, there were the stupid people in the isles shopping in those power carts!
They take up and block entire isles for hours!!
More idiots!
Or the fact that my new neighbor cuts her lawn too short.
The bottom line is, little things, that would not have made me angry in the past, now drive me into a rage at a minutes notice.
And of course, I stay agitated for a long time.
My wife and I both know it is caused by the LBD.
But that does not make it any easier for her to deal with.
She still has some influence on me.
But, that will probably evaporate in the near future.
I know others with Dementia and their care givers deal with this anger issue.
My goal is to express the emotions from my perspective.
My goal is to live peaceably with everyone around me.
LBD has the goal of keeping me from that peaceful goal.
Now, you can see my conflict.
Of course, there  is also the issue that I feel people are purposely doing things to aggravate me!
Or they are following me, seeking me out to make mad, or trying to do harm to me.
All of these emotions are active in my mind, all of the time.
Many times, I hide in bed to deal with my negative emotions.
But, when I am in public, there is no place to hide.
As I said, this will become an increasing issue.
How do I know that?
Because it has already increased in occurrence and intensity.
More to come.

If you have followed my unfortunate move to Florida, you may remember my fight with swarms of termites!!
The little monsters are everywhere each year around Mother's Day!
Seems fitting since I live her because my wife wants to be near the Grand kids.
The first two years, the winter was warm, and we had MILLIONS of termites swarming.
In the house, in the garage, coming out of the vents, the sewer vents, everywhere.
I had damage in the walls where I saw, and killed, live termites coming out of the dry wall.
This year, because we had an exceptionally cold winter, we had very little swarming.
So, I thought, good!
Then, my wife asked to look at a molding in the bathroom yesterday.
It is completely eaten by termites!!!
So, here I sit, trying to control my rage, frustration, and overwhelming desire to sell this house.
But, because of my respect for my wife and her emotions, I keep my issues to myself.
I know many people, right on our street, deal with termite issues.
But, they deal with their issues with an unencumbered mind.
I feel the bugs are actually out to get me!!
I will call our bug contractor tomorrow and he will make things right.
But, I will now forever feel violated by these Formosan aliens that want to eat MY home!!
I hate everything about Florida.
The area, the people, the bugs, snakes, frogs toads, hurricanes, torrential rains, floods, did I mention the unfriendly people!!
Yes, there is no income tax, but you pay for that with the unfriendly people!!
I am overwhelmed, alone, and empty.

There are many well meaning people in my life.
They say;  If you need anything, I will be there.
Or; If you need help, just ask.
Or, how about this?
Have a room ready, we will visit often.
We have had four visitors since we moved to Florida.
My Sister, our best friends, my active duty Navy friend and his new wife, and a lady and her husband that worked with my wife.
Only two stayed overnight.
Now, before I complain, I realize everyone has their own life.
Their own family, their own things to do.
Plus, they work and have careers, have a home to maintain, kids to deal with, and all the stresses of normal living.
Doing things for me falls low on their list and I understand.
No problem!
Recently, I had a post on the Lewy Body Dementia social media site, making my case for living close to my friends.
Someone replied in a mean manner, that my friends would not "toilet" me!
Well, neither will my family!
They have a life and responsibilities of their own too.
But at least I will be around people that know me and I have things in common with!!
I don't need care, I need companionship!
And that does not exist here in the panhandle of Florida!!
I enjoy writing this blog and my Navy blog.
But neither replaces sitting down with an old shipmate, drinking a beer, and telling sea stories!!
And as far as family goes, well, my sister visited.
My son and daughter in law have two very active teenagers to keep up with.
My son travels for his job and is seldom home and when he is, there are home responsibilities.
I understand, I was in his shoes, 40 years ago.
The bottom line is, I need friends to be with.
Can I change this.
No!
Not now.
We are waiting for the Armed Forces Retirement Home in Gulf Port Mississippi and that would fulfill my shipmate need, in that there are plant of retired Navy folks there.
Someone must have served on a Destroyer!
But, for me to ask my wife to move away from our son and his family would be selfish and inconsiderate!!
I moved her too many times.
Now IS her time!!
So, I will do my best to wait, as hard as that is for me.
Yes, I will continue to complain.
I need to vent!

<doc date=Wednesday, June 25, 2014>
I have been married for 41 years.
Much of that time, we made little money.
After I made Senior Chief, our finances started to look up.
Now, because of my many deployments, my wife has always ran our day to day finances.
She still does, even in retirement.
Why, because she is the best budget manager in the world!
I owe our credit rating, our economic accomplishments, and our financial security to my wife's magnificent financial management.
My part of our financial plan has been the long term decisions.
Early in our marriage, I had little to do.
Later, I made some good decisions that made us good interest on our savings.
Because of her day to day management and my long term planning, we have a good retirement.
But now, I see no future!
When we are told to "Wait" for admission to the ONE acceptable Continuing Care Retirement Community in the Pensacola area, I have great difficulty waiting.
I have issues that no one understands or even know about.
Why?
Because they do not look at life from the same prospective that I do.
It is IMPOSSIBLE for anyone that does not have LBD, to understand how anything impacts me.
Early in my journey, my wife angrily told me that this disease was not just about me!
Well, yes it is!!
I will admit that the way the disease impacts me has an impact on her.
But, I am the one that has these issues.
She still has a future.
It may be without me, but she still has a future and a good one.
Me, not so much.
And any future I do have will be with severe limitations.
I already cannot drive alone.
I am a quasi prisoner in my own home.
I can't even go get a haircut without an escort!!
I used to go around the world on Navy ships and go on liberty in places most of you would never think of going!
Now, I need a baby sitter.
Yes, it IS about me!!
I need to move into a community that I can have some movement in.
A place that has recreational facilities, a library, a coffee lounge, a barber shop.
A place where the people recognize me and can make sure I don't go too far.
I need some freedom, with limits, I understand, but some freedom.
That place is a long way off if at all.
So, when someone tells me to wait, that will happen in the future.
Maybe 6 months from now.
My reply, always silent, is what future?
I just don't see it.
P.S.
I said my reply to statements to the future is always silent.
This forum is my only outlet of frustration and pain.
My personal goal is to isolate my wife from as much of the frustration of LBD as I can.
I read on the LBDA.org web site about caregivers dealing with verbal and even physical abuse form their loved ones.
I never want to be abusive to her in any way.
So, as long as I am able, I will keep my emotions inside.
She has enough to worry about.
Now, I do tell her about my issues and frustrations in a soft and gentle way.
Maybe that prevents her from really understanding how these issues effect me.
This truly is a difficult thing to manage.

<doc date=Friday, June 20, 2014>
Tonight, like every evening, I sit her, absolutely angry, grumpy, overwhelmed, and pissed off.
Everything grates on me.
Noise, commercials, the dogs antics, my wife's chatter, the news, the telephone ringing, the door bell, everything!!
Every night is like this!!
Like, right this minute, there is a commercial on the television with a man YELLING!!
It sends me through the roof.
Now, I can still control my yelling and screaming.
But, more and more, I have problems even being civil to my wife at night.
She understands, but that does not make it easier on me!
I do try very hard not to yell because it causes her issues and I want to be respectful of her emotions.
Just because I have issues does not mean I should make her miserable.
My question is;  What is bothering me that makes me so angry at night.
Yes, I understand the concept of "Sun Downing".
But, there has to be more to it than the sun going down.
Tonight, and the last few nights, I have had overwhelming thoughts of my own death.
Now, death has not bothered me for decades.
I was a career Gunner's Mate in the Navy and a Gunner's Mater Tech Rep as a civilian for a while.
In that profession, you deal with the continuous proposition of death because of gun mounts blowing up, mechanical equipment killing you, electrocution, explosions of ammunition, and the normal dangers of going to sea on a combat vessel.
Yet, I see my LBD progressing from inside my being, and I know this will lead to my "going home".
Again, I am not afraid of death.
I am a born again believer and servant of the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords.
Jesus paid the price for me to enter Heaven.
Yet, my own death has been a constant companion for the last few days.
It could be the serious medical issues my Pastor friend and mentor in Virginia Beach has been going through that has my thoughts on this topic.
I am not sure.
But, the thought is in my mind in any case.
LBD is a lonely disease for me.
I suffer it in silence, alone, enduring the diminished menial capability that others do not notice.
Or, they say;  You look find.
I would not know you have LBD!
Then there is the recent increase in instability.
But, most don't notice.
Yet, I do, and it is constantly on my mind.
I forget words, things I wanted to remember to do, even where I am at times!!
Yet, I suffer alone.
Naps help.
I go to sleep early when I am so grumpy that I am bad company for my wife.
I mental fight the urge to scream at the thing that frustrate me.
But, the fight is alone.
So, every night I deal with my anger, frustration, and even depression.
No wonder I don't like evenings.

I had an appointment with my Psychologist this week.
Meeting with him is something I desperately need because it gives me a safe place to express why I feel and experience as I travel down the pond road of Lewy Body Dementia.
He and I can openly discuss anything that I need too.
He is a God send for me.
This Blog serves the same purpose!
Most of you do not know me, so I can write about any topic.
This anonymity protects my privacy, just as Doctor Patient privilege protects me with my Psychologist.
You profit because I write about topics that I would not openly discuss if you knew me.
Now, yes, some of you do know who I am.
You are best my friends and family.
But, you need to know about my journey also.
I trust you will not be embarrassed when I describe personal issues that are impacted by LBD.
There are numerous things that LBD impacts that most of you would never believe.
I have written about my occasional loss of bowel control and urinary control.
I have written about how REM Sleep disorder has caused me to punch my wife drink violent dreams.
I have written about my bodies inability to control m body temperature.
I have also written about my anger and rage issues.
But, I have never written about sexual dysfunction!
Yes, sexual ability is also impacted by LBD!
I never realized this, even though it is on the list of symptoms on the LBDA.org site.
Why?
I guess I psychologically skip those words!
No man wants to face the fact that he may not be able to perform sexually!
Men brag about the sexual capabilities.
Thy even embellish their sexual abilities.
Yes, I know that surprises some of you!
Right!!
But loss of sexual ability does cause depression and even anger.
Drugs do not work.
Why, because it is an issue caused in the brain, based on the effect of the Lewy Bodies effecting the brain.
This elite plaques that make portions of the brain fail.
Just like the part of my brain that no longer works to stop me from acting out my dreams when I sleep.
This tangles now have clogged the part o my brain that causes an erection.
Now, the effect is "on and off" right now.
Some days, I can perform and those are good days.
Most days, I cannot.
But that is the truth of LBD.
Some days are good days, yet, now, most are not.
So, we will continue this conversation.
Discussing issue cause by those plaques in my brain, and in the brain of your loved one.
Their problems, my problems, are not their fault.
They do not cause them.
Nor can they control them.
But, openly discussing these issues helps me deal with them, and I hope, helps you understand your loved one.
Thanks for being there.
I need each of you.

That's right!
Anything out of my routine causes me stress, tension, anger, physical pain, mental anguish, and depression.
If I planned to mow the lawn and I get diverted to an outing, my route is disrupted and I suffer from that disruption.
It is not the fault of the person who offered the change in my routine and it is not my fault.
It is an effect of LBD on my brain.
Right now, I can "Spotlight" and act happy, interested, normal, and even excited.
But when I get home, my neck hurts, I have a headache, I am agitated, angry, and completely out of sorts.
Soon, I will not be able to play the part of the happy camper and things will get worse.
My poor wife suffers the most because she has to be with my 24/7.
She has to watch me get angry and melt down.
I try not to, but I cannot control myself.
She is an amazing woman and I love her dearly.
I can only hope we will get into our Continuing Care Retirement Community soon.
There, I will be insulated from the outside world.
There, I can hide in familiar surroundings, safe from the disruptions that cause me this discomfort.
But for now, I can only wait.

<doc date=Friday, June 13, 2014>
Based on some of your comments, your answer for me might be; A longer time to complain!
And you may be right.
But, I did say I would write about all of the effects of LBD on me including the emotional issues!
But, there are many benefits in having an early Dx.
First of all is proper treatment!
I have read many posts on the LBDA.org community columns about individuals that were NOT receiving Namenda and Arecept early in their journey because the doctor failed to recognize LBD and diagnosed the patient with PD.
Second, and probably self-evident is the chance to get you affairs in order.
I have a friend who died suddenly.
Well, it was sudden to him.
He had three major heart attacks and two by-pass surgeries.
A Quad and a 5X.
Then, 5 years after his 5X by-pass, he had another heart attack, that killed him!
Since he never quit smoking, changed his diet, or gave up drinking, he should not have been surprised.
In any case, it took his widow a year to get everything in order.
His idea of a filing system was everything in or on the desk in no specific order!
Who pays the bills in your home?
Having you finances, will, power of attorney, living will, insurance beneficiary, who to contact when you die, the distribution of your IRA or 401k, all make your survivor's life easier.
There is also the issue of where you will spend eternity.
If you always meant to talk to that Pastor that always stops by to witness to you, NOW might be a good time!
Then there are life style changes that can and should be made.
For instance, if you live on 10 acres, 50 miles from a hospital, and you spouse never wanted to live that way, you might consider selling and moving closer to all the things she will need to care for you.
What about a Senior's Community with assisted living, memory support, and skilled nursing, co located with independent living apartments?
That would make your life, and your spouses life better when you really need help.
Then there is the issue of your job.
Can you retire on a disability?
If you can, and trust me, it is not all that hard, you may be blessed with a couple of goo years to enjoy with your spouse and family.
These years have been wonderful for us.
I am sure there are other good things that come from an early diagnosis.
And there are some negative things also.
For instance the stress, on you and your spouse, of having a degenerative mental and physical disease.
I have read blogs and postings on the LBDA website from caregivers who had lover ones die very quickly from LBD.
and an equal number of posts from caregivers that had their loved one live for 7, 10 even 15 years.
Now, all of those years were not good ones.
And that alone causes stress and worry.
But, LBD is an unpredictable, roller coaster ride for the patient and the caregiver.
My diagnosis came early and I retired when I could no longer do my job.
Getting away from the stress of my career has actually helped me physically and mentally.
But, the disease has progressed, slower than some, faster than others, in a very unpredictable manner.
I never know one day to the next, where I will be on the LBD journey.
For instance, my insomnia of the early years has returned!
My walking has slowed and became more unstable, and my long term memory has begun to suffer.
Yet, I still do very well, in my own way.
I enjoy life as I can, even away from my friends in Virginia.
Te bed part is being with my Wife.
Even when I am having issues, her company and love are a besting and better than any meds I take.
Early diagnosis is the key to successful, effective, treatment of LBD.
There is no cure.
But the is management of the disease in the early stages that serves to extend these early stages and thus, your quality of life.
LBD is a journey.
The long good bye.
An early diagnosis make this journey as easy as it can be.

In my previous post today, and one that I have not posted because it is too brutal, I lamented that I am away from my friends with nothing to do and no one to do it with!
This lack of social interaction is having a negative impact on my emotional health.
The Psychologist I see knows the and even tried to help with suggestions to m wife.
That did not help!
But the truth is, I miss the strong, deep, relationships I have back in Virginia.
My friends there are my family.
They are my support group.
I understand the draw of the Grandchildren for my wife.
But they are older teenagers and involved in their lives with their friends!
They see us seldom, and almost never have a worthwhile conversation with us.
No surprise, we are from different worlds!
So, the chance that we are going to influence them is somewhere between slim and none!
They are like most of today's kids, no plans, no initiative, and no motivation.
They want everything and will work for nothing!!
But, even writing this, is a waste and a frustration to me.
I am in Florida, like it or not, and this is where I will stay.
I need to take some advice from the Apostle Paul.
He said we should learn to be happy in whatever state we are in.
He said this after being in prison, shipwrecked on an island, bit by a poisonous snake, and being tried for things he was innocent of.
I need that level of faith.
So, I should be happy in the state of Florida!
I'll try.
That's the best I can do at this time.

Today, we toured Pensacola today.
The local historical society had an open house and historical reenacters all over the historical district of the city.
Then, the city also had a Hurricane Preparedness event on a town square that had different vendors and county agencies with Hurricane information.
It was a warm day and we enjoyed walking around, touring the historical venues, and the Hurricane preparedness displays for about 3 hours.
We at lunch in Downtown Pensacola at a quaint, local restaurant.
During that lunch, I began to feel mentally fuzzy.
I could not remember where we were or where we lived.
After a period of thought, I began to remember I lived fairly close to where we were but I had no idea how to get there.
This is not a new issue, but one that is normally in the background.
I don't think about it, so it does not bother me.
But, today, for some reason, it was an issue to me.
When I experience this mental disconnect, I am upset, and feel like I am lost, with no idea how to get where I belong, if I knew where that was.
As long as I am with my wife, I am OK.
I have had this feeling when I was up a night, alone in the living room, I feel lost.
My familiar surroundings help then.
Our hope is to get into a continuing care facility that I can progress in.
Our search continues.

I am down right drifty!!
I flit and flirt from topic to topic.
This is important and we must do it, then another issue pops up.
I am having continuing issues trying to find a place for us to live, when all I have to do is show a little patience until Azalea Trace is available.
One minute I want to move to the country, the next I want to move back to Virginia.
Then, I am looking at South Carolina!!
Of course, then the possibility of a room at the Armed Forces Retirement Home in Gulf Port Mississippi, comes up.
Get the idea!?!
Then, I walk around the house looking for things to do.
Dishes, toilets, lawn, floors.
Then I want to remodel, make the screened in porch a Florida room, and get a new high tech water heater, all before or after I go through  diatribe on why I never wanted to own a house!!
I am driving my poor wife crazy.
I know she is stressed out by my flighty demeanor.
I would love to stop being so annoying, but I really cannot control how I act.
My mind bounces around from idea to idea, without any filters or decisions!
I do the same thing on our future car purchase, life insurance, vacations, and many other topic areas.
I am sorry that I am so unfocused.
That being said, I cannot control it.
This illustrates the need, and possibly the requirement, for care giver breaks!!
She is with me 24/7/365!!
I don't like me now, how can she even stand me?
Yes, I know she loves me.
Yes, I know she will care for me always.
But, she needs a break from the constant droning of my crazy mind.
I am thinking the AFRH might be the best of all options.
But, I know I will change my mound in 5 minutes.
You should see me try to decide what to wear!

We were watching TV and a commercial was on from the VFW whining about 65 vets committing suicide everyday.
The Commander of the VFW said; We have to stop this!
My statement was WHY!
That's when I got in trouble.
So, I had to explain myself.
That did not go well either!
So, I am in trouble.
My explanation was that veterans are not respected, wanted or cared for in this nation.
So, who cares if we commit suicide?!
The VA debacle is just the tip of the iceberg.
The VA has been the place to go die for decades!!
The VA policy on granting disabilities is to delay, deny and watch them die!
The Politicians like us for photo ops, but nothing else.
No politician ever does anything about the treatment vet get!
The complain about the cost, want to reduce benefits, and hope we will die soon!!
So, if a vet decides to commit suicide, who cares.
We are doing the nation and the taxpayers a favor!
That's the attitude I see from our nations leaders!
You may disagree with me.
But the VA has denied and delayed my disability request, even though their own data connects the chemical in Mil-F-17111 Hydraulic Fluid to Dementia.
I was hyper-exposed to this hydraulic fluid for over 20 years.
I breathed it as a vapor from the 1500 psi hydraulic systems of the gun mounts I worked on.
Was doused in it from major hydraulic leaks, and got it in cuts and swallowed it!
I served on ships that had limited water making capabilities and often ant without showers for weeks at a time.
The longest I went without a shower was 30 days!
SO, there was no washing the chemical off.
We were NEVER cautioned to wear protective clothing or breathing apparatus.
We were NEVER given any special medical treatment or training.
There are thousands of Gunner's Mates out there suffering from this toxin.
Without VA help.
Who cares if we die!
So, I am in trouble!
Oh well.
I have been there before.

Many of you know I write a blog about my Navy career.
You may also know that I spend most of my time thinking and dreaming about my Nay career.
It seems I am still in the Navy.
But, recently I have noticed that my more detailed memories of the Navy are missing!
One point you need to know is that I used to have near total recall.
It I read something, or was told something, I remembered it, verbatim, forever!
The electronic and hydraulic diagrams for the Gun Mounts I worked on were mostly in my mind.
Yes, I consulted the diagrams when I was troubleshooting an issue, but it as more to make sure than to search for the issue.
Yesterday evening, we were driving back from a shopping trip and a young friend asked me why the Navy stopped using armor on it's ships?
I told him I did not know.
My wife then said it was because of the shift from Battleships to Aircraft Carriers during World War Two!
Of course, she was right, she had heard me explain this fact many times and she remembered.
She helped me out, but I was completely dumbfounded and without a reason.
That fact was no longer in my mind.
This has happened on different issues recently and I now realize my long term memory is being impacted by the Lewy Bodies.
It is just one more sign that my LBD has progressed to a new level.
As it used to be said; "No brag, just fact!"
But, it is frightening to recognize that I am loosing what I cling too.

I wrote a few days ago about how good I felt after my surgery.
I also said, I wondered how long it would last.
I found out the answer to that question.
Today, I felt the vitality, memory capability, and energy drain out of my body.
We have been busy, for us, the last few days.
Today, we went to some friends home for dinner.
It was a wonderful evening.
All of us had things in common and we exchanged stories of our childhood, careers, and Church experiences.
Oh, he and I were both career Navy Enlisted men, so we each had some sea stories to tell also.
It was a great time.
The meal was exquisite!
I had a wonderful time.
But, my wife noticed me slipping and told me it was time to go.
I did not want to leave because I was having such a great time.
But, she knew what was best.
By the time we got in the car, I was slapping my leg and tapping my fingers in that annoying way.
I was spent, and I am now.
I knew earlier today that I was slipping and took a short nap to try to recapture what I had the last few days.
It did not work.
I am back where I was before the surgery.
That is the frustrating part of LBD.
The UP and down of the disease.
For a minute, or really a couple of days, I felt like I was "Normal".
I had my thoughts of building my Concrete Survival Home again!
I even looked up land in South Dakota.
But, reality sat in and I am back to understanding I will never get better and I will only get worse.
I have said before, I wish I never had these times of feeling better.
Status Quo would be much better for my mental well being.
Lewy Body is cruel that way.
But, you already know that.
It is only those of us with the disease that suffer from the ups and downs.
Oh, well, it was the BEST evening we have had since we moved to Florida!!
That was worth it!

It is now a week since my hernia repair.
I feel great!
I am still a little tender in the surgery area but nothing big.
You may remember they used a local to do the surgery to preclude the mental decline from General Anesthesia that elderly dementia patients often experience.
But the interesting thing is, I am actually better off mentally after the surgery than I was before.
I am mentally sharper and I seem to be "Up" a notch from my pre-surgery mental position!!
My question is, what did they put in that IV to place me in a "Dream Like" state during the surgery?
I certainly woke up clear headed and alert!
If it works on other dementia patients like it did on me, all of us should get a dose of this drug.
On a related note, my left shoulder needs a rotator cuff repair and I have had that on hold because of the requirement for General Anesthesia.
The surgeon that did my hernia repair gave me the name of a Orthopedic Surgeon that does shoulder surgery with local anesthesia!
I believe, as soon as I am 100% for the hernia repair, I am going to call him!
One more dose of that Nap Time Drug and I will be good as new!
The question is, how long doe it work.
No matter, it is working now and I love it!

<doc date=Friday, May 16, 2014>
This is my second day of recovery and I am doing quite well.
Well enough that I can review the surgery with a keen eye.
First;  It is a little unnerving to look at this 6 inch long incision closed by super glue!
No stitches, no staples, no butterflies!
Not even a bandade!
Just a  1/8  inch wide strip of glue very close to part of my body few people have seen!
I hope it holds.
Second;  I had to WALK into the operating room!
That was a first.
A rotator cuff surgery, two other hernias, and colon surgery, and I never had to walk to the surgery room!
I guess that is a budget saving move.
Third;  The pharmacy delivered the take home drugs to us before we left the hospital!
Now that is customer service.
Fourth; I am still numb in the area close to the incision!
Inside is a little painful, but the outside, where the glue is, is numb!
This has been a good experience but I plan on making it my last planned surgery!
I will evaluate emergencies as they happen but I am done doing this if there is a choice!
I still have a sense or humor.
</doc>
<doc date=Thursday, May 15, 2014>
The surgery was yesterday at 9 AM.
I can say this was the easiest hernia repair of the three.
I left the hospital almost spin free because to the new procedure of numbing the surgery site from the inside.
I did not take any pain meds until last evening.
I got some uninterrupted sleep and I continue to take the pain media at a 25% reduction from the max permitted.
Did I tell you I don't like pain meds?!
But, they are necessary sometimes.
The surgeon was good.
The anesthesiologist put me into a nap state, and all went well.
I woke up alert.
Early this morning, about 4AM, I did have a short episode of nausea, that diarrhea feeling up my back, and a cold, clammy, sweat over my body.
I drank some Ginger Ale slowly, and in about a half hour I felt better.
That's it!
Now, I am still sore, but the pain is manageable.
I will continue to take it slow for the rest of the week and I WILL NOT lift anything heavier than my coffee cup for the next 6 weeks!
But I feel pretty good.
I appreciate everyone prayers and telephone calls.
Your friendship and caring keep me going strong.
I will keep you posted.
But right now, it is time to rest.
</doc>
<doc date=Tuesday, May 13, 2014>
OK, this came fast!
Tomorrow morning is my hernia repair surgery.
I am ready.
As ready as I ever am for surgery.
It is supposed to be outpatient surgery and the only this that will change that is a complication, dementia issues, or extreme pain.
My other two hernia repairs were anything but painless.
As a matter of fact, I have said many times that I would rather have the remainder of my colon removed than have another hernia repair.
But, hernia repay it is.
This is going to be a little different in that using General Anesthesia on dementia patients is not advised.
It seems we wake up in a different time zone.
So, this hernia will be repaired with local anesthesia.
Now, I had all four of my wisdom teeth removed with local anesthesia and it did not hurt.
So, I am encouraged.
Everything is relative.
This surgery is less than the removal of one-half of my colon and they are using the same anesthesia as the oral surgeon see to remove my wisdom teeth.
No sweat!
And, being a dementia patient, I have a secret weapon.
I will forget the pain in a few hours!
There are benefits to having Lewy Body Dementia.
There were two things I had to do in preparation for this surgery.
First, I had to re-write my "Just in Case" letter.
Everyone should have a letter explaining where the money is, the insurance policies, your burial wishes, and how to close out your affairs.
It is a military thing because we tend to die early and often.
But, I had not changed the letter since we moved to Florida.
In fact, I had not re-wrote the letter since 2006!
Second, I had to shave my beard off!
Why?
I did not want the anesthesiologist to have to deal with hair if they had to incubate me.
When I had my wisdom teeth removed, the oral surgeon lost the sutcher material in my gray beard!
So, bald face, I approach surgery again.
I am not worried and I don't think Linda will need to open that letter just yet.
I expect to be home tomorrow afternoon with a new scar to show off.
Nothing more than that.

Since the flood, we have received so much support from our family and friends.
It is interesting how much support and relief a telephone call or email provide.
For instance, my friend from work, Steve, called Tuesday.
He could tell I was upset and having mental issues.
He asked to speak with my wife, using "Library reference question" as a cover.
He then set up a Skype call for Wednesday morning, my Birthday, with the guys I worked with!!
It was priceless to me and It helped me get on a even keel.
I have received cards and emails from Navy friends, Church friends and family.
I had a Facebook post from a friend I used to work with.
Keith told me, anything we needed or if we needed help, he would be here.
Just ask!!
Then, there is my best friend Jerry.
He sent help to our son!
Jerry did this because we are family!
I called Jerry ad thanked him but that is not sufficient for such an act of love and caring.
I still tear up when I think of his charity.
He is truly a friend indeed.
Tragedy and disaster bring out true friends and their charity and love.
We have been blessed with the best friends any family could have.
Thank you from the bottom of my heart.

This disaster has shown me how much of me LBD has taken.
All my life, I was tyne man people came to when things got bad.
When I was in the Navy, and a Gunner's Mate, I dealt with extremely dangerous situations.
I was always calm, in charge, and precise in what I did and what I directed others to do.
Now, I am unable to do anything!
I find myself angry, frightened, and wanting to run away.
I sleep almost all of the time and even then I do not escape my disease.
I dream of being lost, most in my mind, and unable to find my way home.
No one around me understands what I am going through.
They all see my anger but do not understand my emotions.
My routine is completely disrupted.
My wife is trying to restore my routine but she is more dedicated to helping the family and I totally understand that.
She is doing what I used to do.
Good for her.
I am proud of her and angry at myself.
My wife gets angry at my outbursts and my sleeping.
I am a frustration to her and a liability to everyone around me.
Truthfully, I do not know what to do or where to turn.
I am sorry that I am causing my family problems in their time of need.
I truly do not know hat to do or where to turn.
LBD has stripped me of who I was.
This is the new norm and I don't like it.
</doc>
<doc date=Saturday, May 3, 2014>
We live in the Pensacola area and we have had a very wet winter and spring.
It was topped off by 24+ inches of rain in less that 48 hours.
Our home remained dry but our son's home flooded 4 feet deep at 4 AM!
They literally had to swim out and carry their pets with them.
Cats and Bulldogs don't swim well!
They have lost everything and while their insurance company has totaled both of their cars, their household goods is another thing.
The insurance company is waffling on the coverage decision.
Again, they lost everything.
We have been doing all we can to help, but with a hernia and the effects of LBD, I am pretty much useless.
But the ravages of LBD are the hardest for me and my wife to deal with.
I am either very grumpy and griping very loudly about anything I don't agree with or I am brooding in the corner.
The disruption to my routine is the culprit.
My wife is working hard to preserve memories for my son's family.
WE presently have hundreds of photos hanging in out garage, drying!
Scrap books, report cards, mementos, anything that was squirreled away to remember that special time.
Now all wet, soaked, and in danger of disintegrating.
I am not doing well right now and that is a problem for my wife.
But there is little or nothing I can do about it.
I have a short range view of life.
So my view of photos and mementos squirreled away and left to rot are not as important to me as their are to her.
Or, it could just be a female thing!!
I remember a joke I heard once.
A man walking on the beach, finds a metal lantern.
He rubs it and a Genie appears.
The Genie tells the man he has one wish!!
SO, the man says;  I want to go to Hawaii and I am afraid to fly or take a cruise.
So, I want you to build a bridge to Hawaii!
The Genie screams;  Do you know how far it its to Hawaii from San Diego?
Do you know how deep the Pacific Ocean is there?
Do you have any idea how much concrete it would take?
No, make another wish.
So, the man says;  Well, I always wanted to know how women think,  You know, how their minds work!
The Genie replies;  So, how many lanes do you want that bridge to be?!!
That is my point.
I don't think like females.
And that is where I get in trouble.
That and my social filters and tact are shot!!
SO, I guess I will try to just do what I am told and keep my opinions to myself! 
</doc>
<doc date=Friday, May 2, 2014>
OK, here we go.
My hernia surgery is scheduled for 14 May.
Yes, that is quick, but they had an opening and I thought I better get it done before I change my mind!
Why?
Because the idea of hernia surgery and being awake is not on my list of things I want to do.
Yes, it is better for my LBD.
And it greatly reduces the known impact on my cognitive outlook.
But, think of it, your groin being cut open, while you are on the same pain meds the Dentist uses!!
Now, the surgeon did say he would have the gas passes give me some meds to relax me!
Relax!?
He had better get me blown out of my mind!
I better be so relaxed they I don't care he is cutting on my groin with a very sharp knife!
It is also curious why scope surgery cannot be done with  local and full blown, open body, surgery can be!!
Oh well.
The hernia needs to be repaired and the surgeon assured me this would work.
So, I trust him.
He had a kind face.
</doc>
<doc date=Thursday, May 1, 2014>
OK, I went to the surgeon today.
I was immediately comfortable with him.
He was up to date on the impact of General Anesthesia on Lewy Body Dementia patients and offered me two alternatives.
One;  No surgery and I will never lift anything heavy again.
My wife immediately said; "That won't work!!"
The second alternative was to do the surgery with a traditional incision and use local anesthetic.
The third was to do laproscopic surgery with General Anesthesia.
But that was ruled out because of the negative effects of putting me to sleep.
He assured me the Anesthesiologist would choose drugs to relax me that would have the least impact on my disease.
So, it looks like I am going to have my third hernia repaired.
The Surgeon also told me he could assure me I would not blow this one out!
I advise him not to bet on that one!!
I came away feeling sure of his abilities and his dedication to my well being.
The thing that made me feel the best was he was a student of Naval Gunnery!
I don't know why, but he was very interested in my career.
I told him we used to make beer can bazookas that shot tennis balls!
He asked me why propellant we used?
Lighter Fluid, I said!!
Now, I am committed to making him one!!
Sounds like fun!!
One more point.
When is the surgery.
It has not been scheduled yet.
But, I believe it will be soon.
I will keep you posted.

I am 63 years old.
I have fond memories of each summer when my Grandmother came from Florida to visit.
Se stayed with us and she was fun.
She played piano for silent movies in her past and was also a Vaudeville entertainer.
We had an old upright piano and she would play the old songs.
Al Jolson and Eddie Cantor songs.
And those songs, including all of the words, still run in my memory!
While my mind can no longer see a future, it lives in the past.
I can see that house on Puritas Road in Cleveland.
My Mom and Dads bedroom off the living room, where the piano was.
My Grandma Lane, her white hair cut short, playing the piano, while her left food bounced to keep time!
Those songs are precious to me just like those memories.
Grandma Lane was the lady who most influenced me to seek Christ!
She was a prayer warrior and a staunch believer in the Gospel.
Yes, she rolled her own cigarettes.
But, everyone has some faults!
I loved her.
Old music runs through my mind constantly.
It keeps me company and soothes my anger.
I sing it quietly to myself.
Jolson, George Jones, even Martial Music (military tunes).
I still remember my Junior High School song!!
I do not like any of the new music.
Not even the modern praise music sung in some churches today!
If it is after Bill Gaither, I don't like it!!
I have a friend back at our home Church that says the modern praise music is 7/11 music!
That's seven verses sung eleven times!!
I agree!!
It is said, music soothes the savage beast.
I my case, that is true.
More old music please.

<doc date=Monday, April 28, 2014>
I truly wish I could look into my brain and see where the tangles of Lewy Body are effecting me.
Why, because for the last couple of weeks, rage and anger have been washing over me in increasing amounts and times!
I am still able to control it and I did make my neurologist aware of this development.
He told my wife to let him know if anything got worse or changed.
She has not called him yet.
One way I deal with this rage and anger is to go to bed.
The solitude and isolation help me cope and reduce the emotions I feel.
Quiet, dark, alone, no interaction with anyone.
Just me and the poodles.
It works for now and I hope it continues to help.
I am trying very hard to avoid taking any medicines for this condition since I know they will have a negative impact on my awareness.
And I take so many drugs now, that I really am reticent to add anything to my regimen.
We know that emotional outbursts are part of LBD.
That does not make it any easier on Linda.
The rage and anger make me feel bad after the episode, even if I say noting that upsets her.
Keeping these emotions in is just as bad for me as an outburst is for her.
I can see where placing me in a facility, separate from her, might be good for her.
I must say I am not looking forward to that, but I know it is coming.
Again, our hope is that the CCRC will become available before I absolutely require professional care.
I guess I am not a candidate yet.
Since I can still discuss the topic without emotion.
So, another LBD issue increases and becomes a driver instead of a side issue.
What next?

<doc date=Friday, April 25, 2014>
It is almost midnight and I was sitting here in my recliner.
thinking about the past, as I do most times.
I was reminiscing about a recent Skype telephone call I had with the group of managers I used to work with.
My friend, Steve had set up this call to reconnect me with the guys I worked with.
They were out for a birthday lunch, a tradition our Boss, Alan, had set up.
I enjoy seeing and talking with the people that I went through so much with.
The connection is good for me.
During that call, I asked my Alan if he was ready to have me back?
He really did not want me to retire and tried very hard to help me continue to work.
But, I knew it was time to retire and he helped me do just that.
The question that came into my mind was, Why did I ask Alan if I could come back?
The answer to that is difficult to face for me.
The answer is, I felt important, useful, and needed, when I worked for the Navy.
None of those qualities exist in my life now.
I had technical experience and knowledge.
I was one of the managers that had done just about everything.
I had a Navy background in Uniform and as a Civil Servant.
I briefed Congressmen, Senators, the CNO, Secretary of the Navy, and more Admirals than I care to remember.
I was unflappable and bulletproof, at least in my own mind.
Now, I am neither bulletproof or valuable.
That is hard for me to deal with.
As the degradation of my mental and physical capabilities continues, little things remind me that I am decreasing.
For instance, when I have a bowel accident, I realize how little I am in control of now.
This is tough for me to deal with.
Today has been a day filled with reality and I always try to bring that reality to those of you who read my blog.
Not to make you sad or to evoke sympathy.
But to convey the emotions and thoughts that I am going through.
LBD is a tough journey that tests my morale and faith.
I will not be defeated.
But I am sure there are a few more hits before the fight is over.
For Steve;  You are a great friend and I have watched you show compassion to many people for a long time.
I appreciate what you have done and continue to do for me.
Thanks Pal!

It is time to take inventory of where I am mentally.
I have written recently about the changes in my mental condition but I have not really told you exactly what has changed.
So, here goes.
First, my memory has degraded and I have difficulty recalling important facts required for living.
For instance, my address, zip code, telephone number, and the names of the medicines I take and for what.
Second, I cannot regulate my body temperature.
That is an autonomic function and one that is now being effected by LBD.
Another autonomic function that is being impacted is bowel and urine control.
Enough said there.
Third, when I ride in the car, speed is amplified and distances are much shorter between the car in front of us.
I yell for my wife to slow down and stop or back off from the car in front of us.
My eyesight is being impacted by the LBD.
Fourth, I cannot translate written instructions, like a cooking recipe, into physical actions.
I simply cannot comprehend what I read.
Additionally, I have noticed some physical issues increasing.
For instance, at night, when I first lay down, my body convulses.
I violently shake from head to toe a couple of times before my body relaxes.
Also, my stability walking is getting worse and my legs hurt constantly.
I am weaker and I have very little energy.
So, there is progression there too.
Naturally, I have problems holding meaningful conversations and I have difficulties finding the word I want to use.
This is more prevalent in the evening.
My mind spends most of the time in the past.
I often tell stories about my Navy past whenever I get into a conversation.
Also, I get frustrated and angry when people do not want to listen to my stories.
These are normal changes for the state of my disease.
If you are new to LBD, this gives you an idea where your loved one is headed.
If you are my friend or family member, if you want a meaningful conversation or information from me, you better act quick.
It seems the strength of Lewy Body Dementia is overwhelming the effectiveness of the meds.
One other issue.
My wife has noticed that when she says something to me,  I say "What" immediately.
It is not that I can't hear her, it is that I am processing what she says and I have the need to reply to her immediately, even though I mentally have not processed what she said.
Again, my brain can't process things very fast and this is my defensive reaction to that slowness.

Have you ever woke up from a nap and everything seemed far away?
The voices you heard were distant and everything you saw seemed distant of as if you were looking through a tube?
I feel that way most of the time now.
It is the newest evidence that the journey is increasing in intensity.
It is somewhat frustrating because I feel so disoriented.
I especially get this feeling in crowds like I described yesterday at church.
In crowds the "Distant" feeling makes me anxious and fearful.
It is as if my sensors are maxed out!
I also have this effect when riding in the car.
For instance, when my wife is approaching a vehicle from behind, the car seems to approach us much faster than she sees it.
I start to yell for her to stop!
She handles it well, but I bet it is aggravating for her.
When I drive, yes, I still drive but not alone, I stop much farther back than she does or I probably used too.
I suspect that frustrates my wife and the other drivers on the road.
I guess it is my turn to aggravate other drivers!!
All of these issues point to progression.
I just hope the progression does not keep me out of a place to live.
Both the Navy Home and Azalea Trace require me to be a "Full Up Round" by their evaluation at my entrance.
We have decided that we will move me into either one that opens up first.
My last communications with the Navy Home administrator stated that I should expect a room in November of this year.
We have no indication on Azalea Trace.
So, we will see.
We always knew this was progressive disease.
We have have experienced a slow progression up to now, so I have nothing to complain about.
And, as my friend, the In Service Engineering Agent for the Diesel Engines on the U.S. Navy Mine Sweepers, Betsy Walsh, says;  It will be what it will be!

We had a wonderful morning at Church today.
Easter Sunday is always an uplifting day.
The reassurance that our Savior, paid, in full, the entire cost to purchase our freedom from the penalty of our sins lifts my spirits and calms my soul.
We had a breakfast at the Church before Sunday Services.
I still think it is strange that we do not have a Son Rise service first, then the breakfast, and then, Resurrection Sunday Church Services.
But, maybe I am old fashion.
The large crowd at church overwhelmed me.
There are too many people talking, moving, interacting, children running around, crying, food smells, and furniture in different places.
It is sensory overload for me.
As my wife drove home, I told her I was not doing well and she told me she understood.
She was talking with a lady before we left the church and my disease came up as a topic along with our possible move to the Continuing Care Retirement Community.
As she told me about that conversation, I broke in and told her;  "They better hurry and get me in soon or I won't qualify!"
She told me she knew that.
It is true, I wrote before that I was experiencing an acceleration in my rate of decline.
I see my decline more and more each day.
My lack of ability to translate directions into actions.
Lost thoughts, lost words and a general decline in my conversation skills.
More dreams, REM sleep disorder issues, and some other issues.
I really have no complaints and if I become catatonic tomorrow, I have had a wonderful life and up to now, my experience with LBD has been gentle and slow.
I have no right to ask God for an easy decline.
I only ask for his grace and mercy.
My mind wanders and I get lost in memories.
I make plans I know will never come to pass and then forget them.
Little seems to be important to me anymore.
I do not want to go anywhere or do anything.
I sleep in the afternoon and stay up most of the night.
I get the names of my son and grandsons wrong.
I am confused more that not.
But, I know my ticket to Heaven is bought, by Jesus.
Nothing else matters.

Most people know  have Lewy Body Dementia.
Why, because, besides the Navy, it is the second most thing I talk about.
Why, because it dominates my thoughts and life.
Now, most people that I come in contact with me care very little about my disease or my Navy career.
But, they do treat me in a very curious manner when I have contact with them.
For instance, today we helped set up at the Church we attend, for tomorrow's Easter breakfast before Easter Service.
It seems strange to me the have a breakfast but no Sonrise Service!
But, who am I?
In any case, the Pastor of the Church was there and I helped him put out some books for folks to take about Easter.
He commented on the water proof wrapping of each book and I remembered a story told to me by a Missionary that was part of the underground that smuggled Bibles behind the Iron Curtain.
The Pastor looked at me like I had two heads!
Now, I admit I do have a lot of stories to tell.
Most are true.
But, I honestly do not understand why my relaying a story about smuggling Bibles to Christians in East Germany is weird when the Pastor was just carping about hermetically sealed, single book packaging!
Seems to me, if I were smuggling Bibles behind the Iron Curtain, I would want them hermetically sealed!!
But, he did not see the connection, obviously, and I was judged to be crazy!
Maybe he is right.
But people assume I am normal and that nothing is wrong with me, and then act repulsed when I do not act like they think I should!
I am doing the best I have and I think I am doing fairly well, all things considered.
I now understand how other mentally challenged people feel.
My brain works different now.
That is not my fault.
If they know I have LBD, they should be more understanding.
How I long to be back in Virginia, with my Church friends and Navy Buddies.
They have been with me from the start of this journey.
They understand me,  They live me.
For me, this move was a bad idea.

I experienced something recently that upsets me.
I realized that I am isolated, completely!
As you know I live in the memories of my past.
Those memories are of my Navy career.
I love the Navy and I am proud of what I accomplished in the Navy and as a Civil Servant working for the Navy.
But, no one around me wants to hear about my memories or even respects them.
Instead, I was told, in so many words, to stop talking about the Navy.
I am, or better yet, who I am or was, is isolated, alone, and without any friendly contact.
I might as well be on a deserted island, alone.
Most of the conversations I have are with myself or with my friends in my memories.
While I thought the move to Florida might be a good idea, it is anything but that for me.
The overall, total, rejection of me is  more than I can bear and it is driving me further into isolation.
I remember a happy day in the past, when my Shipmate, Chuck Morton, surprised me by knocking on my apartment door in Virginia Beach.
Seeing him, talking with him, remembering our experiences together and the men we served with, was like medicine to my condition.
Yes, Shipmates call me and yes, I talk to Jerry every week.
Those calls keep me sane.
But, happy is not on the horizon.
With the exception of puking after getting drunk, I have never spent so much time and money being miserable that now.
Further more, I really do not think anyone gives a darn.
Without dementia, maybe I could adjust to my new surroundings, make friends, find something to do.
But, my mind is constantly in the Navy and those experiences related to the Navy.
And, no one either cares or wants to hear about my Navy experience.
I once said this area was very unfriendly.
Now I know it is me.
I am alone, in a sea of people, that don't speak my language and cannot see me.
Invisible and unheard.
In total isolation.
Even my wife cringes when I start to discuss Navy experiences.
But, maybe she has heard them all ten times before.

This morning, I woke up at 0830.
Got up, and went to take my thyroid medication like normal.
A few minutes later I discovered that I had taken Marcel's thyroid medication again!
This is now a pattern and not an isolated incident.
So, now my wife will take over administering the Dog's medicines.
The pills re not the real issue.
My recent loss of my ability to organize actions is.
This loss denotes a plateau drop in my mental functioning.
With my pending surgery, that drop is not welcomed.
I have noticed mt inability to organize my thoughts and actions is a threat to my independence.
Yes, I knew it was coming and intact, I have had a longer period of good mental functions than I should have.
That is because of my neurologist in Virginia.
But now, either the meds have lost their effectiveness or most likely, the Lewy Bodies have taken over more of my brain, tangling up my executive function.
So, I will have to concentrate on doing one thing at a time.
QIth my Wife's help, I will be OK for a while.

A few days ago, I felt a familiar pain in the left side of my groin.
I made a doctor's appointment and today was the day.
My doctor performed the usual manual check; "Turn your ear to the left and cough"  And the results ere as I expected.
I am the proud owner of a new hernia!!
It is not my first hernia.
I had a large hernia on the right side a number of years ago, before my LBD diagnosis.
That hernia was repaired TWICE!
Yes, I blew out the repair job.
I asked the surgeon if he guaranteed his work, but he said I had exceeded the warranty conditions.
The last hernia, the blow out, I remember doing.
I was lifting book boxes during a move.
The first hernia I never knew I had.
No pain no indication until my doctor did a physical on me and did the normal male check.
This one is a surprise too.
Now, I will be totally honest.
As a Navy Gunner's Mate, I abused my body for the better part of 20 years and then ten years of my Civil Service career.
So, it is no surprise that parts of my muscle and bone structure are worn out.
I tore the rotator cuffing my right shoulder and had it repaired and now the left shoulder is torn and needs repair.
I was rode hard and put up wet!!
Of course, the concern is being placed under general anesthesia with LBD.
As I have been told by my neurologist and GP in Virginia, chances are I will not wake up in the same Zip zone and possibly not in the time zone!
But, since coughing causes some severe pain, this thing has to be repaired!
I can live with the left shoulder pain, but not the hernia.
But wait, since I am gong to chance General Anesthesia for the hernia, maybe I can talk the shoulder surgeon into working on my left shoulder at the same time!
It will save the insurance companies and Medicare some big bucks since I will already be in the hospital and asleep!!
I need to look into that one.
This is just another challenge in life.
Not a big deal, although the worst pain I have ever had was related to BOTH hernia operations!!
So, I hope pain meds have improved!!
I will keep you posted, if I wake up in the same time zone.
If not, it won't matter.
I pretty much live in my own world anyway, most of the time.

Yesterday, I had my second visit with a Psychologist.
I continue to be impressed with his caring nature and interest in my well being.
He is easy to read!
Every time i say something he finds interesting or maybe even identifying a problem, he begins to write copious notes!!
Scribble, scribble, scribble, while never missing a thought I am discussion or any body language I may be transmitting.
We discussed at length, how I deal with the impact of LBD.
One of the things I told him, that caused much scribbling, was my view of the future.
While my wife is still very concerned about the future.
I can not even see a future!
I used to be very involved in future planning.
I had savings plans, next promotion plans, retirement plans, trip plans, next car plans, next house plans, I had a plan for everything that could possibly happen in the future.
I continued that planning through the early part of my disease, as if I was going to beat this or even be told they made a mistake.
Now I know, neither is true and I can no longer see even tomorrow!
I know this is a frustration to my wife, but it is where I am.
Another thing we discussed at length is my worries about being accepted into a Continuing Care Retirement Community.
These communities want new residents to be fully functioning when they move in.
The longer we have to wait for an apartment at Azalea Trace, the more remote the possibility that I will be accepted!
He encouraged me to cons idea a community close to us in Spanish Fort, Alabama.
I told him that facility was too far away from our now comfortable footprint of doctors, Bible studies, and family.
So, my frustration and anxiety continues.
Just the same, it is good to have an outsider to confide in and discuss issues that are bothering me without having to consider the feelings of the person I am talking with!
I don't have to carefully pick my words with him.
The last topic we discussed came with homework for me!
I told him I now felt I was in decline and possibly the last decline.
The final, slow, good bye.
He did not judge my statement or try to reason with me.
But he did ask me to provide him reason, feelings, noticed declines in physical or mental ability, on our next visit.
I have already started my list.
Again, this is good, since he did not try to talk me back to "Normalcy".
He just wanted me to document my feelings.
After two visits, three house of counseling, I can say emphatically, that this is good for me!
I do have on wee question I need to ask him.
Since he is from Alabama,  wonder if he is related to the famous NASCAR racing family, since his last name is Yarborough!

<doc date=Thursday, April 3, 2014>
I have written recently about the progression of my LBD.
Recently, I have been experiencing more intense and often mental confusion.
Additionally, I am more withdrawn and I seem to love in my thoughts instead of the world around me.
I am actually repulsed by life!
I find myself standing in a room not knowing why I am standing.
Doing anything that causes me to go out of the house is a chore at best and repulsive most of the time.
Linda and I lead a Bible Study at a local Assisted Living Facility.
I love the people there and we are always welcomed and treated with love and respect by the residents and the staff.
But getting ready to go, studying the lesson, and preparing to lead the Bible Study, is like pulling teeth!
Once we are there, I enjoy myself.
This confusion and cognitive fog is more oppressive than ever before and I feel that no one noticed my issues, or cares about my well being.
I am writing from my emotional base right now.
Logically, I know my wife cares deeply for me.
Yet, getting constantly corrected for simple things adds to my dismay.
The other day, I got yelled at for sitting in her new chair, which is unused and sitting in her unused office!
I will never touch that chair again!
I have asked to go to a once a week event provided by the Alzheimer's Association that is directed at those with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI).
I know I am a bit past that, but I think it would be good for me to interact with those who suffer similar issues as me.
It has not met with support.
My recliner is my place to slide into my mental world of relaxation and security.
While the television is normally on, I only watch a few shows a week.
Other than that I am either on the Internet looking at the diminishing list of things that interest me, or I am deep in thought about my past and friends that I miss.
I actually view the fog and confusion as my friends.
The help me escape from a world I no longer like!

This blog was originally established to help me and to leave a legacy to my friends and family.
But it has grown into much more.
Through the emails and comments of those who read these posts, I have received countless blessings and strength.
Many of you who write to me are caregivers for dementia and LBD patients.
Husbands, mothers, fathers, wives, all connected through this blog.
I truly cherish every communication I receive from each of you.
You have helped me through difficult times and even kicked me in the seat of the pants when I needed exactly that!
Like family, you seem to know when I need encouragement, kindness, and counseling.
While I never thought I would be involved in an endeavor as important as this, I cling to each post, each reply, and each email, connected to this blog.
I used to complain that there was no support group for LBD.
That no longer is true.
You are my support group and I strive to be part of yours.
Some of you are farther down the path of LBD than I am.
I learn from each of you.
Some of you are new to this challenging journey.
I hope we as a community can be an assistance to you.
I also bring your attention the LBDA.Org site and the blog "Lifeafterlewy.blogspot.org" Both of these sites offer great information and insight.
I learn from both of them daily.
As many of you know, my condition has taken another downward turn.
Taking the dog's thyroid medicine was an indicator.
So has me looking for my cell phone all day today.
It seems the dog's pill did not help me track things!
I have learned that it is good to laugh at how Lewy impacts you.
Another issues I have written about lately is our search for a continuing care community.
It is fantasy to think I am the only one that will need special care.
My wife has a strong genetic link to Alzheimer's and she was exposed to the same chemicals I was in the Navy because I brought my dirty uniforms and work clothes home to be washed when I was not deployed!
There is also brown hips and osteoporosis.
What would I do if she was in a nursing home and I was left at home alone?!
I don't even know what meds I take!
Obviously!!
So a community that provides for both of us is paramount.
But the community we want has a waiting list as long as Interstate 10!
We have continued our search without results.
But, God will provide.
My Pastor's wife at Grace Community Church in Virginia Beach says;  "God has taken god care of me this far, I have no reason to think he will let me down now."
Sound logic to live by and I will.
So, let's keep in touch, supporting each other, and keeping everyone informed on how we are doing.
We will all be better because of our working together.

I wrote earlier today about my mistakenly taking my poodle's levothyroxine.
That mishap has lead to a very stressful and depressing day.
This is the day, that the reality of LBD hit me like a ton of bricks!
Today is the first time I actually had the emotion; "Why me?"
Now before you write me and give me a lecture on "Why me?
", let me help you.
I know God chose me to have LBD before I was formed in my Mother's womb.
He also chose me to be born out of wedlock, raised by loving people not related to me, and to become the youngest Master Chief in the history of the Navy.
I know it is God's perfect plan.
That being said, I still am presently overwhelmed with the "Why me?"
emotion.
Today we also started to fill out the financial questionnaire for Azalea Trace, a continuing care facility in Pensacola.
That has left me feeling like we do not have enough money coming in to cover the cost of living there.
Even though we were assured we would.
The fact is, we may not.
It remains to be seen.
That would leave me in the Armed Forces Retirement Home and my wife in an undetermined location and care.
This was not a good day.
The stress of trying to prudently plan for our future, has left me depressed.
Even though we saved and lived below our means for most of our married life, we may have missed the mark.
That had added tons of stress and emotion to our lives.
The recent down turn in my disease has illuminated a number of issues that we did not adequately address.
Maybe we were in denial.
But we certainly are not now.

I have been having problems with my eye sight the last few months.
Yesterday, my son and I went out to test drive some cars for him.
Since I am a car nut, I am always up for a car shopping trip.
He drove the cars and I rode.
He drives like I used too, fast.
When he did, I reacted like Mr. Magoo's Mom!
Going fast seems to make everything seem to be crashing in on me all at once.
Frightening!!
I think I shocked my son with my exaggerated reaction to going fast.
But, it is what it is.
I also notice that I have difficulty seeing small thinks.
For instance, I now have to wear my glasses to shave!
That caused me to from my goatee back.
That way I do n to have the close shaving issues.
Just wide open face and neck on either side!
Much like other things here in the Panhandle of Florida, the last eye doctor I went to was a moron with the customer service skills of a mass murderer!!
So, I am not going to go to another eye doctor here.
Therefore, I will just have to deal with my vision issues.
I did purchase a big magnifying glass to help me see things.
That is better than getting treated like a freak!
When someone tells you Florida is god for retirees.
Or Florida knows how to deal with retirees.
Punch them in the nose!
The Panhandle of Florida, or East Lower Alabama or "East LA" as I like to refer to this hick infested backwoods hell hole, has no capability of helping or dealing with retirees or anyone with a disease more complicated than a hangover.
Oh well, as a friend of mine who is the In Service Engineer for the MCM Diesel engines says; "It is what it is."
I can't change it and I am too tired to try.

<doc date=Tuesday, March 18, 2014>
My last post generated some comments that I appreciate.
It is always good to have someone give you a gentle, caring, kick in the seat of the pants!
But the point is, the Psychologist WAS correct!
In my 40 year Navy career, I used my Type "A" personality to inject myself into every important mission.
Because of my experience, knowledge, boldness, and belief that I was the one who held the knowledge they needed, I was very successful.
Even those who did not like me had to respect me because I was almost always right.
You can't argue with success.
Now, my life is different.
So, how I deal with this is critical.
That was the Psychologist's message.
And I am now looking at my life and ways that I might be able to add "Value" to my life.
As Kathy reminded me, God did choose me to live the LBD life.
It was planned before I was made in my Mother's womb.
(Psalm 139)   And yes, this blog is something that I do that has value.
This blog is also therapy for me.
I can express my frustrations, pains, and fears, to you, my LBD support group.
Thanks.
Since we moved to Florida, the frustration of not having any value connection has grown.
I tried volunteering at the USS Alabama Memorial.
But the drive to Mobile is too much for me and there is no one that can take me.
Also, the work on the Turrets was too physical for me.
So that was a non- starter.
There is also the Bible Study at the the Assisted Living Facility is something I love and they depend on me too.
But getting ready for that study is demanding for me.
I also write a Navy blog that is also therapy for me.
There is another point that I have never discussed before.
I am stuck between two worlds.
Most of the time, I think I am still able to do anything!
Until I try to do something.
Then I realize I am not mentally or physically able to do what I used to do.
But I still want to!
Then, there are times when I don't want to do anything.
Especially in the evening.
Many nights I am somewhere between screaming and crying.
I miss my friends, my Church, the Navy, shooting events, and knowing people.
I am frustrated and even angry about what has happened to me.
Yet as I reflect on my life, I see so many mistakes, missteps, and character flaws.
Reflecting is not always good for me.
I told my wife the other night, and I wrote in in my personal journal, that I feel lost, misplaced, out of place.
I am not where I need to be but I don't know where I am supposed to be!
Sometimes, I want to throw everything away.
And other times, moving into a smaller place terrorizes me!
I am truly lost, without a direction, and without a desire to find out where I am supposed to go.
Lost!
I don't know where I was, where I am, or where I am going.
That frightening feeling was the first feeling that I experienced before I started this journey.
Totally lost, with no real value.
It would appear that I have found the root cause.
But, where do I go from here?
That is another question I don't have an answer too.

<doc date=Friday, March 14, 2014>
When I was at the Psychologist's office yesterday, he said something that I have been mulling over this morning.
He said I was a Type "A" personality guy and had a long, successful, carer in the Navy.
There I had value.
People sought out my opinion and looked to me for technical solutions.
I was a leader.
I briefed the Secretary of the Navy, the CNO, and other Admirals, not to mention the crew of just about every ship in the Surface Force of the Atlantic Fleet.
On ships, I was the senior Ordnance person.
I was, as the CPO Creed says,; "The fount of wisdom."
Now, no one looks to me for anything.
I am away from my Navy friends.
The grandsons have their own lives, and even my wife corrects me most of the time.
There is no place in my life that I am the subject matter expert.
No one who looks to me for critical answers.
And there is not even one person who wants to listen to my sea stories!
The Psychologist wants me to get involved in something I am passionate about.
Nothing comes to mind!!
Yes, I love our Bible Study at Bay Breeze Assisted Living Facility.
But they are the only people that are happy to see me and depend on me for anything.
Otherwise, I am mostly ignored, and sometimes a burden.
Maybe that is why my mind spends so much time back in the Navy.
There I was somebody of value.
The Psychologist was right!

<doc date=Thursday, March 13, 2014>
Today was my first visit with the psychologist for counseling.
It turned out better than I could have planned.
He is my age or a little older and he did his homework about LBD before my appointment.
He included my wife in the first visit in order to get to know us.
He was very congenial and cringe in his approach.
My wife and I both believe he has my best interests regarding my mental health as his priority.
We spent a considerable about of time discussing continuing care facilities.
He was antimate that we should get into a community sooner than later.
He said I would qualify now but that window is closing.
That brought up a discussion about the community we saw in Alabama, an hour away from where we presently live.
I have discussed this before.
While that facility has his recommendation, the distance from our area and the grandsons keep it from being a contender.
My wife brought up that facility on the way home and we had a discussion about it when we returned home.
We never have an argument.
I can count the number of arguments we have had in our 41+ year marriage on one hand.
But our discussion about the Alabama facility was "Spirited".
Today was a good day.
I am happy I was referred to this new Counselor and I look forward to my next visit, where he and I can delve into issues I have, alone.

<doc date=Wednesday, March 12, 2014>
After the move to Florida, we had to build a medical support group again.
I had the best Medical Support Group in Virginia with the primary member being my GP, Dr. Robert Dowdy.
Building a new team was not easy and it took a while with a few doctor firings and some tense moments.
But, we are about 90% there now.
Our Family Doctor is very good.
She is not Bob Dowdy, but she is good.
A few days ago, I had an appointment with her and I discussed some of the physical issues of my LBD.
Like me "soiling" my self.
She came back with some advice.
She asked me if I had seen the movie; "Bucket List"?
I had not.
So she regaled me with a line that Jack Nicholson used in the movie.
She told me; "Never trust a fart or waste an erection!"
That is good advice!
Since passing gas has lead to embarrassments and so has having to scratch my bottom.
The second half also makes sense since that part of my life is as messed up as everything else.
So, I am taking that advice when I remember it.
Generally I remember her advice after an accident!
Sort of like closing the barn after the horses have left!
Having a disease that will not be fired and will only get worse, requires a sense of humor!
My Family Doctor has one and I appreciate that.
Tomorrow, I go see a Psychologist to help me with some of the other emotional issues I have been struggling with.
I am reserving judgement until after a couple of visits with him.
A Psychologist can help me, or he can ruin my life.
In Florida, and in other states, he has the power and authority to institutionalize me, take away certain rights, like driving and ownership of things I cherish.
So, I am going to be reserved with him until I get a read on him.
That is, if I remember to be reserved with him.
It could be like my doctor's advice on passing gas!
</doc>
<doc date=Monday, March 10, 2014>
We have discussed future living considerations and we have come to a conclusion.
The Alabama facility is not a player.
We will continue to wait for Azalea Trace.
If that does not work, we will shelter in place.
In theory, it makes sense.
So, I agree.
I do admit I like Florida income tax laws.
None!
Alabama does tax our 401 when we draw the money out.
That is a big issue since it makes our money go farther!
I am still dealing with this decision even though I see it is logical and sound.
I have now stopped the search and I will no longer look for a facility to meet our needs.
That will help me make the decision more concrete.
That is that.

Maybe it will be easier when I am no long able to know or convey my desires.
Maybe it will be able when I don't care where I am or what I do.
Maybe things and people won't bother me when all I care about is sleep and ice cream.
But now, I still have opinions, desires, opinions, and emotions.
There in lies the problem!
Things upset me that never did before.
Now if you have known me for a while, you know I used to have an explosive temper.
I used that temper for good and bad.
Then, God taught me to control my temper, harness my emotions, and he taught me to love people.
For many years now, I have seldom lost my temper.
And each time I have, I have been ashamed of myself.
Now, LBD has taken away my social filters and I find myself unable to control my temper.
My outbursts are more frequent and more severe.
And while it is still not to the point of violence, I find myself more and more angry about things that should not upset me at all.
This concerns me more than anything else.
Last night, I lost my temper over an issue caused by our poodle getting under foot and tripping my wife.
I exploded!
Soon after I went to bed to brood and try to recompose myself.
It was 8PM.
When I got up this morning, I was only slightly better.
We went to Church but I admit I was very tempted not to go.
Church helped and the day progressed with me getting somewhat more in control and the gloom seemed to pass.
But the gloom returned this evening.
I have written before that I am unhappy with where and how we live.
But I would be hard pressed to select another place.
I do believe we would be better in a Continuing Care Retirement Community.
But the only one in our area is full!
We are on the waiting list, but it is not moving.
We saw an exceptional CCRC in Spanish Fort Alabama last Friday.
I believe it is perfect.
My wife disagrees.
I will not overrule her.
So, we wait and I stew.
We continue to try to make friends and establish relationships here.
But these people are unfriendly and clannish!!
We don't have a southern accent, so we are outsiders!!
Rednecks!
If they only knew us, they might change their mind!
But, since I think "Tar" is what you pave side roads with and not the four round things made of rubber on a car, we are outcasts.
My wife is a Saint.
She has a full plate, and I truly try not to add to her stress.
But it is hard when my desires conflict with her plans.
Maybe things will get better when I get worse.

OK, this is totally from my perspective.
I am still a fairly high functioning LBD patient, that is, most days and only during the daylight hours.
I have explained that nights are my worst enemy and that some days are not too good either.
I have also commented on the stress I see my wife and caregiver going through.
I see her frustration and disappointment.
I experience her anger and rage.
She is going through Hell with no outlet.
Yes, she has some Bible studies that she enjoys.
But she comes home to the reality of my disease.
I understand that is unrelenting and difficult, at best!
So, the question comes to mind, she is the right time to institutionalize a LBD patient?
I just read a post on the LBDA.org Community Board about a child trying to help a parent with LBD.
Their decision, based on the fact that their Mom was still fairly high mentally functioning, was to keep her in their home.
My question is, what do you do when she has her bad times?
Or when she gets worse?
Is making a good decision when the patient can participate in the decision better than making a hasty decision when her condition get bad?
There are times that I think, at least for me, that I would be better in a facility that limited the outside interference in my life.
A quiet place that would not agitate me.
A place where I could close the door to my room and be alone.
Also, there is the issue of finding a facility when you are at the "Amen" moment of a parent you can no longer take care of.
Where do you go then?
You are at the mercy of the system.
Rooms available, quality of care, tie to search for a facility, ll close in on you when you wait until the last moment.
No, I want this decision made when I can participate in it!
A continuing Care Retirement Community meets this need.
A facility with memory care and assisted living that are on site, with a reservation ready for you when you need it.
Also, what about respite care?
My wife may need a break from time to time.
Maybe a trip to a family reunion.
There should be a way to make life easier for her!
Now, the search for a CCRC that will take someone already diagnosed with LBD is a difficult one.
Many will not take you if you already have a diagnosis.
But there are some.
And the time to look is when you still are early in the early stages.
We are on the waiting list of a local CCRC.
But that list is not moving, so we are looking at others also.
The key here is, look now!
I am ready to be in a facility that has the capability to meet all of my needs and my wife's needs.
For instance, if she breaks a hip, who will care for her, and for me?
I cannot do my own meds now!
Well enough keep track of her meds.
I can cook, but going out for food is a non starter because I am not supposed to drive alone!
But, a CCRC would meet our needs for the convalescent period for her injury.
Obviously, I am firing on most cylinders mentally right now.
However, a few days ago, I was not.
You may remember I soiled my skivvies and had other issues related to LBD.
And my short term memory is shot!
I also have the issues of hallucinations, REM sleep disorder, and a little wandering.
So you see, in my mind, a little assistance would be nice.
I am ready for the next phase of this disease and ready for the next level of care.
WE just need to find the right place, in short order!

As a Christian, we should live our lives in a manner that is pleasing to God.
We should strive to be as "Christ Like as a redeemed sinner can be."
The goal being, hearing these words from God when our days on earth are done;  "Well done, thou good and faithful servant."
The most difficult challenge we face is how we deal with our immediate families.
All of us have been angry at our parents.
That anger started at a very young age.
Mom and Dad had rules we did not agree with.
Bed times, chores, don't stand on the dinner table, don't sass me, and curfews, are just a few that come to mind.
Yes, there were rules like, go to school, or get your grades up, or later in life, how are you going to pay this speeding ticket.
Mom and Dad's rules were not there to annoy us, although they did.
The rules were there to teach us life lessons, help build our characters, and most of all, to act as a guard rail to keep us from going off the road.
Still, some of us DID go off the road.
We did things that made our parents cringe!
And they got angry at us.
Why, because they love us, know we can do better, and want what is best for us.
Now, look at the relationship between adult children and elderly parents.
Many times, the parent is suffering form a log term disease like diabetes.
You as the child know what is best for your Mo or Dad.
No donuts!
No ice cream.
But Mom and Dad still want those taste treats.
And you get frustrated with your Mom or Dad.
Why, because you want what's best for them, you love them, and you know they really can do better with their sugar management!
Sound familiar?
I said earlier that, as Christians, we want to hear God say;  "Well done though good and faithful servant.
As a parent, do you know what we long to hear from our children?
Mom, Dad, you were right!
Thanks for being there for me.
You only get one Mom and one Dad.
Since they are older than you, they will, in most cases, die before you.
When that happens, you realize just how alone in this world you are.
Take the time to love your parents.
So what if they still try to steer you in the right direction.
That only shows they still care!

My last post was about a real issue that I deal with.
I have told you before that I spend more and more time in the past.
Doing that, brings back things that upset me then, and they upset me now.
It is like I am reliving these painful memories all over again.
If you think you were upset by what I wrote, you should have been in my head!!
I did not sleep for two or three nights.
This is related to me living in my memories and loosing my mental ability to sort these things our, past from today, and done with verses still facing!
I believe it is also connected to my loss os social filters.
But, I am not a doctor, so I may be all wet!
Still, I have received emails to my personal email address and comments on the blog side making sure I was OK.  Friends from Church and LBD friends.
I really appreciate all the confer, prayers, and advice.
It is good to have a support group this big and this caring.
So, as many of your in the LBD community know,  I will probably have to deal with these issues forever.
Writing about it actually helps me deal with these issues.
I also go see a psychologist in the next week or so and that may also help.
I am reserving judgement.
I have read other LBD blogs and understand what I am going through is not abnormal.
That is actually comforting to me.
For instance, when I punched my wife when I was having a violent dream, I felt terrible.
I had no idea that was going to be a LBD problem.
My neurologist's reply was; "I was expecting that!"
She could have warned me!
I would have bought my wife a catcher's mask!
So, onward and upward.
I am doing better.
Not great, but better.
And you had a big part in making me feel better!
Thanks.
And for the people I mentioned in my previous post;  I am still mad at you!
Call me or I will call you.
Unless you are already dead!!
Than, I will leave you alone.

<doc date=Tuesday, February 25, 2014>
I am up again tonight.
Unable to sleep because of anger issues.
It is interesting, as I look back over my life at the decisions I have made.
The accomplishments of my life and my failures.
The goals I have chased and accomplished and the goals that are left unfulfilled.
There are things that haunt me but few things that give me comfort.
One of the things that cause me great angst and emotional pain is the fact than no one that is a blood relative to me, in my generation or older will have any contact with me.
I have a half brother in Westlake, Ohio with the exact same name as me and he will not talk with me or write to me.
Maybe he thinks I want to take my share of the magnificent Dolence fortune!
Of course, there is no Dolence fortune.
Then there is my half sister, that contacted me!
She is our fathers daughter by his first marriage.
I was born after her, probably while her parents were getting a divorce.
She actually knew our Grandparents for a short time.
If you have not figured it our, our Father was a womanizing Cad that took NO responsibility for his progeny.
At least until after Sandi and were born.
He never paid a dime of child support for me.
He left my Mother to fend for herself.
He never wondered about me or had anything to do with me.
I did finally locate him when I was 31.
We talked on the telephone twice.
I told him I had a son, so he had a Grandson.
He was not interested.
He died in 1989.
Too bad.
His loss for not knowing me.
There are other kids out there fathered by Donald Andrew Dolence Sr.
They will have no contact with me either.
Curious, when I see one of those movies or television shows where the parent gets together with the long lost child.
You know the ones with the tearful happy, reunions, after decades of being apart.
Generally, the child was given up for option after a teen pregnancy!
Sound familiar.
Well, it is my experience that no one in polite society wants to have any contact with the "Bastard" son.
My birth Mother's own sister in law called me that!
Yes, Aunt Ella, Uncle John Kampf's wife, my Mother's Brother, did not want Betty's bastard son falling in live with her daughters!
Love, I was just happy to meet someone that I was related too.
I'm not from West Virginia, I don't date relatives!
Especially, First Cousins!!
Now, I was raised by the very best people in the world.
They loved me!
They were concerned that I would grow up angry at my circumstances.
They gave me direction and taught me to work hard.
I learned a lot from Mom and Dad.
They spent their retirement years raising a child that was not theirs!
They too me in, with little or no monetary help, and raised me.
I will never be able to repay them for their kindness and love.
I look at my Navy career.
From my first day in Boot Camp, I liked the Navy.
Why, because I belonged!
I was the same as everyone else and I had the same chance at promoting as anyone else.
It took hard work, dedication, and sacrifice.
When advancement tests were coming up, I studied 2 hours a day, 7 days a week, for 6 months before the test.
When I took the Navy wide test for Chief (E-7), I got the highest score possible; 80 out of 80!
I was one of the youngest Master Chiefs (E-9) ever in the Navy.
I was promoted to Master Chief Gunner's Mate at 14 years, 6 months of service.
I was the first Surface Warfare Qualified sailor on the west coast.
The first Master Training Specialist designated at Great Lakes in 1977!
I took the tough jobs and did the best I could.
I love the Navy.
It finished what my Mom and Dad started!
I met an LDO Boat's wain who was on the Insurv Board when I was a Gun Mount Tech Rep for NAVSEACENLANT.
He swore up and down that he knew me from back home.
Talked to me about it a number of times.
Then one day, her said he made a mistake.
would bet money he knew my brother Donald, and after talking to him, stepped away from me.
You know; "Step AWAY from the bastard!!"
I wish I did not drink as much alcohol as I did!
Bill Mowery's wife once told me;  I never knew you drank until I saw you sober!
Not a good testimony.
I wish I had half the money I wasted on booze!
Atleast I quit that habit.
I met and married a wonderful Christian woman who helped me deal with many of the demons that haunted me.
She lead me to a saving knowledge of Jesus Christ.
Taught me Bible.
Encouraged me to teach an lead in our many churches.
Then I me Pastor Fred Devan who took all the good my wife, other Pastors and a few Navy Chaplains had done and built a Pastor in me.
I remember when Fred told me I should preach!
But I did learn to Preach and I did a fairly competent job.
AT least no one got up and left during one of my sermons!
But, I know it is God using me, and not me being so good, when I preach God's word.
That is the most humbling part of working for the Lord.
I have other failings I will not discuss with anyone.
Things I am ashamed of and that only God knows about.
They are forgiven by God through the atoning sacrifice of Jesus Christ!
But, much like pounding a nail in a wood barn door, and then taking the nail out.
It leaves a lasting mark!
I wish I was better at so man things.
I wish I appreciated what I had when I had it, instead of always chasing the next goal.
I never really enjoyed where I was at.
I was in too much of a hurry to get up the ladder.
Never really knowing where I was going too.
Now, with age and maturity, I can see I ran past many enjoyable experiences, missing them all together.
Why, because success was just around the corner.
Never knowing, I was already a success.
Much of what I lived my life for is being destroyed by today's Progressive movement.
Who I was and what I did is looked on as a wasted life.
Today, to be a success, you have to smoke pot, be in a homosexual relationship, and be on the government dole!
Sorry folks, none of that applies to me.
But, you know what hurts the most?
With the exception of my wife, no one really understands my pain or even cares that I have it.
As long as they don't have to meet me, or acknowledge me.
Their happy.
Even Sandi Share, my half sister who contacted me out of the blue, will not talk to me or agree to a meeting.
But, I guess I am still in a hurry to get somewhere.
In a hurry for this disease to progress.
Since I am such a "Black Sheep", the blessing of dementia will be a relief instead of a personal burden.
I know, when God calls me home, I will be in the presence of the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords.
Then I will really be where I am supposed to be.
And I will be with my Father in Heaven, and my Christian family.
Maybe, that is where I have been rushing to be, all along.
All I know is, this disease makes me live, mentally, in my past.
And while I think about the Navy most of the time.
Painful memories come to the forefront also.
Things that make me angry and regretful.
Writing this blog is my best therapy.
But it is still difficult to be who I am.
Again, this blog is my therapy.
I do not write it to embarrass anyone.
I write it to get things off my chest and the burr our from under my saddle.
If I offend someone, Oh well!
It is MY blog and nothing I write is untrue.
So, live with it.
Or better yet, contact me!
I would love to talk with you.

I am receiving more and port comments and emails from caregivers of LBD patients that are traveling the same path as I am.
They look OK, act OK, talk OK, to the uneducated.
They look normal to the people that do not live with the.
Most people do not see them in a rage after the sun goes down.
Their relatives don't see them do the crazy things that we do and don't understand why we get yelled at for them.
Like making a paper hat at a Church meeting and then wearing it!
It is good for me to know I am not the only individual doing strange things and saying things that people are shocked by.
My poor wife is constantly trying to keep me in line.
Not because I embarrass her but because she is trying to keep me from embarrassing myself!
More and more, I avoid social engagements.
Crowds or even small groups of people overwhelm me.
When we go to Church on Sunday morning, I am frightened of the crowd.
My vision closes down to a pencil point.
I look around me, but I see little.
I do much better at home.
So, I am glad my little blog acts a an avenue to bring us together!!
I encourage more of you to join our support group!!
We can help each other deal with the ups and downs of LBD.
Thanks!

Today, we volunteered at the concession stand for our Grandson's Lacrosse game.
The team makes the money it needs to equip and travel the team through the selling of food at the games.
The parents provide the man power.
They had a need for volunteers, so we pitched in.
The amount of work was  not difficult.
It was a slow day for food and drinks.
I had time to talk our middle Grandson's Father.
He works for the Navy and has a deep background in Navy things I enjoy.
He even know many of the folks I used to interface with.
He and I talked for about a half hour and at the end of the conversation I could feel myself sagging mentally.
By the time we got home, I was a basket case.
I actually had to sit down because I was unsteady on m feet.
I feel completely depleted of energy and I cannot deal with any conversation of mental interference.
I feel dizzy and unstable on my feet and my energy level is on empty.
This is completely opposite from where I was yesterday.
This is a prime issue with LBD.
But this drop was more pronounced than before.
Maybe because I was exposed to so many folks I did not know.
Or maybe the 30 minute conversation, high energy,  centered on Navy.
But I am worn out and headed to bed.
</doc>
<doc date=Friday, February 21, 2014>
The weather has been war the last few days.
I have been able to get out in the fresh air and sunshine.
I always feel better when it is warm and I can get out.
Yesterday, I felt so good I mower the lawn.
Well, actually, the winter weeds.
Yes, in Northwest Florida we grow winter weeds!!
Both mowers started right up.
Thank you Stabil!
I really enjoyed riding the tractor around the back yard.
I went to bed very early last night.
I was tired and I felt the effects of "Sundowning" coming on and I did not want to put up with it!
I sole up this morning raring to go.
By 9AM I was cleaning the inside of the car.
Vacuuming the carpets in the car, washing the windows inside and out.
The car is now clean, inside.
Then we went to Lowe's and bought some week killer, mulch, and a new string trimmer.
We came home and I spread the pre-emergent week killer, spread the mulch around our Crepe Myrtle tree in the front yard, and used my new string trimmer to trim the fence line in the back yard!
I was a ball of energy.
Now, I am resting.
For the first time in a while, I feel like I accomplished something.
This is a good feeling.
It is important for me to do the things that I used to do.
Next week, I am going to wash and wax the car.
That may take all week and in the past I could accomplish that in 4 hours.
But it will be done, by me.
Maybe I can't drive alone anymore, but I can wash and wax the car, just like old times!
That will make me feel better.
Since it is warming up, the old fight is coming back and I feel good.
I hope this weather pattern stays with us.
I know I can get depressed, grumpy, and difficult to be around.
Even though I try not to be.
But days like this, get me back on track.
So, I knew I had to share this with you.

<doc date=Tuesday, February 18, 2014>
Today, I had a Doctor's appointment with my GP.
She is an exceptional doctor.
Caring, interested, and dedicated to my well being.
I have told her how lucky I am to have her as my doctor.
In our discussion I admitted to her, at her questioning, that I normally pretended, acted like, and put on the face of, being normal.
I also admitted to her that, for the first time, I feel defeated.
The symptoms, issues, and problems caused by the Lewy Body tangles in my brain, are overwhelming me.
That's it, the fight is over, throw in the towel, I loose.
Lewy Body Dementia has won.
Now, much like a football team, down by 10 touchdowns, in the third quarter, I am not going to stop playing.
I just know I cannot win and the loss will only get worse.
That may upset some of you.
It did me until I admitted it.
Now, I am OK with it.
Like the football team previously mentioned, admitting defeat may be the better part of valor.
The bottom line is, I need to give into the issues of LBD and quit fighting them.
I am tired of fighting.
My Doctor recommended I make an appointment with a counselor that I can openly address these issues with.
I know she is right and I am going to contact a counselor that she recommended tomorrow.
I need to talk to someone that has no investment in me!
Why?
Because everyone who has an investment in me wants me to be 100% all of the time.
Because of that, I put on a brave front and act 100%.
And, because of that, I am not honest about my how I feel mentally or what is happening in my mind.
Again, LBD is a journey.
There are numerous way stations along the way.
Victories and losses.
Highs and lows.
But if you ask the Quarterback of that loosing team if they had a chance to win when they came out for the second half, the answer would be a resounding, YES!
Even though he knew they were out weighed by 1000 pounds on the offensive live and the receivers  on the opposing team were a foot taller than their defenders!
Oh, and the quarterback of the loosing team was blind!
At some point, you have to get tired of saying, I am still going to win!
And I am.
I also remember my best friend, Jerry's Mom at his daughters wedding.
She had Lupus and we all worried about her.
Evidently, many of us had asked her how she was doing and it was wearing thin.
I stepped into an elevator that she was already on and I asked her;  Hoe are your holding up?
She replied loudly and curtly; Fine, what about you!
The point is, she was tired of people asking and having to put on a brave face.
She was extremely tired and worn out.
I did not take exception to her comment and I hope most of you won't either.
It's time for me to let this disease do it's thing.
</doc>
<doc date=Sunday, February 16, 2014>
When I was young, I never understood why older people always talked about their medical issues.
Now I know!
You medical issues are always on your mind!
From pills, to doctor's appointments, to future plans.
Everything you do or will do rotates around what is wrong with you.
In my case, I am consumed by what my future mental and physical capabilities will be.
I have a pretty good idea, and that is what drives my waking thoughts.
It is said we become our parents.
There is also an old saying I learned in the Navy; " I know a lot of old people, and I know a lot of dumb people.
But I don't know any old, stupid, people!
You have to be smart to get old!!"
That being said, I am going to use some of that accumulated wisdom to guide the rest of my life.
Psalm 139 tells us, all the days of our life, were written in God's book, before we were formed in our Mother's womb!
Since that IS the truth, God knew I was going to have this disease.
And God already knows how this will turn out.
SO, why should I waste my time and energy worrying about how to provide for myself and my wife in the future.
In the twelfth chapter of Luke, Jesus says God feeds the worthless ravens and give the grass better clothes that Solomon had, why do we worry about what we are to eat of wear?
Since God loves us much more than that worthless raven and lowly grass!
Again, if that is so, and it IS, then I should trust God to take care of Linda and me.
This is now my new plan for what remains of my life.
I am going to live as if I have no disease.
Live as a "Saved by Grace" son of God.
And lay ALL my burdens at the foot of the Cross!
Now, understand, I am still going to follow medical advice.
I have limited my driving, I take all my prescribed medicines, and I exercise and eat a balanced diet.
I visit my GP, Dentist, Neurologist, and Psychiatrist, as scheduled.
But, I am going to LIVE my life for Christ.
That does not include moping around waiting for the next shoe to drop.
Yes, a few have dropped recently.
But, I feel better today, after Church and lunch, than I have since Christmas.
No, my hallucinations have not stopped.
I saw a horse on Interstate 10 today!
With saddlebags!!
You don't see that too much on freeways!
But, who cares, I know it was not real.
Or at least I am fairly sure.
I still have something to give and that is what I am going to do.
So, for the foreseeable future, Gulf Breeze Florida is our home base.
God's Word offers us so much wisdom and so much encouragement.
We must stop listening to the world and start listening to God.
The world wants us defeated!
God wants us empowered.
He wants us empowered so much that He defeated the power of death through the sacrificial death of Jesus, His son.
If we claim that promise, we are untouchable by the world.
Jesus told his decibels, the world may kill you.
but not one hair on your head will perish.
Now I understand what he meant!!
Praise the Lord!

I have received some "Flak" over my ability to write and describe my journey with LBD.
Some have even question if I was a fake!
Well, I assure you I am not malingering.
But I read a post on the Lewy Body Dementia Association web site from a wife/caregiver who's husband has also been able to retina a reasonably high level of cognitive ability, especially in his writing  He too had an exceptional memory and mental capability before being diagnosed with LBD.
He also was prescribed the Alzheimer's drugs Excelon and Namenda, early.
She stated they their neurologist told them it was rare for someone to resting that level of cognition.
But, there he is!
Much like other LBD issues, since we do not have a media that we can communicate our issues on, in the open, we don't know what others are experiencing.
The LBDA Social Forums do offer some insight into others journey with LBD.
But it is sporadic and subject to the ability of the writer to convey the issued experienced buy their loved one.
For instance, my dreams are horrific!
Last night I was terrified to go to bed because I had such horrific dreams when we napped in the afternoon.
My wife said I was "Punching the air" in my sleep and she stayed away from me in self defense.
Since I HAVE punched her in my sleep before, that was good reasoning.
She asked me what my dream was about and the description did not do the dream justice.
That is the issue in second hand writing.
So, while I have a fairly thick skin, some comments about being a "Fake" do effect me.
It was good to read about another LBD suffer that was retaining the ability to write.
I wish he would start a blog to educate others about the ravages of this disease.
As for me, my LBD is progressing and dreams, dark moods, and other issues continue to be an issue.
I prefer to be alone or only with my wife.
I avoid crowds at all costs.
I have increasing difficulty finding the words to verbally express what is in my mind.
Writing is easy, because I can stop, use spell check, and go back and rewrite, as needed.
In verbal communications, those corrections show, blazingly.
I no longer remember the activities of the day before and those autonomic functions continue to fail, malfunction, and operate intermittently.
Not fun, but not a show stopper either.
I am better off than many of my fellow LBD compatriots and I am glad for that.
But I am farther down the journey than most of you realize.
I can still play the part of a "normal" person when I need too.
It is a game!
But, more and more, I don't want to play the game.
I need to be comfortable with the condition that I am in, and so do you.
Read the LBDA.org site and learn more about this disease before you throw any more rocks my way!

<doc date=Thursday, February 13, 2014>
Today, I was notified that three separate men who I was contacted to, directly or indirectly, passed away.
Death is always a sobering event for us.
We cling to life so strongly that we fear death.
Why, because it is the unknown.
No one we can talk to can tell us about death.
What happens when you die.
What is next?
Now, I am a born again believer and I believe what the Bible tells us about death.
1 Corinthians15:52 tells us that "in the twinkling of an eye" we will be with Jesus.
What happens next is important.
If we have accepted the free gift of salvation paid for by the atoning death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ, we will be in Heaven.
If we denied that free gift, our destination is Hell.
Today, three men died that I believe are with our Savior right now.
The first notification I received was the death of a close friend where I worked.
His Dad was a World War Two veteran who spent the entire War on the USS Bache (DD-470).
He survived two Kamikaze attacks.
Don and I shared stories about our Dads.
Their habits, humorous times, and life stories.
We used to laugh at how our Dads did things, and how WE were becoming our Dads as we aged!
His Dad passed away a couple of days ago.
I know Don will miss him.
I do too and I never met him.
The second was a man who suffered from the same disease that I do.
He was also a Navy Gunner's Mate.
I faithfully read his wife's Blog as she described her journey as a caregiver for her husband who had Lewy Body Dementia.
Our kinship in our journey made his passing personal for me.
Then, this evening, we received a telephone call from my wife's 93 year old cousin in Iowa.
Her husband, a great man of God, passed away this morning.
This was a second marriage for both of them.
Both were widowed early in life and they married and had 27 great years together.
Louis was a great example of a husband, man, and Christian.
He and I became friends when we visited them a few years ago.
It was like we had always been together.
He passed from this life into the presence of the Lord, quietly, gently, in his sleep.
Just as if Jesus Himself was ushering Louis into Heaven.
Looking at today's events, my fear of Death has all but passed.
But I marvel at the passing of people I know.
Yes, I miss them.
But in most cases, I realize they are in the presence of the Lord.
They are in His loving arms.
Welcomed home.
That is something to look forward too, not fear.

Since we moved to the Pensacola area, there are services we were used to in Virginia Beach that East Lower Alabama just does not have.
Like street lights, schools that teach, anything of the service sector open on Saturday or Sunday, and anything serving retired people.
I know you think; "Move to Florida for retirement."
Well, that is Tampa, Orlando, Miami, anywhere in the peninsula of Florida.
The panhandle is really Alabama in every sense of the word.
These morons even import "Sticks".
The are not IN the sticks.
They have to go get them.
Now if you lived here your entire life, it probably would not bother you.
Since you can't read, don't have manners, and have expectations lower that a sewer pipe!
I hate this place!
Why am I so upset?
Well, the only Men's barber shop in Gulf Breeze is only open Monday through Friday, 0730-1700.
No nights, no Saturdays.
Now, I hate going to places that do women's hair for a hair cut.
I hate the smell of the junk they put on their hair!
Beauty parlors, an oxymoron, smell terrible and I will not go in one!!
I get my hair cut by men in a Men's Barber Shop.
No women allowed.
I do not go where the girly men go!
So, I called ahead and got my name on the list.
I showed up when I was told to.
And they were chock full!
Even though my name was on the list, I waited 90 minutes and I still did not get a haircut.
I finally left when the barber I used to like took someone who missed his turn, before me.
It will be a cold day in Hell before I go into that barber shop again!!
Not to mention I paid $20 per haircut!
Screw them.
Screw East Lower Alabama.
I will cut my hair myself.
Now, my anger is another issue that has surfaced over the last few weeks.
I normally hold my anger in check except for the rare times someone pushes me past my limit.
Then, I always could be dangerous.
But I have not been this angry since the Spanish immigrants in the Seniors Apartment in Virginia Beach commandeered the elevator in our building to move in and would not let us use it to take our groceries up to the third floor.
That one almost caused a fight.
I am not a happy camper and I will be in bed soon.
Don't call me tonight,  It would not be pretty!
Update;  Do you see your loved one in my diatribe?
Anger at things we can't understand or can't control is a real problem.
I have been angry since this morning when my bathroom incident occurred!
As I have said before, this is a brutal disease that negatively effects the patient and the caregiver.

In most cases, the primary caregiver in any dementia patient is the spouse.
But the spouse has a much more intimate connection than just being a caregiver.
There are issues the spouse must deal with that a caregiver will never deal with.
The most important being the pending loss of your spouse.
That loss starts long before death.
Memory loss, sleep issues, ugly dreams, disorientation, sexual dysfunction, sun downing, mood swings, and many other issues.
Some begin early and some come on later.
But it is the spouse that has to deal with each and every one.
I have punched my wife, HARD, acting out a dream.
Woke her up in the middle of the night and asked her what her name was, had bathroom accidents in the shower and my pants, and she has spent many an evening with me being so grouchy and jumpy that bed was the only good place for me.
Then there is the loss of the marriage partner.
The person you used to make decisions WITH!
The other person who drove the car, mowed the lawn, washed the car, or even cared that the car was dirty!
You see, the personality of a dementia patient completely changes.
Apathy, depression, lack of interest in daily living,decision making ability,are all gone or severely degraded.
All of these losses are uncompensated!
There is no one to help your spouse with the things you used to do.
And, it is never going to get any better.
Truthfully, it is going to get much worse!
No wonder many marriages end in diverse for dementia patients.
I am blessed, my wife is my best friend.
She is the person I want to be with, share everything with, and trust, totally!
We are committed to seeing this through.
Committed may be a destination however!
Lewy Body Dementia is a crazy journey.
But I know we will make it together.
If you are related to someone who is the spouse of a LBD patient, help them.
Be their friend, support, and shoulder to cry on.
Spouses that are caregivers lack a person to share the frustration with.
Someone that has a shoulder to cry on.
I appreciate the sacrifices my wife is making.
This is certainly not the retirement we planned.
But, we are together and working for the same goal.
We are in love and respectful of each others abilities and problems.
I am blessed.
I pray others are too.

<doc date=Tuesday, February 4, 2014>
I have learned that is is imperative that someone with LBD have an extensive network of support.
There are the obvious members of this read; Neurologist, GP Family Physician, maybe even a physical therapist.
But what about a Psychiatrist?
Or a Psychologist?
A strong medical team is important.
But what about respite care?
How does your caregiver get a break from the crushing daily stress of taking care of everything you need?
I can tell you that having a counselor to discuss the many mental disturbances that come with LBD may be the most important person on your team.
It does not necessarily need to be a Psychologist.
It can be a trained mental health counselor or even a Pastor.
But you do need someone to talk to.
Physical therapists deal with movement disorders of all kinds, including the swallowing issues that cause us to ASPIRATE!
That is the number one cause of death in LBD patients.
I am having en increasing problem with aspirating.
Even the rote reflex of swallowing saliva has caused me to aspirate recently.
I have an appointment with my Neurologist soon and I will ask for a referral to a physical therapist for this issue.
Friends, are the most important part of your support network.
Nothing cheers me up more than a call from my best friend Jerry Hart!
I can be ME with him.
We talk Navy issues,  cars, football, health issues, even politics.
Each week, he and I spend at least an hour on the telephone and it keeps me going.
Of course, having friends that can come sit with you while your caregiver goes out to shop, Bible study, or with friends for a break is important also.
I remember when I had my colon surgery, almost 13 years ago.
The two days before the surgery, I had to fast.
Jerry sat with me both days while my wife was at work!
His company, our conversations, made me forget that I was not eating.
Friends like that are few and far between.
If you have one, you are blessed.
I know some folks that hide their disease.
They try to look normal.
They do not want anyone to know and do not want sympathy.
I suffered from part of that fantasy.
While I embraced LBD, I made light of it!
And I did not want any one's sympathy.
Well, now I realize I need every one's help and I no longer try to look normal.
As a matter of fact, I am completely open about my disease.
Why, how else will someone learn about the second most diagnosed dementia?
LBD is a frightening disease!
It is not something you want to face alone.
So having a complete support network is important.
I am sure you can add other members to this team.
The more the better.

I have said before that my Father in Law had Alzheimer's.
He had it a while before we knew about it.
His wife, kept him going.
She was his memory, his direction, his motivation.
Then, Kelma died and Kurt was completely lost.
Kelma had a letter written telling Kurt to come to Virginia and live with us.
That was a good idea, except we had no warning of his disease.
To top it off, Kurt was a deaf as a stone wall!
We did all we could to get him physically healthy.
He had some serious dental problems they an oral surgeon fixed and made some new dentures for him.
We bought him a new hearing aid, that did not help!
But we tried.
We made a bedroom for him and did all we could to make him comfortable.
But he wasn't.
The doctor he went to finally told us he wanted to go back to California.
We made that happen.
Now, having a parent live with you is always difficult.
Add in his mental handicap and the fact that we were never told about it, and things were very difficult.
You might say, we should have known he had dementia.
Well, he was so deaf, and always was, we thought that was his issue.
We were wrong.
Add to the fact that we were in our 30's and had a preteen son.
I was making deployments on a Tin Can and trying to make a living for my family, including Kurt.
Kurt later came back to us and we found the best professional care we could.
But, there were no Memory Support facilities in the late 1980's.
He only had social security coming in.
Again, we did our best.
Now, when I see things like the Gaither Homecoming Shows, I think of Virginia and long, so much to be home with my friends and in my Church.
I miss my Navy friends.
They are my family too.
I muss hearing my Pastor preach and him and his wonderful wife sing.
I miss the hugs and friendship of longtime friends.
I miss knowing where I am.
I now understand why Kurt was so disrupted in his move to Virginia.
I wish I would have understood his confusion and agitation then.
But I do now and I identify with his distress.
I never thought Kurt and I would be kindred spirits, but we are.
I now understand.

This is our third winter in Florida.
The last two have been mild.
But the year looks like Cleveland!!
Temps in the teens, ice storms, snow, schools closed, road, closed, power failures, businesses closed, runs on stores, this is crazy!!
My driveway is a sheet of ice and this is the third day!
But I did experience something interesting.
The first time the power went out, I was reclined in my lift chair.
Without me touching any controls, it automatically put the chair to it's stored position.
It did not lift me up, but it put the foot portion down and the back straight up!
Nice feature!
And it is faster than if I use the controller.
So, if I am in my chair and the telephone rings, I would do better to pull the power cord than use the controller.
It is faster!
We are going out today to hold our weekly Bible Study at the local Assisted Living Facility.
It is only a few blocks away and the road in front of our home looks clear.
It is just the driveway that offers a challenge to my Subaru!
And people laughed at me for having a Subaru in Florida!!
Looks like I get the last laugh.

I have been married to my wife for 41 years.
41 good years!
I have done good things and not so good things.
Sometimes, the not so good things were my fault and sometimes not.
I suspect I am the same as any husband.
No better and no worse.
But, throw in the stress and anxiety on the caregiver and those small things become major issues.
Discussing symptoms and problems I am having can often lead to curt replies and hurt feelings for both of us.
The other day, we went to take a nap, and when we turned off the lights, I could not see my wife.
I asked her where she was and she was upset in her reply.
She said she thought I was messing with her!
I was not!
She then understood I was having vision issues.
I realize she is overwhelmed with the impact of LBD and the very uncertain future.
That level of stress, the broken dreams and unrealized plans, must be overwhelming.
But the person with the disease is not the villain.
The disease is the villain.
I also realize I constantly talk about issues related to my LBD.
I used to talk about cars, guns, new houses, Navy, the guys I worked with, or sports.
Now, discussion about where to live is centered around a retirement community with memory care.
I don't like to travel, and I get grumpy when the sun goes down.
I have little energy, numerous physical and mental complaints, and I have not adapted to Florida very well.
So, I realize living with me is no picnic.
But living with LBD is no picnic either.
Living with LBD as the one with the disease or as the care giver requires compromise in both cases.
What the LBD symptoms cause are not my fault and certainly not done on purpose.
And how my wife sees my symptoms is not her fault.
We both need to communicate in a non-judgmental manner, keeping each other's feelings in mind.

<doc date=Saturday, January 25, 2014>
I have been having a down turn in my mental capabilities and my emotional health recently.
I am overwhelmed with the symptoms of this disease.
I am aspirating more, having extended bouts of constipation, vision issues, and sexual disfunction issues.
All of these symptoms have been increasing over recent times, but they are all happening at once and I am completely overwhelmed.
I have often said that LBD was a god disease to have if your had to have one because I forget the things that bother me.
This is still somewhat true, but when everything goes wrong at the same time, I remember what is bothering me and I don't like it.
I do not want to be around people or go anywhere.
I have upsetting dreams that I cannot wake up from.
I spend hours trying to think of people's names, or events in my life.
Then, when I remember they name or event, I don't remember why I wanted to remember that.
This downturn has been different than any other before.
I even have problems describing what is happening to me.
This is frustrating!
I am so upset I want to scream!
My wife believes this will abate and I hope she is right.
If not, this is a major change and one I did not expect or see coming.
That may be the most devastating part of LBD for me.
I was doing so well that I was lulled into feeling I was going to be OK.  Now I know I was wrong.
But, hope does keep us going.
As I read over this post, it show how upset and disconnected I am right now.
But, I told you I would always tell you what was going on during my LBD journey.
This is the latest installment.

 I have memories of my Dad and the frustrations he felt when my Mom was dieing of cancer.
He told me that when he was young he left home and was working his way to California.
He started in Allentown, Pa and then went to Buffalo, New York.
From there he went to Cleveland, Ohio.
That is where he met the love of his life and he never left there.
He always wanted to see Alaska.
But he never did.
Those unfulfilled dreams always came out as regrets when he was sad or depressed.
When Dad was feeling his Wheaties, he wanted to go back to Buffalo to relive his "Wild" days.
Those were the days of Prohibition and the "Speak Easies".
He used to tell me how fast he could drive to Buffalo from Cleveland.
Of course, he never did that either.
But I can still hear Dad's booming voice saying; "Let's go to Buffalo Donnie!"
We should have gone.
Dad should have gone to Alaska too.
But the responsibilities of family prevented all of those dreams from being realized.
I never understood that until recently.
I have my regrets too.
Not of places I wanted to see but the life style I wanted to live.
I know I have said this before, but my concrete house on 40 acres is always in my mind.
A dream I will never fulfill.
But a constant dream just the same.
Just like Dad's dreams of Alaska and Buffalo.
Again, I have traveled the world and done things most men only dream of.
Dangerous, exciting, things that great stories come from.
And a few stupid things that also make the story line.
But there are still those things I wanted to do, that just never happened.
As time passes, we become our parents!
I now understand Dad's regrets.
And I understand why he chose to never fulfill them.
Responsibility, love, family, are all powerful influences on a Man's dreams.
What we want as young men, we seldom realize.
For instance, I still do not have a Corvette.
Probably never will.
But the dream lives, along with my survivalist life style dream.
It does not matter how much you accomplished or how successful you were.
There will always be those things that you wanted to do, that there was just never time or money for.
Those are the memories that fill you thoughts as you see your life drawing to a close.
I know that now and that understanding actually comforts me.
It is good to understand the mysteries of the past.

Last night, as I was getting ready to go to sleep, a feeling of total dismay overwhelmed me.
I felt like I had no home state and no place to call home.
I have felt unsettled since we moved to Florida.
We lived in Virginia for over 30 years.
All my friends are there and the Surface Navy is there.
On the other hand, most of the people I have run into here in the  Panhandle of Florida are hard to get to know, to say the least.
On top of this, I have been experiencing a downturn in my mental capabilities.
My wife discussed that with me tonight.
Now, she approached it in a very positive way.
She told me I was here hero for facing this so bravely.
I knew I had slipped a few steps when she said that.
I noticed difficulties conducting the Bible study we hold at the local Assisted Living Facility.
I love those folks and I connect so well with them.
But today, I had problems finding words, describing the thoughts in my mind, and even connecting with the folks.
I have also gone back to taking long afternoon naps.
It helps me be more civil and less grumpy in the evening.
As far as decisions go.
I can't make one.
For instance, we are on the waiting list for a Continuing Care Retirement Facility.
If you ask me if i want to move or not, i really can't say.
One moment I am comfortable with the move, the next I want to stay here.
Then I want to build my concrete house on 40 acres!
This inability to settle on our future living accommodations causes me problems also.
I guess my real answer is, I really don't care.
But the hassle of the move is overwhelming to me.
Which is comical since we have moved so many times before.
But now, it frightens me big time.
I have noticed that I have less interest in life and the world around me.
I can no longer do the things I like to do.
I have no friends to do things with, and I have no connection to the place I live.
This has been a rough month for me.
But I knew it was coming!
With LBD, there is always a steep decline after a good period.
And I am in that decline right now.
When will it end.
Soon I hope.

<doc date=Wednesday, January 22, 2014>
I have tried to describe my feelings throughout this blog.
Now, a new emotion is beginning to develop and it should be discussed.
There is a movie that Linda and I have watched a couple of times that I recommend for anyone with or caring for someone with any dementia.
The title is "Safe House" with Patrick Stewart.
The premise is that the main character is progressing through the journey of a dementia.
He was a secret operative and has secrets that could cause him to be killed.
At first, his children think he is paranoid because of his dementia.
Of course, he knows different.
He tries to keep his mind working through memory games and security drills ran buy his good friend.
In the end, he realizes he can no longer defend himself!
That realization that the person with dementia can no longer provide for himself is the inner terror!
Like the character in the movie, I was self reliant.
Able to handle any situation.
Self assured.
A career Navy Master Chief Gunner's Mate that dealt with life and death decisions in gun mounts!
My word was law in those gun mounts and on the ships in the ordnance areas.
I had good judgement and I was sought out for special assignments that were dangerous, complicated, and that had severe consequences.
Now, people even doubt me when I describe my disease.
I can see it in their faces.
I feel less and less comfortable driving, and decisions are made by others.
What I feared has come to be.
Sometimes, I want to curl up in a safe room, locked in, where no one can get to me.
I long to be able to control my environment, what I experience, and who I let in.
I am better when I am with my wife or my son.
But even then, I realize I am not the protector that I once was.
When I am alone, I will not leave the house or open the door.
I keep the telephone close at all times and I am wary of any sound.
My trusty poodles keep watch, alerting at any noise.
Much like the main character in the movie, I tried to play memory games to prove to myself that my memory was fine.
But they only reinforce the fact that I cannot remember things.
Even my deeply engraved old Navy memories are fading.
The MK 42 gun mount that I loved so much and knew so much about is fading from memory.
Last night, before I went to sleep, I was trying to remember the sequence of operation of that gun mount.
I couldn't.
For me, that is the sign of problems.
This inner fear, even terror, is felt, by ever dementia patient.
The world around us becomes a place to fear.
People are all strangers, places are all new, situations are all threatening.
I long to see familiar faces, but I seldom do.
I long to do familiar things, but people who say they will go with me to do those things don't.
They have work, family, chores, and issues of their own.
It amazes me that people that I know, even relatives, go to great extremes not to see me or be with me.
It is as if they think I am contagious!
Soon, like the character in the movie, I will give in to the fact that I can no longer do for myself.
That I am totally dependent on others.
But for now, I will cling to any independence that I can.
Trying to remain in the normal world, as the unfamiliar world closes in on me.
This is a terrifying disease.

This week is a television week I wait for all year!
It is the Barrett-Jackson Collector Car auction in Scottsdale Arizona.
I am a car NUT!!
This auction has cars that I could only dream about.
SPEED Channel used to carry wonderful coverage of this event.
Starting on Tuesday night, 4 or more hours of cars being auctioned off, deep inspections of those cars, and wonderful memories of the cars of my youth.
Friday and Saturday, SPEED had 12 hours of coverage seeing that these were the days that the Big Money cars were presented.
I was in car lovers heaven!!
But, last year, FOX bought out The SPEED Channel and made it a lame sports channel.
All of the car lovers shows are gone.
But what is worse, is that Fox has spread the coverage of the Barrett-Jackson Collector Car auction over four channels!!
It is a maze of alphabet soup cable channels and without my wife, I would NEVER see anything!
I hate it when people mess with my routine.
I live by my routine.
Routine keeps me in balance.
Without my routine, I get very difficult to be around!
Why do rich, fools, try to change things that were working well before they touched them.
SPEED never seemed to need advertisers.
All their commercial slots were filled.
And not with public service announcements!
But, Fox bought SPEED out and now, Fox Sports runs paid commercials for items that stores would not sell!
I loved watching car rebuilding shows, past races, even lawn mower race events!!
Now, nothing.
I cannot find my car auction unless my wife searches for 10 minutes to find it.
My routine is disrupted and I am not doing well with it.
I realize the world cares very little about me and my issues.
But there must be others that miss SPEED.
Or, maybe it is just because of where I am at the time in life.
But, I remain frustrated, cantankerous, and grumpy, over this intrusion into my television viewing routine!
I know this is LBD related.
I know some of you find it humorous or even funny.
Wait until your routine gets disrupted!
Then you will understand!
And by the way, don't anyone dare move my coffee cup or there WILL be hell to pay!

Today, at the rec center, I ran into one of the few individuals I know with LBD.
He was originally diagnosed with Parkinson's even though his original neurologist thought he had LBD but never did the follow up work to prove his theory.
Because of that, he has gone years without the memory drugs that could have extended his cognitive life.
My friend is just an example of how important a correct diagnosis is.
My neurologist in Virginia Beach, Dr. Mary Bowles, was very tenacious in determining exactly what I had.
She then prescribed Razadyne and Namenda, even before my memory issues became serious.
Later, I read on the Lewy Body Dementia Association website that early use of Arecept or Razadyne and Namenda will extend the cognitive health of LBD patients.
She was truly ahead of her time.
Now, a few years later, the medicines are loosing their effectiveness or the disease is progressing past the impact of the drugs, I don't know which.
But I am grateful for the time that Dr. Bowles bought for me.
My friends wife and I talked today about his recent LBD diagnosis and some of his symptoms.
It seems his hallucinations have increased and she wanted to know if I experienced that issue.
We compared notes about my hallucinations.
Then my friend that I play table tennis with talked about his recent dreams.
He had Parkinson's and that is apparent.
PD does have memory issues in the later state and he is in a progressed state of the disease.
He recently had one of the "Reality" dreams that actually continued into his waking hours.
But it is remarkable how closely LBD and PD relate.
Remember, not to long ago, LBD was called Parkinson's with Dementia!
So, it is no surprise that we have such difficulty correctly diagnosing LBD.
Now, don't get me wrong.
I am not a doctor.
I only know what I have learned about LBD and PD since I first had my problems.
Most is from the Internet.
I realize there is much more correct information that I have not read or don't understand.
But I do know that a correct diagnosis is tantamount to proper drug prescriptions.
And that will extend your cognitive health.

OK, my memory is no longer a perfect thing.
At one time, I had near total recall.
But now, not so much.
When I was in the Navy, I could remember all the technical data for the MK 42 Gun Mounts.
I seldom needed the technical drawings to troubleshoot a malfunction.
Now, I can't follow a simple recipe.
But today, on the way to Church, my wife informed me that over the Christmas Holiday, I had a measurable downturn in my mental capabilities.
Her declaration surprised me because, up to now, I have always know that I had a shift I'm my mental of physical position.
Normally, I tell her and she confirms my statement.
This time, I was surprised and really unaware of my degradation.
I guess that is the next step in this journey called LBD.
Things changing that I do not realize.
It is good that my Wife pays such close attention to my progress.
It is also good that she will tell me because sometimes I can be difficult to convey things too!
We will definitely convey these changes to my neurologist and psychiatrist during the next visits.
As I observe LBD, first hand, it has become apparent that I am not in control and I am not even informed of what is happening or what is around the corner.
I never liked surprises so I find the secretive changes of LBD to be unnerving.
But, there is nothing I can do so there is no reason to get upset.
The vision changes were a surprise to me in that I did not know that was a part of LBD.
OK, I can't know all the issues related to LBD.
But mental changes that I did not see?
That is another issue all together.
So, as I have done since the beginning, I inform all of you.
This is quite a journey into the unknown.
I remember President Reagan's letter about his Alzheimer's.
He said he was on a journey into the unknown.
He was right.

<doc date=Saturday, January 11, 2014>
My mind stays in the past most of the time.
It seems I am very comfortable in my Active Duty Navy days.
I told my wife tonight that I actually feel like I am still on active duty!
Last Veteran's Day, I wore my Dress Blues to Church and I felt like I never took them off.
Most times I go to sleep, I dream of my active duty days.
Deployments, gun shoots, standing watches, going on liberty.
Yes, I know I am not on active duty at this moment.
But my mind goes there when I am tired, stressed, or alone.
But I have never done anything as personally satisfying as being on Active Duty in the United States Navy.
So, if that is where my demented mind goes, I will be happy.
Even where we live is different in my mind.
I know we live in the Panhandle of Florida.
Yet, my mind spends a large amount of time back in the Tidewater area of Virginia.
I experience the traffic issues going to the base.
I see the ships at the pier, and I experience the fellowship of the Chief's Mess.
I dream of shipmates that have passed away and wake up needing to call them!
I am actually living in two different places.
I wonder how long that will last?
How long will I know the reality of today?
I have had the feeling that my LBD is going to speed up it's progression.
I don't know why I have that feeling, but I do.
My dreams have taken over my mental activity.
My speech is more stilted and I have more problems finding the correct words to use.
Mostly, I do not know what date it is or even what day many times.
I loose track of the dogs and I feel abandoned when I am home alone.
So, there has been some change.
I also get very frustrated when my Wife corrects me or directs me to do something.
I feel like I am being treated with disrespect.
It is how my brain is working right now.
She is not being disrespectful, she is being caring.
But, when the issue happens, I have all I can to to keep my temper.
Again, I have written about that recently.
LBD is a confusing, brutal, disease.
It scrambles your brain, your emotions, and your reality!!
You loose the stability to walk independently and it causes even the automatic functions of your body to malfunction!
But what may be the most damaging is the effect LBD has on our relationships!
I am not the person I once was.
I now need care.
I do not take the lead on issues like budget or outings.
And i am getting cantankerous!
I often tell people that the good part of LBD is that I forget what bothered me.
That is true.
But when I do remember what bothers me, I get depressed.
Maybe I will concentrate on forgetting more!

I have noticed that I am not seeing as clearly or crisply as I was just recently.
I had my eyed examined about two years ago and there was little change in me prescription.
But like I said, I have noticed a marked degradation in my vision.
So, off to the Internet I went to see if this was related to LBD or just old age vision issues.
The answer surprised me.
It seems, LBD does impact vision.
So do other forms of dementia but to a lesser degree.
It seems the vision change is a part of the change caused by the degradation of the autonomic functions of the brain.
The part of the brain that controls body heat levels, blood pressure, causes or regulates constipation, and other automatic body functions.
Since I am not a neurologist and know little about how the brain functions, I was surprised that vision was an automatic function.
But, it makes sense now.
It seems that the vision impacts come in the areas of color recognition, shape definition, depth perception, and facial recognition.
For instance, my wife was showing me something I did not recognize and asking me if it was OK.
I could not recognize it, even though I was sitting right next to her.
When she passed it to me to hold, I recognized it as one of those round cheese snacks, Baby Bell, that come in the plastic case.
Until I held it, I did not know what shape color, or substance it was.
It was a blob to me.
I have not seen the depth perception issue yet, but I am less stable on my feet and seem to wobble when I reach for something.
So, maybe I am experiencing depth perception issues and don't recognize it.
I have always had a color deficiency issue.
So, that one will have to get really bad for it to impact me.
Just the same, I do not see as good as I did even a couple of months ago.
I will probably go see and Ophthalmologist soon.
But I don't look forward to that since most eye doctors can't even spell Lewy Body Dementia.
My patience with doctors has become strained and that is why I am reticent to make that move.
I would almost rather just deal with the vision issue.
We will see.
I wanted to get this issue out since I believe there are more of you that have the same vision issues I do.
If you are a care giver, it may make your spouses life better if you can improve their vision.

We are approaching 41 years of marriage.
We have a very happy, maybe even exceptional, marriage.
Our relationship is based on respect and openness.
I do not argue with my wife.
I do not yell at my wife.
Maybe I should since holding in anger is not healthy, but I don't.
I was listening to a radio talk show this morning.
It was a legal ask the expert show.
A fellow was being evicted from his apartment because he had heated, loud, arguments with his wife.
The fellow said he was handicapped but did not reveal what handicap he had.
The show host said; "everyone yells at their wife."
I thought, not me!
Now, there are times when I earn her wrath and while she does not yell loudly, I know when she is frustrated with me.
Many times, I disagree with the reason I was chastised, but I hold my tongue and remain quiet.
Why, because arguing is counterproductive!
This is one of those nights when I am upset, tired, and don't want to go to bed.
Both dogs wonder when I am going to bed.
Yet, here I am pondering how I got here and where I am going.
I just answered an email from a woman whose husband has LBD and she wanted some info on how the disease impacts me.
I tried to describe the impact of LBD in physical areas.
But I did not describe the personal frustration that I feel being diminished mentally and physically.
My wife and I ad a discussion about moving into a Continuing Care Retirement Community.
It is a good idea for us, yet I cannot settle on the decision.
Heck, I can't settle on any decision.
I used to be decisive and a Leader!
Now, I can't or don't want to make any decisions.
My mind cannot sort out the pros and cons.
My emotions run my mind.
Emotions, not facts, would drive my decisions if I let them.
Instead, I defer decisions.
Why, because I fell if I make a decision it will be the wrong one.
I am not who I was before LBD.
For instance, I never took anything from anyone.
I tried to be honest and as even tempered as I could be,  But I was not going to take a chewing out if I did not deserve it.
Now, it is different.
People who are diminished by a disease like LBD are not treated with respect.
Sometimes people tray us with pity or curiosity.
But seldom do they tree us with respect.
That is another reason we hide our disease.
My Father in Law had Alzheimer's and he and his wife hid it for years.
When she died, he was lost and it finally became apparent he had Alzheimer's.
There were no treatments of drugs at that time.
No one knew what to do with an Alzheimer's patient.
I am blessed that there has been a monumental jump in meds and treatment, including institutional help and care.
I don't want to argue, be yelled at, or be treated disrespectfully.
Everything is not my fault.
But, I won't say it or defend myself.
I don't want to hurt feelings or bruise egos, even though that is what happens to me.
turn about is not fair play.
This has been a rambling post of emotions.
I thought about deleting it.
But, it is good to get these emotions out and to let others know what goes on in my LBD mind.
If you only knew the confusion, anger, and depression that lived inside me.
I would like to scream and punch the walls.
But that would cause me issues that I do not want.
So, I will quietly sit here and express my emotions.
Hoping they will depart soon.
But like pain, my constant companion, they won't depart.
Instead, they will stay and frustrate me more.
LBD is becoming a pain that no pill can diminish.

I am very happy that this is the end of the year and tomorrow marks the end of the Holidays.
Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed Christmas.
Family, friends, good food, and decorations.
Yet, from my youth, Christmas has never been a happy time for me.
I get depressed, feel disconnected,  feel unwanted, and anxious.
I have bad memories about Christmas past from my youth.
Yet, Christmas is when I officially proposed to my wife.
I met her on a blind date on Thanksgiving Day and we got engaged on Christmas.
She is my other half.
She completed me, helped me to grow, and taught me to really love and enjoy life.
So, Christmas has some good memories.
Just the same, the Christmas holidays stress me.
There is so much to do and it is all so temporary.
And New Year celebrations are just a reason to get drunk!
Which is something I quit many years ago, thank God!
So, I am very happy that this time of the year is done.
Since I have been diagnosed with LBD, I have tried to find positive things in everyday.
This is how I deal with the effects of LBD.
I can laugh at my memory failures.
Snicker at my imbalances and falls.
And even be amazed at my loss of muscle mass.
I say that my legs are "unhappy" when they hurt every evening.
And I even understand my body temperature swings and constipation issues.
But my emotions still confuse me.
While I can laugh at my issues, I still get severely depressed over things that should not effect me.
For instance, Christmas cards.
We send cards to friends and family and we do not get return cards.
I realize people are busy, mail gets lost, and things happen.
Yet, we make an effort to contact people that are important to us and they act like they don't care.
Silly, I know, but it is how my mind works.
One of the most cherished things in my life are friends.
I have everything I need.
If I find something I want, I buy it.
But friends, true, loyal, friends cannot be bought.
They are a gift from God!
LBD is a disease with a blessing.
Dementia makes your short term memory fail.
Later in the disease, long term memory fails.
In the middle of the disease, your autonomic functions begin to fail.
The loss of short term memory is a blessing in that the things the depress me, upset me, and disappoint me, I forget, quickly.
While I am depressed today, I will forget why, tomorrow.
There I go again, finding positives among the problems.

Being able to write about my journey is a lifeline for me.
There are stresses, fears, and frustrations, that I can express in writing but not openly in discussion.
It is like I am writing to a very close friend!
That may be weird to some of you, but it is therapy for me.
It is also a connection to a support group.
Many times, you reply wit encouragement, suggestions, or even criticism.
Each reply is welcomed and cherished.
It is like family or close friends trying to help!
I have been blessed with the ability to express what is going on as I go down the LBD road.
Many LBD patients cannot do that, and I am sorry for them.
Maybe they need encouraged or enabled to blog.
That is what my wife did for me.
I would have never ventured on this journey without her enabling me.
Now, I write all the time.
I have also made some friends and compatriots in the LBD community through blogging.
That is a big benefit of being open about this disease.
So, I thank each one of you and I pray that you are all doing as well as you can.
You will always be in my thoughts and prayers.

Lewy Body Dementia is the second most prevalent form of Dementia following Alzheimer's.
Yet few Doctors know much about it and the public is all but ignorant of the disease.
I have an acquaintance at the local recreation center that had been diagnosed with Parkinson's.
He does have some of the Parkinson's symptoms, but not the shaking.
But his short term memory os nonexistent.
I just heard that he finally has a confirmed diagnosis of LBD.
I am happy the neurologist finally came to a decision.
In this gentleman's case, the neurologist has not prescribed the most effective Alzheimer's drugs and therefore, he has not experienced the benefits that I have.
Maybe now, he will start taking Arecept and Namenda and I hope they at least slow his mental decline.
Getting an accurate diagnosis is required to receive the correct medicines.
But it is even more important than that.
With an accurate diagnosis, you are first in line for new medicines that are compounded to help your specific condition.
Treating someone with LBD with the standard Parkinson's drugs is useless.
For instance, Sinemet does not work for the rigidity and instability caused by LBD.
Yet, neurologists constantly give those drugs to us!
I am lucky that my neurologist here in Florida realized that.
Now, my stomach is not upset all the time!
But I spent a long time with the dry heaves from Sinemet!
I have been blessed in my LBD journey because I had neurologists in Virginia and here in Florida that actually understood LBD.
But I have also had a couple of neurologists that found not even spell Lewy Body Dementia!!
It is terribly frustrating to have something wrong that your Doctor can not understand, well enough diagnose.
Again, I am glad this gentleman has finally received a definitive diagnosis.
But LBD is a difficult diseases because of it's ups and downs.
One day you feel pretty good and the next day, you are worse than you ever have been.
At least, with an accurate diagnosis, we can get the best treatment for our disease.

I have a lot of confusion and indecision about our future living plans.
I have written before about us being on the waiting list to move into a Continuing Care Retirement Community (CCRC) here in Pensacola.
It is a great facility with a wonderful reputation and track record.
Their financial balance sheet is healthy.
Just the same, there is a significant initial outlay and there is a stout monthly fee.
That is the price of future security.
There are facilities that do not require an up front fee, but they do not offer any future care guarantees.
You are at the mercy of the fees at the time you need the care.
In a CCRC, your monthly outlay does not go up when one or both of you require assisted living or professional care.
That is what you are purchasing with your initial outlay and your high monthly payments.
Sort of like the old FRAM oil filter commercial; "You can pay me now, or you can pay me later!"
However, I am becoming reticent to move at all.
I am becoming very secure in my surroundings and the idea of moving frightens me!
When we discuss the move and the size of our Apartment, I become quiet and frightened.
And this was always my idea!
But now, any change unnerves me.
We worked very hard all of our married life.
We saved very diligently, both worked most of the time, and did not live too far above our means.
We could have saved more I suppose, but we wanted to have some fun along the way too, and we did.
The initial outlay will take about one-third of our savings.
That idea frightens me too.
However, staying in our home has known and unknown expenses that can deplete savings quickly.
So, I realize there is no perfect living situation.
I like the idea of renting, because I do not have the responsibility of any maintenance.
And in the Panhandle of Florida, both is permanent thanks to Hurricanes!
So the home you love may not be there next year!
And the CCRC we are on the waiting list for is on high ground and made of cement.
It has withstood a Cat 4 Hurricane and survived with little damage.
So, it is a good candidate for storm survival.
What really bothers me is moving, change, costs, initial outlay, and did I say change?!
I also question the need to make this move.
I am doing pretty good right now, I think.
Maybe I am too close to make a correct estimation of where I am.
But the neurologist is useless.
My psychiatrist want me is Assisted Living right now!
And I know I don't need that level of care.
Do I?!
I have had problems making decisions for quite a while.
I just can't settle on any decision!
My wife is very good at looking at the pros and cons of any decision.
Through our marriage, I have made good decisions and some bad ones.
My weaknesses have been cars and houses.
We have owned seven houses and a mobile home.
Most of them I made money on.
All of them were good for the time we were in them.
But now, moving out of the, most probably, the last home we will own is a decision I cannot make.
So, the best thing I can to is trust my wife's decision making and try to not come apart mentally as we get closer to our next, and final, move.
While I feel somewhat better as I described in my last post, I also know that mentally I am not able to deal wit changes is my routine or living conditions.
I hope that once we are settled the new place will be my place of security.
Right now, I am up in the air.

The fact is that LBD is s roller coaster ride or feeling good and bad.
Symptoms get better and even seem to disappear and then, BAM!
You are much worse than you have ever been.
So I am very reticent to say that I feel much better.
I have been down this road before and I know what's coming.
Just the same, it feels great to be on the upswing.
I was discussing this with my Wife as we drove home from our weekly Bible study at the local Assisted Living Facility.
There have been a couple of changes in my life.
First, at the direction of my GP, I have lost over 50 pounds!
I now wear 36 inch waist trousers.
I was tight in 40's!
I actually tried on 35 in Wranglers and they fit great.
But I bought 36's because Jeans shrink!
Another change is the addition of a new miniature poodle in our home.
She is almost 13 years old and her parents died recently.
Their children did not want her and the caregiver is a friend of our Daughter in Law.
We met her and immediately adopted her.
She has fit into our family.
Marcel the Wonder Dog loves having a sister.
They seem to be buddies already.
She has been to the Vet and received a remarkable report.
While she needs some dental work, she is very healthy!
We have both fallen in love with her and all four of us are settling in well.
These two changes may be the reason for my recent upswing, or not.
It is hard to tell.
My energy levels are up a bit.
My strength is still not there, and my short term memory is poor, but I feel better.
I feel like the gloom has lifted!
It is amazing!
It may also be the happiness of the Christmas season!
Our home is decorated and family plans are all made.
My Wife is planning to make her specialty pies and all the presents are wrapped.
The joy of the season permeates my being.
Christmas is the celebration of the beginning of God's Perfect Plan to bridge the gap between sinful mankind and Himself.
Jesus Christ stepped into the stream of humanity as a child to be Crucified, Dead, Buried, and Resurrected 33 years later , to pay the price, once and for all, to purchase us,you and me, out of the chains of the slavery of sin!
Now that is a reason to celebrate and feel great!
SO, while this may not last long, I will cherish it as long as I can.
After all, it's Christmas!

I once quoted the Poem by Robert Frost; "Stopping by a Woods on a Snowy Evening" in an early post on this blog.
A friend that I worked with at the time, who was having his own battle with a terminal disease came to me and said; "After I read your post, I thought you were going to commit suicide!"
I told him, no.
I was fine.
Barry died last year after a long battle with cancer.
He fought for normalcy up to the end.
He worked far longer than he should have, yet work was his normalcy.
So, in retrospect, he did things right.
Suicide is something no one wants to discuss.
The neurologist I owe my long time existence too used to ask me, every visit, if I was suicidal.
I always told he no.
Once she asked me if I was suicidal and I replied, no.
She then asked me if I was homicidal, I told her; "No, I liked women!"
She laughed!
And that was good because she seldom smiled, well enough laughed.
But suicide is not a laughing matter.
I cannot tell you that I have not considered suicide because I have.
If you will be honest with yourself, most of you have too.
In that difficult time,  probably as a teenager or young adult, when all seemed too bleak, you thought about it for a moment.
Then, you decided suicide made no sense, and you were correct!
If you are a true Christian.
A faithful follower of Jesus Christ, suicide is probably repulsive to you.
Why, because God gave us life!
Then, because we were sinners, he enacted His perfect plan for our salvation, the birth, life, death, torture, Crucifixion, death, burial, resurrection, and accent ion, of Jesus Christ!
Our Savior defeated death once and for all!
Since we do not have the power or the right to start life, we do not have the power or right to end our own life.
One of the Ten Commandments says;  "Thou shalt not murder."
It does not say thou shalt not kill!
There is a difference.
Murder is taking an innocent life.
Killing is what soldiers do and that is covered in the Old and New Testament were we are told to follow our leaders and they will be held accountable for the actions they order us t do.
Suicide is murder.
Self murder!
Just the same, I can understand fully, how someone, in an impossible situation, facing pain and suffering much greater that he or she can endure alone, may decide to end their life.
It is an action that I cannot judge.
"Judge not, lest you be judged."
For those of us with LBD, decisions come hard.
In my personal life, I was once very decisive.
Now, I have difficulties deciding when to go to the bathroom!
And sometimes, I get than decision wrong!
For instance, a few months ago, we decided to place our names on the waiting list for a local Continuing Care Retirement Community.
Both of us agreed, but now, I am having second thoughts.
Why,  costs, the act of moving somewhere again, what to do with all our possessions that won't fit in our new place, the thought of giving up what little independence I have, and most of all, the idea that moving there cements the fact that I will never get better.
It is the final move, the beginning of the end.
The point of no return.
So, Robert Frost's poem again has meaning to me.
While I fantasize that I have "miles to go before I sleep."
reality tells me different and that depresses me.
Depression leads me to deep, dark, thoughts.
And those thoughts inevitably lead to speeding up the process.
If the endgame is death, and if I am only going to get worse, why no bypass the next downturn and just end this now?!
But then, my mind shifts focus to things I still want to do.
My wife, son, grandsons, family and friends that I love to be with.
I am not afraid of death because Jesus has already defeated death.
"In the twinkling of an eye" after I take my last breath, I will be in the presents of the Lord in Heaven.
I have no fear!
But, I don't want to have the sin of murdering myself as the first topic the Lord brings up!
So, I will stay here until God calls me home.
He has work for me to do and I will do my best to accomplish that work.
If you are suicidal, or homicidal, don't hide it.
Talk to someone, your Pastor, your doctor, you spouse, a friend, or even the suicide Hot Line!
Talk it out!
Put your emotions and feelings out there for all to see.
Don't hide your pain like I do.
Why, because your friends and family can help you bear that pain, if you permit them too.

We have discussed this before, yet as I sit here ready to explode, I thought it would be therapeutic for me to discuss this again.
I have felt frail since I woke up this morning.
Unable to focus, diminished vision, weak muscles, and instability.
My memory is foggy and I feel generally diminished.
This accounts for the down portion of this posting.
We took a long walk today because it was 75 degrees out and very pleasant.
We walked at a brisk pace and completed 3.2 miles in 59 minutes.
A good pace for two folks over 62!
We enjoyed the view of our surrounding neighborhood and the nature that lives in this area of Florida.
When we returned home, I was exhausted, in a good way.
But, as we relaxed, I became frail feeling again.
Finally, I decided to take a nap.
Not a new thing.
But the urgency to take a nap was new.
So, I went to bed and slept for 3 hours.
I awoke, suddenly and in somewhat of a confused state.
I had a violent dream and actually woke myself up punching my pillow.
Not a good way to wake up.
The staccato stress of the Holidays, is difficult to deal with.
Actually, anything out of my normal routine upsets me most of the time.
OK, all of the time.
It is confusion because I enjoy the outings and Linda does a great job limiting our social schedule.
But, as I have wrote before, it is the planning of any event that stresses me more than the event itself.
The running around planning, making things, packing things, setting up schedules, drives me up the wall.
I would be much better if I was just told, an hour before the event, to shower and get dressed to go out.
When I do my studies for the Bible Study we lead at our local assisted living facility, I do that study and preparation the night before the study!
This takes away the pre-stress and also has the study fresh in my mind for the next day.
I truly enjoy the Bible study because I enjoy the people in the study.
Both the preparation and event are controlled on my timing.
It is much like meals, getting ready for meal and cleaning up after a meal is torture for me.
Now, I am better here if I do the clean up.
Why, because it is done at my pace.
I am in control and alone in the kitchen, lost in my thoughts.
So, as we rush towards Christmas, I need to find a way to decompress and relax.
I need to concentrate on the fun and fellowship of the event and not the stress of the preparation.
So, as we learn to manage this disease,  I need to be more open with my frustrations and fears.

Thanksgiving is over and Christmas is 24 days away, I can feel the stress growing already!
We do our best to reduce holiday stress.
We decorated the house already, all the Christmas shopping is done, and our party planner is kept purposely empty.
We also do our best not to be out after dark, because I do not do well in the dark!
But there is still stress that comes naturally with the season.
I really do not know how to deal with that.
We try to keep our routine intact.
That helps me.
But there are stressors that lurk in the decorations!
We change many things inout home with the decorations of Christmas.
Familiar items are put away  to make room for treasured momentous.
We have some precious ornaments that are now displayed on a small wire tree.
I knocked the tree over and onto the floor the other day trying to operate a wall switch!
I broke a Lennox Cross that has been with us forever!
I felt horrible!
I apologized many times and my wife is being very understanding over this.
The accident is the result of my rigidity and loss of vision from LBD.
We both know that, but it still frustrates me and causes extreme stress for me!
I am sure there will be other issues caused by LBD.
This is the first of the year!
And the incident set a negative tone for me.
Hopefully, I will forget it soon.
That is also a benefit of LBD!
But we will be ever vigilant to reduce stress this Christmas season.

Yes, there ARE benefits to having a degenerative neurological disease that is fatal, you do things you probably would not have done!
Today, at the Gulf Coast Alabama Zoo, we had the wonderful opportunity to spend 30 minutes with two beautiful tiger cubs.
They were Bengal Tiger cubs, three months old, and full of energy, wonder, and mischief!
The Zoo uses "animal encounters" to raise support since the Zoo is self supporting.
My Wife, Son, Daughter in Law and two of my three Grandsons were in a private area with a professional from the Zoo and a male and female cub.
The were BIG!
They had BIG paws, teeth,  weighed 30 pounds, and plenty of strength.
They loved playing with their prospective food, humans!
The loved to chew and lick.
If you got on the flow and layer down, they loved to walk on your back, lick you hair, chew on you, and play as only Tigers can.
They bite necks, legs, butts, and in my case, ears!
Not hard bites, but playful bites to see your reaction.
It was just plain fun.
And for someone who grew up next to "Jungle Larry's" first exhibit at Puritas Springs Park on Puritas Avenue on the west side of Cleveland, it was a dream come true!
I have always loved animals and encounters like this excite me and give me great pleasure.
In the past, I may not have agreed to spend the money to experience this, but now, I have learned to take advantage of opportunities when the present themselves.
I have known individuals in similar circumstances as mine who still don't take advantage of fun and exciting opportunities.
They are saving their money for something that may happen in the future.
And I agree with holding some back for that unknown event.
But, life is short, so if I can, I will.
Now, I am extremely exhausted from the drive to and from, and the event.
My legs hurt and I am having trouble moving around.
But it was well worth the pain.
So, I will sleep in tomorrow morning,  and then, I will begin looking for another life experience to try!

Before we left Virginia, I had an appointment with a neurologist that was new to my doctor's practice.
She was young, just out of her residency, and full of new knowledge, looking for someone to use it on.
After a short time of talking, she told me that I had not YET come to terms with my disease.
I disagreed with her, loudly.
Now, a couple of years later, I can say that she was right!
I can now say that I am fully engaged with my Lewy Body Dementia.
It is forefront in my thoughts and it fills my days with reminders that LBD is here to stay.
In the beginning of this journey, I looked at my disease as though I was looking at someone else dealing with it.
Now, I see it in the first person.
I also used to say;  "If you have to have a disease, this is a good one to have, because you forget the bad parts."
That is no longer true and I don't say that anymore.
I believe this is the middle innings of this journey and the stakes have increased!
I think continuously about the past.
Friends, events, places, things I did wrong, and unfullfilled dreams.
There comes a point in this journey when you realize, it is over!
You have done all that you will accomplish.
No more new mountains to climb or challenges to win.
Your legacy is already written and the ink is dry.
That's not a bad thing.
It is true that I have now accepted the totality of Lewy Body Dementia.
But there are some things I wanted to do that I just never did.
For instance, I always wanted to be a survivalist.
Live on a large piece of property, off the grid, growing the majority of what I ate, making my own electricity, totally independent from society.
My thoughts in the evening still go to my concrete house, on 25 acres, with solar and wind mill electricity, no phone, television, computer, or neighbors.
But you and I know that will never happen.
Another exceptional blogger who is a caregiver for her husband who has LBD, wrote an early blog about her husband purchasing a new pick up truck with all the bells and whistles!
It was shiny, chrome covered, and beautiful.
He dented it the first day he had it!
That truck was most likely his dream and he was going to fulfill it, at least for a day.
I also knew of a retired Naval Officer who was diagnosed with terminal cancer.
He always wanted a Corvette.
So, he went and bought a brand new Corvette.
Drove it home, parked it in the garage and never drove it again.
He died less than a month later.
But, he had his Corvette.
For someone on a journey like mine, that unfulfilled dream haunts us.
Work, family, responsibilities, saving for the unknown future retirement, saving for security, all take precedence over paying for dreams.
We work crazy hours, to pay for things we don't want, to satisfy the needs and wants of the ones we love.
Most men sacrifice their dreams for family and security.
But in the end, I never knew someone who said; "I wish I would have worked longer or harder."
In the end, we realize that money does not purchase happiness or security.
It does not satisfy our inner needs.
It is dreams that fill our thoughts with happiness and pleasure.
And even though I will never have my concrete survival home, every night I go there and lock the door before I go to sleep.

Since we moved to Florida, I don't get to see my Navy buddies from the Tidewater Area of Virginia and other places around the country.
Many of them still work and travel is not an option.
I fully understand that.
But telephone calls keep me going!
Every week I spend at least and hour on the phone with my best friend Jerry!
We discuss anything and everything.
His calls rebuild my moral ands my spirits.
I have another friend from the USS Stein days that calls me at least once a month.
CJ and I talk about our exploits and old friends.
I look forward to his calls.
I get monthly calls from one of eh Supervisors that I worked with for 20 years in civil service.
Steve and I enjoy a special connection from our work days as well as with my disease since his Father had Alzheimer's.
Other friends call less frequent, but their calls are just as precious to me.
I remember when I was on active duty and deploying on a regular basis.
Telephone calls home, to hear my wife's voice, to talk about home, was the best, sweetest, thing I had.
Back in those days, long distance, overseas calls were VERY expensive.
But we did not care.
It was our lifeline!
Well, today, calls from friends and relatives in still my lifeline.
With LBD, it is easy to get overwhelmed with the emotion of; "No one cares about me anymore".
Depression, is a real issue, even if I deny it.
But a call from a friend is just the medicine to cure the depression blues.
To hear how everyone at work is doing, or how the last Gun Show was, is a salve to my damages psyche.
I still check out the local news on Hamptonroads.com first thing, every morning.
I check the weather report, and the obituaries too.
I need to stay connected to home.
I know it is easy to forget an friend or relative that is some distance away and impacted by a disease.
They are out of sight and out of mind.
Yes, you send them a Christmas card.
Yes, you think about them is they come up in a conversation.
And you probably tell one of their jokes or sea stories every once in a while.
But they never know that because you never call.
Email is nice, but your voice is the medicine we need.
The only thing better would be a visit.
But as with me, work always comes first.
I understand that.
The few times a month that I am home alone, I never have the television or radio on.
I enjoy the quiet, and I want to be able to hear the telephone ring so I don't miss a call from a friend.

Today, I had an outing planned.
The person that I wanted to go on that outing with could not make it.
So, because I can no longer drive alone, I did not go either.
I suppose that's the way it goes.
My Dad used to say that he hated to make plans because when they happened the event was anticlimactic and if it did not happen, he was disappointed.
I am beginning to understand what Dad meant.
Older adults are treated as burdens in our society.
Our infirmities are looked on as an inconvenience to the young.
Even the Affordable Care Act penalizes the young to help the elderly.
How long will it be before the premise of the movie "Soilent Green" becomes real?
If you do not know about this movie, find it and watch it.
It is much like Orwell's "1984".
But folks with experience, and you don't get experience until you are old, have much to offer if the young would only listen.
But alas, they don't.
I wish so much, that I had listened more to my Dad and learned more from him.
I had more time with him than many other young people do.
But it was not enough!
Now, I long for his sage advice and teaching stories.
No computer, blog, book, or recording can ever replace one on one discussions with a person of experience.
Instead, Marcel the Wonder Dog and I sit in my power recliner and lament our situation.
I once knew an older person who told their children; "If you don't come see me now, don't bother coming to my funeral!"
That was a difficult pill to swallow then, but I understand the sentiment behind the statement.
When we are young, we are in a hurry and we tolerate nothing or no one that will slow us down.
Career, interests, friends, love, excitement, all come first.
Then, we get old, and all of the things that kept our attention seem to fade away.
And, because we did not take time to build relationships, we are alone, wondering what went wrong.
A friend sent me an email the other day that had this saying on the bottom;  "We grow too soon old, and too late wise."
How true it is.

I received a comment today from a reader that asked me if I had good and bad days.
The short answer is yes.
This is a cardinal symptom of Lewy Body Dementia.
But I actually experience changes from good to bad or bad to good during the day.
This morning, when I woke up, I felt like there was nothing wrong with me.
We had Marcel the Wonder Dog groomed this morning and then headed to the Commissary to do our grocery shopping.
Halfway through the Commissary, I was confused, tired, and disoriented.
That passed later in the afternoon, however, I am now experiencing my sundowning issues.
I have written before that I almost hate the good times because I know a bad time is just around the corner.
The roller coaster ride of LBD is most aggravating.
Another question related to stability.
I use a cane often as a stabilizer.
I also have a rotolator that I use for longer walks and outings.
In the house, I stubbornly refuse to use my cane.
I have fallen but normally I just stumble or wobble.
I guess I am like a Weeble!
My mobility issues are rigidity, mostly in my legs at the moment.
As I understand it, my "Push and Pull" muscles are fighting with each other.
My muscles normally feel like I have just completed a marathon!
They are sore, tender, and stiff.
The rigidity is moving to my arms and my lower back.
This rigidity effects my balance especially in a slippery or uneven surface.
LBD impacts many functions.
Memory, hallucinations, balance, even your feeling of safety and well being.
I often say this is a good disease to have because I forget the bad parts.
But, it is also a difficult disease to have considering all the parts of your life it effects.
The last part of the comment related to professional care.
My wife and I know there will come a time when I am too difficult to care for.
She cannot life me out of bed now, so if I am unable to get up, we would be in trouble.
The reality is, most of us with LBD will require professional care.
Most of that care is provided in a Nursing Home or Memory Support Unit.
We are presently on the waiting list to move into a Continuing Care Retirement Community that provides independent living and all levels of assisted living including professional care.
Planning ahead is the best way.
Of course, sometimes LBD moves faster than you can plan.
We are blessed that my journey is somewhat slow at this time.
I have said it before, those of you who read and comment on this blog are my support group.
I love to read your comments and hopefully, provide you some insight into my journey.
As Red Skelton used to say;  Keep this cards and letters coming!
Thanks.

Those of us who are in the first half of our journey with Lewy Body Dementia, still seek out the pleasures of life.
Food, travel, companionship, hobbies, intimate relations, all still bring us pleasure.
I love to eat.
However, my Doctor has put me on a reduced carb diet.
It has worked wonderfully.
I have lost 45 pounds so far and my Triglycerides and blood sugar are now well with in normal specifications!
Does this mean I don't eat what I like?
No, I just eat less of it.
For instance, tonight, we decided we wanted Cheese sandwiches and tomato soup for dinner.
How did we do it?
We each had one toasted cheese sandwich on lower carb bread than our old favorite, Milton's Bead.
We made the tomato soup with water instead of milk.
It was great.
We have learned that I do much better if we connect with friends, nature, and ourselves.
We walk for exercise, enjoy Church, shopping, and family outings.
While I want to sit in my recliner, alone, I am much better if we do something interactive, interesting, different.
Interaction challenges the brain.
While I ride in the car more than drive, I still enjoy being out and around.
I am interested in what helps you feel better.
I am always open to learning from other with more experience than me.
So let me know!

<doc date=Tuesday, November 12, 2013>
Many times, especially in the evening, I tell my wife that I feel like I am not here!
I have a feeling of being far off, distant, disconnected, and not engaged.
I will stare off into space and see nothing.
The television will be on, but I do not hear the program.
I am mentally not in the room.
It has also happened when I am riding in the car, mostly in the back seat.
My wife and son are in the front seat having a discussion, and I am in the back seat, in my own world.
This is a common issue for those of us with LBD, but it is very unnerving for us who actually suffer from this issue.
If it were not for the clock with a calendar that sits on the television stand, I would never know the day or date.
In my defense, being retired, I have six Saturdays and a Sunday.
So the days mean very little.
But there are days that we need to be somewhere, like a doctor's appointment!
So knowing what day it is, IS important.
Being able to express how these symptoms impact and effect me is a blessing, for my family and I hope for those of you who read my blog.
When my wife and my neurologist in Norfolk, Virginia encouraged me to start this blog, they both wanted me to express how I was dealing with this disease.
The idea was to get me to look at my disease honestly.
It has worked.
In the beginning, I had a "Third party" view of my disease.
I used to look at myself as if I was out of my body and looking at someone else.
Now, I know it is me and I view my issues as my issues, not someone else's.
I know this sounds strange, but it is exactly how I have progressed through this journey.
In the stages of Grief, I am now in the acceptance stage.
I have LBD, it will not get better, and it will get worse!
I never would say that in the beginning.
I always thought, deep, down, inside that I could beat this disease.
Much like the surgery took my colon tumor away.
Well, I now know that is a fantasy and I am in this for life.
So, while I feel disconnected much of the time, I really do know what I am facing.
But it is the disease that causes me to be detached from my surroundings.
Another issue to deal with.
</doc>
<doc date=Monday, November 11, 2013>
There is little information available about our disease.
WEBMD does a fairly good job giving the basics, but there is no other place to find first hand information that the LBD association site.
Not only do they give good, up to date , information.
But the offer a place to communicate between care givers and also those of us effected by LBD.
I encourage everyone impacted by this disease to check out this site.
They also provide information on the most recent developments in research on this disease.
It has always amazed me that LBD is the second most diagnosed form of Dementia yet no one ever heard of it.
I have dealt with doctors that do not know what LBD is!
So I believe those of us who are impacted by LBD should get the word out also.
I would like to see more networking within the LBD community.
More workshops, more local support groups, and more one on one support between LBD patients and caregivers.
Something like the Alcoholics Anonymous program.
Why, because someone newly diagnosed with LBD needs to talk to someone who has had the disease for a while.
We need first had answers and support from someone who knows what is going to happen.
That type of first hand knowledge will go a long way to mitigate fear and stress.
I seem to spend much of my time trying to figure out why something is happening to me.
Yes, I know it is caused by the disease.
But what stage am I in?
And yes, I understand I am getting worse, but, is the latest change expected?
Do most LBD sufferers have tis issue?
My neurologist is of little help.
My psychiatrist is better equipped to deal with questions, but I still do not get the answers I need.
There is the LBD patient I see at the local rec center.
He and I trade issues and understanding and I find my infrequent conversations with him my best help.
So, check out the LBD association web site and then, get the word out.
And thanks for your comments.
The information I get from each of you is precious medicine to me.
I get information that lets me know I am "Normal" for having LBD!

When you have Lewy Body Dementia, every day is a fight!
You fight to maintain some resemblance of being normal.
You struggle to do things.
You struggle to hold your temper when the night brings the angry and agitation.
Now I have to struggle with my doctors and CVS Pharmacy on who writes which prescription.
Since we moved to Florida, my prescriptions have been in constant turmoil which causes major stress for my wife and me.
Frankly, I am tired of the fight!
I have complained before that there is no on to help those of us impacted by LBD or any other dementia.
Each one of us is on our own to fight the many conflicts that arise.
We have no organization, business,  or individual to turn too for help and advocacy.
Again, I hear you saying;  "Why don't you start one?"
I am busy enough trying not to pee in my pants well enough start an organization or fight with a pharmacy or doctor's office.
This is the place where I begin to think I would be better off in a Memory Support unit or in an Assisted Living Facility where they deal with my fights.
Of course, I am not ready for that, yet.
But it is a tempting proposition.
If you are a care taker, you have my everlasting respect.
I know my wife is burdened with a tremendous amount of responsibility and the stress that goes with that.
I really cannot help that much.
The best thing I can do is stay out of the way.
So, the fight goes on.
Right now, LBD is winning.
I suspect it will stay in the lead until the end.

Monday night, I went to bed at 6:30PM!!
Why, because I felt myself getting angry and mean and I knew bed was the best place for me.
I could escape to my mental safe place there.
Quiet, dark, alone, and able to think about things that soothe me.
I have written before about sundowning.
This has been a continuing issue for me.
There are certain things that now upset me more than ever and when that happens, combined with the sundowning, the best place is bed.
Yes, I could stay up and express my anger and frustration.
But for what purpose?
I will only anger my wife/care giver.
And that is never good.
I may have LBD but I am not stupid, at least not yet!
Where and when did I learn that bed was a safe place?
When I was 12.
It was Christmas eve, a particularly tense time in my life.
All Christmas eves were tense and there was much sniping going on in the house, so, I went to bed at about 7 PM.
I did not tell my Mom or Dad, I just went to bed!
They missed me eventually, and even came up and checked on me.
But, I was asleep, safe, in my own thoughts.
My wife still does not understand that I react more to things that bother me.
For instance, money issues, or political issues.
I would be much better off if I never watch a political news show again.
As far as finances go,  it would be better for me if that topic never came up.
I have no control over finances, so why even tell me about where the money is going.
My opinion does not matter now.
So I sit in my recliner and boil slowly.
My blood pressure rises as my anger increases.
But I try very hard to hold my tongue and to keep quiet.
Expressing my anger is counterproductive.
As you can see, just writing about these topics makes my blood boil.
And I know that being angry only makes everyone around me tense, angry, and upset.
I really don't want that for anyone.
So, why won't others treat me that way?
Maybe I am just too sensitive now.
But, there is always the bedroom, my haven of darkness, quiet, and solitude.
I go there often.
I have read on the LBDA website that others  with LBD have this issue also.
I am not alone.
I only wish the people around me would do the research also.
Then they would understand my issues and all of our lives would be smoother.
Maybe I am just making water in the wind.

One of my mentors in the Navy passed away last December and their are just planning his funeral for next weekend.
There were some legal issues and the parties involved have finally decided to bury the Master Chief.
I have been in contact with his Niece and have been invited to the funeral.
But, as much as I would like to be there, I just can't make myself leave my friendly confines and travel.
There was a Ship's Reunion for the USS Caron.
A ship and crew that holds a very special place in my heart.
I did not go, even though we planned to go.
Why, because I just could not bring myself to travel 1200 miles and stay in a place I have no connection to.
Yes, we went back to Virginia Beach in September.
But that was home and I was glad to be there.
I knew my way around, had friends to be with, and visit.
I was in my home Church and always surrounded with familiar locations and people.
So, I was pretty good with that trip.
But truthfully, I wonder if I will ever go anywhere overnight again!
I really cannot describe the feelings that stop me from traveling.
In the planning stages of the USS Caron reunion, I was somewhat excited.
But as we fleshed out the plans of the travel, I became completely overwhelmed!!
Planning the trip became a total block to me going.
I feel safe in my home and the ares around it.
Hotels are OK, for a night, if I can have Marcel the wonder dog with me.
But I don not feel safe or comfortable in crowds of people I do not know.
I do not like mass travel venues like airports.
And I want to be in familiar surroundings all the time.
Then there is the cost.
I do not participate in the day to day finances of the household.
But, from what I hear, I need to be careful as to how we spend money.
That being said, she we are planning a trip, I become frightened of spending money.
I guess, all in all, I am afraid to travel much past the bridge that leads to Pensacola!
Will I travel again, I don't know.
There is little I want to do or see.
I loved being back in Virginia Beach since I miss my friends, the Church, and the area so much.
And my wife has a family reunion in Iowa next July that is very important to her.
So, those may be the only two trips we make.
Maybe it is the planning that bothers me.
If we just got up and went,  I might be better.
I am not sure and it confuses me to ponder this topic too much.
But, as this blog is about the journey, I thought I had better address this topic while I remembered.
More later.

I had a telephone call with my sister today.
She lives in the Cleveland area still and we do not get together as much as we would like.
She asked me about how I was doing and I am very open to tell her.
I told he about my hallucinations and she got very quiet.
I joked about the and than she relaxed.
She said I had a good attitude about what was going on.
My reply was;  "I can be grumpy and a pain for everyone to be around or I can find something funny about what's happening!"
It's true, the Psychiatrist said the same thing to me the last time I saw him.
I choose not to be negatively impacted by LBD.
Seeing things that are not there IS a shock.
But as long as they are not attacking me, I can laugh at them.
But I was shocked at how she handled my symptoms.
Loved ones seem to internalize my issues and not really face them head on.
Since my Sister is a far distance away, she probably has built these symptoms up in her mind.
I probably would do the same thing if it were her that was effected.
But no one can really understand what I am experiencing.
For instance, today, I saw a piece of paper sticking out of my cell phone  which was on the table next to my chair.
I pushed at the paper and it disappeared into my cell phone.
So, I picked up my cell phone and opened to up to remove the paper.
There was no paper there!
It never was there.
So, how does someone deal with that as the observer?
I am sure it is frightening to them.
But I choose to enjoy this journeys much as I can.
Another thing I have recently discover that I lost was my "Third Party" view of LBD.
In the beginning, I could look at what was happening to me as if I was disconnected from the symptoms.
I had the feeling like I was watching this happen to someone, but not me.
Not, I know it is me!
Another new issue is that my short term memory is even worse.
Writing this post is difficult because I cannot remember what I wanted to write next!
So, I have to sit and rerun my thoughts back, read what I typed, and try to remember the next though I was going to express.
These posts do not come as smoothly as they used to.
At least I can still express myself, even if it is more difficult.
Like most diseases, LBD does not just effect the person that has the disease, it impacts everyone in the sufferers life.
I am aware of that and try to be as tough as I can and I try to defer as much worry on the part of those who love ma as I can.
I fear that soon, I will loose that ability also.

OK, I am not Earl Pitts!
But there are two things related to LBD that cause me to get angry.
First, even though Lewy Body Dementia is the second most common form of dementia, there are very few local support groups.
You may be thinking, why don't YOU start one.
I am the one who needs it!!
I am no longer capable of taking on that level of detailed organization.
Not to mention tax exempt status and all the legal issues.
I retired from my job because I could no longer do that sort of thing.
Second;  When a Senior Citizen is getting ready to move into a Continuing Care Retirement Facility, there are very few individuals of businesses that can help you down size, check out facilities, provide financial counseling, or even give you the latest inspection reports from the facilities you are looking at.
No, instead, we are operating in the dark!!
Trust, me, in this lost community of Pensacola, there are no helpers available.
I have done exhaustive research on the Internet and finding CCRC's is difficult.
Finding someone to provide you any information is impossible.
So, those of us who are LBD patients and our care givers are on their own as we search for facilities, check out financing, and try to sell valuable furnishings that will not fit in our new lifestyle.
Did we select a great community?
Is the entrance fee fair?
How did the Memory Care unit do on it's last inspection?
I know what the community we chose told us.
But, is that their view or an objective agencies view?
As my generation ages, services like this will be more and more in demand.
And we can't be the first people who want this type of help.
Yet, here we are, out in the dark, groping for a direction.
And you know how much I don't like the dark!

I know I have written about "Sun Downing" before, but tonight I may have a better understanding of this condition that so many of us deal with.
Every night when the sun goes down, I feel trapped, alone, abandoned, encased, angry, and vulnerable.
I sit in my chair with a light glaring on me.
My dog by my side, I seldom move.
If I do move, it is just to go to the bathroom, get more coffee, or go to bed.
Once in bed, I tuck myself in tightly, my dog lays close to my side, and I try to go to sleep as quickly as possible.
If I do not go to sleep quickly, I start to have angry thoughts about the days activities, or about life.
Sleep is better.
I did not realize all the emotions that I experienced until tonight when my wife asked me; "Are you angry?"
The answer is no and yes.
I am not angry at Her, but yes, I am angry.
Angry at the other emotions that trap me.
I can only imagine the frustration and pain someone feels that has this issue and cannot express themselves.
My Father in Law had Alzheimer's in the late 1980's.
He died from Alzheimer's in 1991.
He was a deaf as a stone.
He spoke with a thick German accent and because of his deafness had problems communicating with people.
He never expressed his emotions or his experience with Alzheimer's.
He did escape to sleep as I do and slept for over 24 hours a couple of times that I witnessed.
He suffered and died because he could not tell us what he was experiencing.
Of course, there were not medicines like Namenda or Arecept in those days.
He was silent, alone, and isolated.
I now, at this minute,  understand.
Sun Downing is difficult to endure but at least I can tell others about my experience.
One other frustration.
I know that every night, when the sun goes down, I will experience this prison.
Unlike other LBD issues,  Sun Downing does not come and go, it happens every single day.
My own terror that never misses it's appointment.
So that's it.
Personal reflection has lead me to begin to understand how Sun Downing effects me.
I hope this helps others.

<doc date=Monday, October 28, 2013>
Now before you get all excited, intercourse is a conversation between two people.
That's what I had today with my newest neurologist.
I like Dr. King, he listens and responds to our questions  and concerns.
Today, he wanted to prescribe a new drug to deal with the hallucinations.
We pushed back because I am tired of being a science experiment.
And, he could not say the new drug would have a better than even chance of accomplishing what it is I was taking it for!
So, no new drugs.
I also asked him about surgery under general Anestassia for my left shoulder rotator cuff.
The pain for in my shoulder is substantial and it wakes me up at night.
But, I don't want to wake up from my surgery in another time zone either!
Dr. King said he would get with the shoulder doctor and get a decision.
OK, I can deal with that answer.
Let's talk about the hallucinations.
I have been holding this information back until now.
But, now I am ready to divulge the changes in my condition.
My hallucinations have taken on a more realistic dimension.
Recently I have seen people, real people, in locations that are logical for real people to be.
These people looked real, but upon questioning my wife, they were not there.
This had happened about a year ago and I actually was going to pick a fight with the person, who my wife said was not there.
But these recent hallucinations have set me on edge.
I have reduced my driving and never go out without my wife or someone I trust.
This is a major development in my disease.
Dr. King asked me if I saw a Psychiatrist and I do.
The Psychiatrist I see specializes in dementia.
So he is an exceptional person to help me.
I see that doctor tomorrow, so more intercourse!
We will see where this appointment leads.
Others of you in the LBD family have dealt with this development and I am not all that surprised.
But I am very concerned.
This change will definitely change my life and my wife's.
I will keep you informed.  
</doc>
<doc date=Friday, October 25, 2013>
We have seen some down grade in my condition and I have noticed some signs of stress on my wife.
We have noticed me experiencing more realistic hallucinations, more confusion, more exhaustion and weakness.
She is with me 24/7/365 without a break so this should not be a surprise.
We had one of our long discussions today and her stress and anxiety.
She has not been sleeping well for the last month or so and is emotional with me.
We had a disagreement that ended in some very hurt feelings on both of our parts.
This is totally not normal for us.
Arguments have NEVER been a part of our 40+ year marriage.
We both agreed that this is a part of her stress and anxiety over the progression of my disease.
This is a new, unwelcome, development in our journey with LBD.
I have written about our decision to apply for residence in a continuing care retirement community.
The one we applied to has a waiting list and that causes some stress also.
Waiting is never easy, especially when you are working against an unknown deadline.
What deadline you may ask?
The deadline of me still being well enough to be judges able to live independently by the professionals at the CCRC.
Yes, I have to pass an inspection of my cognition.
Life is never easy and life with Lewy Body is an even greater challenge.
So, all of these challenges have combined to cause stress, anxiety, and anger in my wife.
I am pretty much impervious to these mental issues.
They slip my mind and I just don't think about them.
Convenient, I think.
Bad short term memory can be a blessing.
But my wife has perfect short and long term memory and she thinks about all of the possibilities, negative and positive, of our future, all the time.
No wonder she can't sleep.
She is a planner.
Financial, moves, even furniture placement in an apartment we have not moved into yet.
Just the same, her planning has kept us in great financial condition for over 40 years.
You cannot argue with success!
But, I wish the stress and anxiety would leave he so she could get some restorative rest.
I am sure other care takers suffer from the same issues.
But in our case, their appearance is relatively new or at least relatively newly expressed.
So, as with all the other issues of LBD, we will trust God and look to Him for guidance and rest.

<doc date=Monday, October 21, 2013>
One thing I can state is that who I am now is totally different than who I was before this disease.
my personality, demeanor, build, strength, stamina, even how I talk are all radically different.
I know it is a shock to my wife and son.
But there is a strange metamorphosis when I am around Navy friends and acquaintances.
Today, a friend who worked with my wife called us and said she and her husband were in town and would like to stop by.
Besides the fact that they woke us up at Oh Dark Thirty, we were glad to have the visit.
Her husband was career Navy and is enjoyable to talk too.
We have some things in common, but he was a Navy Counselor, and if you read my Navy Blog, you know my opinion of that rate.
Just the same, for two hours, I got to be who I was.
A gruff, opinionated, hard core Master Chief Gunner's Mate.
Then, they left to continue their trip and I was back in LBD mode.
I find that change interesting because I never really saw it until today.
Around Navy people, I can go back in my mind and be who I was.
I see myself as young, powerful, knowledgeable, determined, and in charge.
Once I am out of that influence, I realize I am none of those things anymore and I slide back into reality.
People who see me for a few hours always say I look good or that they cannot see any effects of the disease.
That is because, for that period of time, I feel like the clock has turned back 20 years.
I have read that this is called "Playing to the crowd" or being a "Spot light player".
Personally, I see it as being in a comfortable place in my mind.
When I am with Navy folks that actually share interests with me, I am mentally comfortable.
When I am not, I feel distant and disconnected.
The only other place I feel mentally in charge is when I am doing God's work as a Pastor or Bible Study leader.
Again, I am with people of like minds and I concentrate on that commonality.
I like cars so I can connect on that subject.
But few people are really interested in cars.
I like fire arms and because of my Navy background, I am a subject matter expert in that area, but again, it is not good dinner conversation.
I steer clear of politics because I get angry over the course of the Country.
And again, if you read my blog at all, you know I try very hard not to get angry.
Other than those four things, I am not interested in anything.
So being engaged with folks outside of those areas is a strain.
One other interest area.
I like football, and I watch most games on television.
But if you ask me what games I watched the next day, I can't remember the teams names!
I can remember outstanding plays but not the team that made them.
Again,  as I have commented before, I find that mental disconnect interesting.
I do not like who I am now.
I am somewhat of a stranger to myself so I must really be difficult for my wife and son to understand.
This truly is a cruel and perplexing disease.

I have said before that when the sun goes down, I have emotional and mental difficulties.
I have also commented on my view of how people close to me appear to treat me.
Now, I am questioning my own thoughts and comprehension of how people treat me.
Can I be the problem?
Am I reading an attitude that is not there?
You have probably heard the statement; Just because I am Paranoid does not mean they are not all out to get me!
Am I Paranoid?
I have told you about how I view the people here in East LA, the Panhandle of Florida, as clannish, unfriendly, and aloof.
Could it be my misreading them?
Even my wife, seems distant and gruff with me in the evenings.
That is certainly not her manner with me normally, but recently, that is what I observe.
Again, are my observations valid?
Could my mind be playing tricks on me?
In the past, I have accused family members of following me and spying on me.
No one has convinced me they were not!
Yet, this recent feeling of dislike I am feeling may be just my Sun Downing impacting my ability to understand people.
Days seem fairly normal, but the evenings are a totally different matter.
I feel disconnected from those around me.
I have commented to my wife that feel like I am somewhere else.
Not really here.
I know that is hard to understand.
But things seem different in my perception.
My days are jumbles of events that I try to replay in my mind before I go to sleep.
Many times that replay frustrates me.
Maybe I am reading too much into this issue.
Or maybe I am the issue!

Today, I went to play table tennis with a friend that has Parkinson's.
We manage to play once or twice a week.
In spite of his affliction he is a great table tennis player.
We play at a recreation center operated by the local Methodist Church.
Many folks from the neighborhood come there to workout, do aerobics, and just talk during the week.
On Sunday, it is a Church, meeting on the full court basketball facility that seats over a thousand for two services every Sunday!
While we were playing, an acquaintance I know who has Lewy Body Dementia like me, walked by.
I would much rather talk with him and his wife than get beat like a nail by a fellow with advanced stage Parkinson's playing table tennis.
Andy, his wife, Sam, my table tennis partner, and myself sat a talked for 30 minutes.
I cannot tell you how refreshing it is to compare symptoms and problems related to LBD with another person with LBD.
He and I are on the same sheet of music, even though he is a step or two further down the path than I am.
We can and did compared testing experiences, hallucinations, medicines, muscle pains, and other issues he and I share in common and some he has that I don't or that I have an he does not, yet.
For that 30 minutes, I forget that people call me a liar and say I am not sick.
I forget that I hurt every night, can't remember my last thought, don't know what meds I take, and sometimes forget how to read.
Instead, we are the same.
We are a community of two, dealing with life the best we can.
We do not have a disability we have a challenge.
If you do not have LBD you cannot understand the comfort I feel being with another LBD patient.
I believe sufferers of cancer, MS, or even Diabetes may have the same issue.
Being with someone, talking with someone, commiserating with someone, walking the same path as you is comforting.
For instance, I have written about REM sleep disorder and how I live out "Fight" dreams in my sleep.
And how I punched, no poleaxed, my wife one night.
And how I now take meds to help that issue.
Andy has not had that issue.
I am glad and I hope he never does!
But he was understanding and interested in my issue.
That is comforting and helpful.
My wife and I plan on having them over soon to make our bond stronger.
This was a good day.

I have heard personally, from more than one Dementia patient that they feel their wives, family, friends, do not respect any more or respect them less because of their diagnosis.
So I though I would try to dissect this  a little.
You will notice, I only refer to men.
I do not know any female Dementia patients.
So, I have no basis to address their issues.
Second, I am a man and as a man, trying to understand the Psyche of the female is pointless.
But, I fully understand being a man.
As a successful man, I was fully in charge of my life.
Yes, I acknowledge GOD is in control of my life and all of life.
But for this discussion, we will look at this as seen through a man's point of view.
I worked, all the time.
Made good money, saved, invested, bought and sold homes, made some good and bad decisions.
Took credit for the good and responsibility for the bad.
I was intelligent, resourceful, witty, and caring.
My wife looked to me for guidance, answers, knowledge, on many issues.
I fixed things around the home, the car, the lawn mower, the landscaping, the Church.
I was capable, physically fit, not overly emotional, and even dependable.
I was sexually capable, at least in my mind.
Concerned for the emotional and physical well being of my wife and son.
Did I have faults, yes!
But none so bad that I would get fired from any position in my life.
I did the best I could to provide and better the life style of my wife, my son, and those around me including in-laws and extended family.
I had good, close friends that counted on me and I counted on for help, advice, and support.
All in all, I consider myself to be an all around good guy.
Not perfect.
But not fatally flawed either.
Does this sound like the man you are married too?
I thought so.
Then why, when he is effected by a degenerative neurological disease, do you treat him like he is a juvenile delinquent that can't be trusted, can't do anything right, and does not listen to anything you say?!
I mean that!!
I talked to another Lewy Body Dementia patient at a local rec center I go to and he told me the same thing.
If anything goes wrong, it is his fault!
He fits the description I just laid out.
He is a retired Navy Captain!
Yet today, he is treated like an E-1 Seaman Recruit.
We don't screw up on purpose.
We don't sit and think, how can I piss her off today!
Instead, we think, how can I stay out of trouble today!
The Captain told me, he tries to be dressed and ready to go out the door 10 minutes before his wife says they have to leave.
He told me that as his wife was walking u to us and she said;  He is the reason we are always late!!
Why berate someone for trying to meet the standard you set?
I have a theory.
We are being disrespected because we are no longer what we were!
It is like we are now useless.
Like a car that won't start, or a cracked tea pot, or a broken chair.
Broke beyond repair and not worth a place in the home.
Well, if that is the way you fell, put us in some care facility and leave us there.
We cannot defend ourselves.
We cannot do better and I promise you we will do much worse.
If you can't love and respect us in the stage we are in, I promise you really won't be happy changing our Depends and treating our diaper rash!
None of us planned on getting Dementia.
I certainly did not go out and get infected with the Dementia bug on purpose.
But, I have it.
I can't change it, and I am tired of apologizing for it.
When you went through menopause, did we treat you with disrespect.
I did not and I believe your husbands did not either.
Why do I say that with confidence?
Because you are still married!
Most men who can't deal with menopause get a divorce.
If your are still married, he cares!
So, why not try to understand his issues now that he has Dementia?
I know this sounds emotional, and it is.
But those of us trapped in Dementia are emotionally compromised and angry words, harsh looks, and disapproving comments impact us more than ever before.
We try to meet the standards we lived up to our entire lives.
We can't!
It is physically and mentally impossible.
But we hurt inside because we can't.
We feel diminished.
Less of a man, and even lees of a lover.
It is difficult to tell you how bad we are hurt by our disease.
And then, the disapproval we incur for trying is even more cutting than you can imagine.
Maybe it is difficult to respect the man who could do everything and now does not have the energy, mental capacity, or physical strength or ability to do what he used to.
But remember, you don't wear size 8 dresses anymore either.
Neither is a reason to disrespect you spouse.

This blog has been a labor of love for me.
I started this endeavor at the encouragement of my Wife and my Neurologist.
It is a sort of therapy for me but I hope it is a source of first hand information on how Lewy Body Dementia impacts the person effected by LBD.
I have explained and discussed all but the most personal issues of how LBD has affected my life.
But the most rewarding part for me the may comments you, the readers, post.
Many of you have commented on the "First Person" approach I have used.
God has given me the ability to write about what I experience and feel in this journey.
Other well written blogs approach LBD from the "Care Giver's" point of view.
I read these blogs and have gained some very useful information and my Wife and I appreciate their candor and truthfulness.
It is very important for the care givers with experience to inform the new care givers of the issues they face.
For those of us with LBD, there is little chance to interact with a fellow LBD sufferer.
The LBD Association does a great job keeping us up to date on treatments, research, and symptoms.
But there is still a need to understand the silent issues the LBD sufferer faces.
Sun Downing, vivid dreams that meld into your waking hours, the urgent need to know where your care giver is, 24/7/365, and other annoying issues we have.
These are the areas I try to provide input for and I will as long as God gives me the ability to write.
That being said, it is more difficult to express myself.
As I have described before, my anger issues have increased and that makes it difficult to write an unemotional blog.
You probably agree with me on that.
But I will continue to try.
LBD can be a lonely journey for the person with the disease and the care giver.
Very few people even know what LBD is!
And then, when you tell them about it you get the reply;  "He doesn't look sick!".
Well, try being with him after the sun goes down.
Trying sleeping with him when he dreams of a fight and punches you in the nose!
So, we all need to educate those around us about this quiet, tortuous, disease.
I appreciate your readership and friendship.
I very much appreciate your comments and suggestions.
We are in this journey together.
When one of us grieves, all of us must grieve.
We are our own support group and I encourage even more of your to blog about your experiences with Lewy Body Dementia.
There is plenty of room for all of us!
Again, Thanks!

Winter is coming, even in Florida, and the days are getting shorter.
Darkness causes Sun Downing.
A symptom of dementia.
I suffer from this issue and have for quite a while.
But lately, it is becoming more pronounced and more of a problem for me and my wife.
As the sun goes down and the house gets darker, even with lamps on high, I get agitated, grouchy, and easily upset.
Comments made take on negative connotations i my mind and I get angry and combative.
Not physically, at least not yet.
But outbursts are common and my anger is noticeable.
This is new as I have written before, since the LBD has progressed I have tried earnestly to control my temper.
I know how angry I can get and I don't want that temperament to take over my life.
But, lately, as it gets dark, my mood does too.
I must always know where my wife is and anything she says can invoke a grumpy response from me.
If she goes into another room and I don't notice I yell for her.
I even get angry with Marcel the Wonder Dog.
I will go to bed early if I feel I am overwhelmed with the Sun Downing and that has become a habit lately.
Sometime escape to the sleep world is the better part of discretion.
I hope I can keep that level of self-control.
As far as I know, there is no help for this.
As my best friend Jerry says;  "It is what it is."
And ith that, I am going to bed.

<doc date=Tuesday, October 8, 2013>
I spend much of my awake and sleeping time thinking and reminiscing about the past.
And recently, those thoughts have turned towards the things that excited me.
I spent 40 years of my life in or working for the Navy.
In those early years, I was motivated to promote, accomplish qualifications, pass inspections, complete required training, deployments, transfers, choosing challenging duty assignments, and learning as much as I could about being a Sailor.
Then I retired from the Uniformed Service and joined the Civil Service working for the Department of the Navy.
Those years were filled with the same motivators.
Nothing changed.
I also married during my Navy time and I was dedicated to caring for my Wife, homes, moves, raising my son, Church programs like AWANA, and getting a college education.
Additionally, I was interested in competitive shooting, the NRA, The Friends of the NRA, and being a urban survivalist.
I also followed politics, football, NASCAR, and Baseball!
All of these things kept me going, kept my internal clock ticking, kept me interested in life.
But now, I cannot tell you what, if anything, motivates me, excites me, keeps my internal clock ticking.
Yes, I have the time to do things but no desire and no one to do them with.
Yes, I enjoy shooting, once I get there,  But I have no desire to expend the energy to plan an outing.
The things I spent so much time and money obtaining are now the things I am worried about safely storing and keeping from theft.
They have become a burden not a pleasure.
Actually, almost everything has become a burden and not a pleasure.
Even my belief that I could defend the home front from intruders and marauders is but a fantasy.
Everything I cared about and work so hard for are now a burden at best and a source of fear and frustration for me.
I hate to watch politics and get angry and depressed over the Socialist, Muslim centric direction our government is headed.
So, I try not to watch.
The bottom line is, I feel useless, worn out, disconnected, and isolated most of the time.
I try to rebound, act like I am feeling better, even act normal.
But I am not and I do not know how to fix this.
I am not attached to the world around me because I don't like it and I am mentally somewhere else.
Maybe the move to our CCRC will help.
It is a beautiful place and maybe I can make some new friends.
We will have some things in common, old age!
Even my health has taken something away from me.
I love to eat!
I love bread, pies, cake, fruits, lasagna, pasta, beer, pizza, and everything else.
But, since my body had issues processing all of those carbohydrates, and my blood sugar was high, I was directed by my GP to reduce my carbohydrate and sugar intake.
I have, it worked, at least on my weight.
Blood tests will show if my blood levels also agree with my weight loss later this year.
But, I can never eat like I did before.
Why, because all the good I have accomplished will go away!
This is not a new issue and I have written about it before.
But it is getting more pronounced.
Will these mental issues get better like my weigh and blood chemistry?
I doubt it.
I see the future and I don't like it.
This is the first time I have openly said that I am not happy with my condition.
Maybe that is good.
But the recent changes have let me know the future and my inability to get excited about anything only reinforces what I already know.
I have told you before, I don't want sympathy.
Understanding yes, but no sympathy.
So, that's where I am right now.
Maybe tomorrow will be different.
Only time will tell.

I recently received a comment from a reader discussing REM Sleep disorders and LBD.
The reader was absolutely correct.
I have REM sleep issues including acting out my very life like dreams.
I wrote about it before, but to keep it short, one night, I was dreaming I was in a big fight and I desperately needed to hit someone!
I did!!
And I drove my Wife across the bed!!
I take some drugs for that problem but I still move around a lot and my Wife stays on alert for any quick moves on my part.
REM sleep disorders are a prime indicator of LBD.
When we told my neurologist about the punching episode she said; "I was expecting that!"
I told her a "Heads Up" would have been nice.
But she told us she did not tell us because she wants everything to develop on it's own.
Just the same, I had a hard time getting my wife to stop sleeping with a catcher's mask on!
Vivid, life like, dreams has been an issues for me the last few years.
I dream in color, with the faces of present and past friends and family, and many deceased friends and family featured.
I also have many "fight" or combat dreams.
I also have issues with these vivid dreams becoming reality when I wake up.
I have had days when I tried to complete the task I was dreaming about.
Trust me, that is unnerving!
LBD is a disease that increases with time.
Little issues start to pile on top of other issues until you have so many symptoms you are overwhelmed.
Dreams, hallucinations, memory loss, loss of reading capability, forgetting the names of those around you, fear of new places, new people, crowds, being totally routine based, thinking people are stealing from you, following you, and did I mention hallucinations.
I am sure there are other issues, but I don't remember any others at this time.
Thanks for the comment on REM sleep disorders.
It is important to keep people up to date on the problems those with LBD experience.

<doc date=Sunday, October 6, 2013>
You may have noted in my last few posts a certain edge in my attitude.
It is not on purpose but it is a further progression of the LBD.
I have wrote before how I try very hard, to hold my anger in.
Others around me get angry, shout, scream, cuss, and loose their temper in general.
But, for the most part, I hold my anger and aggravation in.
I believe, loosing my temper, showing my anger, my frustration, especially about my condition and how life around me impacts me, would cause more issues than solve.
But lately, I am having difficulties holding in my rage and when I do, it bubbles and ferments in my mind until LBD erases the reason for my angst.
I know that others around me are frustrated over my condition.
And I DO appreciate their feelings.
But they are not the one unable to remember, drive, move, read, or do other things they once did.
This change has been coming slowly and my wife and I have both noticed these changes.
But how it has impacted my inner control capability is new and upsetting.
I have to live in a world of people who are not effected by LBD and have no understanding of the disease.
They think I have no issues  and that I am a gold brick at best!
Yes, there are people that have told me that.
I won't say what I would like to tell them!
Self-control!
But my ability to live in this "normal" world is diminishing and soon I will start to blurt out my emotions and feelings without filter or consideration for feelings or setting.
That should be interesting.
As I use this venue as an education for those of you without LBD, I also use it as therapy.
This time, it is more of a warning of things to come.
Things I no longer have control of.
Things I would rather not have to deal with.
Things, just things!

OK, I have spent a number of posts explaining the process of trying to determine where we should like.
We went to the Continuing Care Retirement Facility last Friday to show our Son and Daughter in Law.
It was a good visit and they both thought this was a great facility that fit us perfectly.
So do we!
So tomorrow we will submit our deposit.
This action will place us on the Priority Waiting List.
You may ask, how long is the waiting list?
That is a hard question to answer.
There are people who have been on the waiting list for over 6 years!
But, they want a specific unit, facing a specific way, in a specific building!!
We are very open to the unit we get because there are at-least four floor plans that fit us very well.
So, we may only wait a few months.
Time will tell.
I believe this is the best place to live for us.
I freely admit that it is not the best choice for everyone.
But it answers many questions about our future that have bothered me ever since I was diagnosed with LBD.
Like, what happens when I need professional care?
What happens if my wife needs professional care because of a broken hip, or some other medical issue?
What happens if we both develop memory issues?
Yes, I have mine diagnosed now, but she has a strong genetic tie to Alzheimer's.
Not to mention stroke and cancer.
So, I believe this continuing care community meet all of our needs.
There is also the point is that most Continuing Care Retirement Communities will not accept me because I have an LBD diagnosis!
I have been totally up front with this facility and they say they will accept me in their continuing care plan.
That means, our cost does not rise regardless of what care needs we have, and regardless of time in professional care.
And that guarantee applies to both of us!
This fact alone makes this the best choice.
Not to mention the facilities!!
And everything is open 24/7/365!!
The indoor pool, the jacuzzi, the work out rooms, the lounges, the library, the recreation rooms, even the pool table!!
This is the right place at the right time!!!
And if you are a regular reader, I a on the list to the Armed Forces Retirement Home.
I would really love to live there.
It is a Continuing Care Retirement Community, but it only admits retired Enlisted personnel!
That means my wife would be on her own!
I have been married to my wife for almost 41 years and I like being with her!
So, the Navy Home really is not a perfect fit.
This place is.
So, tomorrow we take our first step.
It is a big step, but one I am ready to take.
I will keep you posted.

<doc date=Thursday, September 26, 2013>
I have written a number of times about doctors that have not been as caring or attentive as I would like.
This time I want ti write about a doctor that really shows the best in medicine.
Our GP left practice here in Florida so I was again forced to find a new GP.
The hospital chain, Sacred Heart help us connect to an exceptional doctor.
During our first visit, she spent an hour learning about where I was in my LBD journey.
After some blood tests, she told me my sugar and triglycerides were way too high.
I thought that meant I was becoming diabetic.
She said, no, you are eating too many carbohydrates.
She told me to lower my carbs and we both did.
I was eating 600-700 carbs a day!!
Now, I eat around 100.
The weight has just fallen off of me!
To date, in six weeks, I have lost 30 pounds.
I feel better, my blood pressure is down, and I am fitting into clothes that were in the "give away" bag!
In my last visit, I complained about an increasing pain in my left shoulder.
I had my right shoulder rebuild 15 or 20 years ago.
But, my left shoulder has has increasing problems over the last year or so.
My new GP, sent me to a shoulder doctor that was just as caring as her.
He told me he had done research on LBD in preparation for my visit!
Wow!!
Now, I have had the MRI and we will see the verdict this Monday.
Whatever it is, I trust this Doctor to have my best interest at heart.
I know I have complained about doctors not caring and not doing their homework.
But I have had two recent experiences with superior Doctors that emulate the best characteristics of the medical profession!!
The moral of the story is, don't give up the search!
!

<doc date=Wednesday, September 25, 2013>
That is a very important question.
What IS more important to you?
How you live today, Comfort, security,  and quality of life.
Or, future care.
That is really the basis for the struggle we are involved in right now!
Do we select a place to live that makes our living easy, comfortable, secure, even luxurious, today, with no promise or provisions for future care.
Or do we select a far more expensive Continuing Care Retirement Community (CCRC) that contractually guarantees assisted living and skilled nursing care at no additional cost?
Trust me, this is a difficult question to answer.
The entrance fee and monthly fees are certainly high or even exorbitant for most CCRC.
Or do we choose an over age 62 apartment community that provides a secure, luxurious, age specific place to live with no buy in fee and rents at about 33% of the CCRC?
Now, to be fair, this option places us at the mercy of other facilities if and when one of us needed professional care.
What we really need is a crystal ball.
Certainly a person with a confirmed diagnosis of LBD should be looking at future needs.
But paying for an undetermined period of time for care that may or may not be needed is something that should not be done without research.
Of course, most CCRC's that are not fee for service will not accept anyone with a confirmed diagnosis of dementia.
We are a bad investment!
Maybe that fact alone should sway my decision.
And in fact, it does have a heavy weigh on the side of the CCRC.
Another thing to consider is maintenance work on your present home.
I have had my expensive and emotional stories about this home and the home we sold in Virginia.
I see home ownership the same as boat ownership!
A hole that you pour money into!
I would much rather live in a facility, apartment or CCRC, that fixes anything that breaks and does things like install ceiling fans, grab bars, and comfort height toilets for free or a minimal fee.
Not to mention well maintained landscaping, club house, pool, and exercise facility.
So, while we are leaning towards the CCRC, small doubts still surface and cause trepidations.
Yet, in my case, a CCRC that will provide our family the security now and a contractual future care guarantee is the best choice.

<doc date=Monday, September 23, 2013>
I am still amazingly connected to life most of the time.
Yes, I have my moments and evenings are not my friend.
But, I still can logically approach issues and make my preferences known.
I do have problems making decisions!
That is part of the "Executive Function" of my mind being "broke".
Just like the part of my brain that keeps me from acting out my dreams.
Just ask my wife!
So, making decisions about how and where we will live in the near future is beyond me.
We have been discussing our options for three days.
Stay in our home, move to a continuing care facility, seniors apartments, the Navy Home for me.
Unlike families that have to make a quick decision to place a family member in an Assisted Living Facility or a Skilled Nursing Facility, we have the luxury of time, for a short, unknown period.
That may make this decision harder instead of easier!
We do not want to be a burden to our Son and Daughter in Law.
We need to consider the future health issues of both of us.
So that really rules out the Navy Home.
Now, if I get a call telling me I have a room there tomorrow, it might impact our decision.
But, that call is probably a year off.
We also need to preserve our savings.
Another issue is quality of life!
The upkeep of a home is a never ending job.
Now we have a beautiful new home but termites, leaking showers, landscaping, lawn equipment, and painting, all make me wonder why we bought another home in the first place.
Yes, it was cheaper at the time, but the overall expense is greater than the savings.
Not to mention the frustrations as I have written before.
So, while we have not made a decision yet, the driving factors are quality of life, provisions for most medical eventualities for both of us, and future security.
Then there are issues like using my God given spiritual gifts.
friends and family.
Trust me, this is not easy!
But it is easier for our Son and Daughter in Law because we are not in an emergency situation and we are involved in making the decision.
But, this is the first Continuing Care Retirement Community that openly said they would take me without reservations or conditions!
We told them about my diagnosis up front!
And we reminded the sales associate when we met with him.
Yet, they seem to want me.
Groucho Marx said: "I would never belong to a club that would have me as a member!"
I hope that does not apply here.
I helped place my Father in Law in a Skilled Nursing Facility when he was shipped to us with Alzheimer's Disease back in the late 1980s.
There were no memory support facilities and Nursing Homes had no idea how to deal with this disease.
Much has changed.
But being a family member of a Dementia patient and trying to find the best facility on a limited budget is a terror we do not want our Son to face.
I am truly sorry for those who have to endure this trial.
So, that's where we are right now.
Still in shock over the up front costs and the monthly fees.
Still trying to decide if the benefits are greater than the costs.
And still asking questions.
Decisions will come, and I will let you know when I know.

I have written earlier this week about home maintenance issues.
The post I wrote was emotional and truthful!
I am impacted by home maintenance problems before and we moved into a Seniors Apartment in Virginia.
Then we moved to Florida and there were no Seniors Apartments in the are we live.
We bought a home because it was less expensive monthly, than an apartment and it was not populated with college kids!
But, after two years, we may be ready for another option.
We have visited a number of fee for service communities and continuing care communities in Virginia and here in the Gulf Coast.
Today we visited a continuing care community that actually makes some sense.
As with ALL continuing care facilities, there is an up front fee, a monthly fee that pays for the apartment, most utilities, one meal daily for both of us, and other services like 24/7 emergency medical care.
Continuing care communities require you to be fully functioning when you move in.
Then, if you need assisted living, nursing care, or memory support care, it is provided at no additional cost.
In my case that is a very attractive option.
The facility we toured today was modern, elegant, and required a more reasonable up front fee than some others we have toured.
The facility was clean and pleasant.
The assisted living portion and the skilled nursing areas were clean and did not have the odor of urine which is prevalent in nursing homes.
The Independent Living apartments were available in any configuration you could want.
Some were quite grand!
But so was the up front fee and monthly fee!
We did tour a one bedroom with a den that was perfect for us.
It had 1050 square feet!
We also toured a two bedroom two bath that was very livable!
This community had every imaginable amenity.
Indoor pool, workout room, craft rooms, library that a small city would love to have, and a beautiful dining room.
Dining room service was restaurant style with a varied menu.
We enjoyed our lunch and ordered right off the daily menu.
The costs are shocking but the up front fee buys future care.
That is the best way look at an out lay of six figures for something you are renting!
But, try paying $200 a day for skilled nursing care.
That's $73,000 a year!
Two years of skilled nursing care equals the up front fee!
The other benefit is, my wife can live with me.
In the Navy Home, I am the only resident and she has to live somewhere else.
She can visit and stay for 5 days but she has to leave for 2 days.
And, if their is a hurricane, she has to leave.
Not a good scenario for her or me.
As this disease progresses, I will become more and more disoriented.
Right now, I have to know where she is at all times.
If she in not in the room I am in, I call out for her!
It is just where I am and it will only get worse.
We have also discussed this very openly with our son.
He is somewhat uncomfortable with this topic but he is also concerned about our future care.
Like any good son, he would like to have us live with him.
But, that stress is very difficult for a family and what if he has a great career opportunity that requires a move?
If I am in a facility, moving me would not be a good option.
I already don't travel well!
And that WILL get worse.
I am coming to the realization that moving back to Virginia is not going to happen.
Things cost more there and our Son and his family is not there.
It is a decision that hurts but I must defer to reason in this case.
I will always consider Hampton Roads home.
Since this facility has a waiting list, we need to make a decision soon.
It is not an easy decision and these next few days will be stressful.
But, it is ground we need to cover.
I will keep you posted.

I wrote a few hours ago about being overwhelmed over a leak caused by the recent shower remodel.
I know most people would not be bothered in the least about a problem that already had a solution.
After all, their work is warranted, in writing!
But, it still sent me into depression and fight or flight.
Now, after mowing the lawn to calm down, I feel better.
And yes, Bath Fitters already fixed the problem.
But, I am still effected by the event.
Little things seem to take over my life!
I get angry, depressed, anxious, overwhelmed, sad, and introverted when something goes wrong.
My wife is beginning to understand how much these things impact me.
I realize it is hard for someone not effected by LBD to understand why I get so effected by little things.
I am still coherent enough to express my feelings but not coherent enough describe how thing impact me!
My wife will ask me; "What's wrong?"
And I will reply, nothing, or I'm OK, or better yet, "I can't describe it to you."
This frustrates her and rightly so.
But, I really can't find the words to express myself or, I really don't remember what started my downward spiral.
Recently, I have been able to take some time to reconstruct the events that lead me to my melt down or depressive episode.
But, I am not always able to do that either.
I do know that I really would like to reduce the potential stressors in my life.
But that idea causes my vibrant wife problems because she does not want to live in a controlled atmosphere.
She is still fully functioning and not bothered by the little things in life.
I do not know the outcome of this dilemma.
Time will tell.
For now, all I can do is express my problems in the best way possible and be as understanding as I can about the impact of my condition on my wife and family.

I wrote before about what we thought was a stroke suffered by our miniature poodle.
We took him to our Vet and of course, Marcel the Wonder Dog was just fine.
Just the same, the Vet did some tests and discovered that Marcel may have low thyroid disease.
Today, the Vet did a follow up test and it verified that Marcel is indeed suffering from low thyroid disease, just like me.
So, thyroid disease is genetic!
I have it and so does Marcel.
The Vet told us he will be taking the same drug I do for his hypo-thyroidism.
Same dosage too!
Again, proving the family connection!
OK, I know there is no genetic connection between Marcel the Wonder Dog and I, but am emotionally connected to him and his health impacts me.
It is interesting how connected we are to our pets.
Marcel knows my moods, when I am feeling bad, and when I am happy.
He stays by my side all day and follows me around the house like a puppy!
I log him and want him around for a long time.
So, Marcel will be like me, better living through chemicals!

The last month or so, my left shoulder has real caused me problems.
Pain that keep me awake or wakes me up and pain causing limits in motion.
My GP, who I really like, sent me to an Ortho Doctor.
I did not know him, since I know very few folks here, so I was apprehensive.
The visit was a pleasant surprise!
First, the staff was friendly, efficient, and caring.
But the Doctor was a breath of fresh air.
He came into the room, introduced himself, asked my if I preferred Donald or Don, and then told me he had been reading up on Lewy Body Dementia and had some questions about how this disease was effecting me.
He asked factual, thoughtful, in depth questions!!
Wow!!
A Doctor who does his homework!!
Let's applaud.
I was really happy to be treated so professionally and with so much actual care.
After he examined me, we discussed our nest step and the possible steps after that.
He talked to me like I was actually intelligent and there!
Some Doctors, once they see my medicine list, discount anything I say or just don't talk "To" me.
This doctor even discussed the effects of General Anesthesia on LBD patients and said he would consult with my Neurologist before any surgery was scheduled!
So, while I complain about Doctors, I always want to let everyone know when I run into a physician that goes above and beyond the call of duty, and this one did.

We have lived in Florida for two years and we have had many of the normal Florida problems.
Termite swarms, termite infestations, heat, rain, love bugs, palmetto bugs, and did I mention termites.
We bought a new construction home and we have had termite problems from the start.
Our builder installed a ceramic tile shower to meet my grab bar requirements.
It looked very good, but it leaked through the grout.
I sealed the grout as instructed, twice!
It still leaked, I thought.
So, we decided to replace the shower using "Bath Fitters".
As they tore the old shower out, we found out what we thought was water damage was termite damage.
I called our exterminator and Steve showed up in less than an hour.
It turned out that the damage was from the last termite infestation and there was no living termites.
We did treat that area by drilling holes and spraying termite killer in the area.
But, they ate some wood just the same.
Our exterminator sprayed more "Product" in the area and in the drain trap holes.
If a termite lives through that, I will give it the house!
So, I can once again try to calm down.
My exterminator also told me scorpions were moving into our area.
Great!
More aggressive insects.
This day has been very stressful for me.
It seems the house continues to cause me stress and worry.
Yes, I have the best termite coverage available in Florida.
But, every time I turn around those wood eating bugs are attacking my home.
Houses are work that never ends.
Stress is not my friend and it makes me difficult to live with!
Even Marcel the Wonder Dog got yelled at!
I am overwhelmed at the moment and I cannot deal with my emotions.
It will be an early night in bed for me.

Today, we went to explore Fort Barrancas at Naval Air Station Pensacola.
We both wanted an outing and it was predicted to be below 90 degrees.
However, the humidity was very high.
Just the same, besides shopping at the Commissary last Thursday, it was our first outing since our trip.
Floridians get "Cabin Fever" in the summer, not the winter and we were suffering from cabin fever.
SO, out we went.
Fort Barrancas is big, on the side of a hill, and filled with steps, corridors and tunnels.
It is wonderfully preserved, seeing as it was constructed in the 1800, and a jewel of American History.
Our tour was enjoyable but it became painfully clear that our legs were not accustomed to this type of walking.
My wife commented on how much easier it was to walk in the Hampton Roads area.
I agreed!
But, we went on.
Both of us had to sit down on the benches a number of times!
My wife would call the breaks before I did, but that is just because I am just a bit tougher, or maybe more stubborn that she is.
Just the same, the humidity took it's toll.
I have commented on my mobility difficulties before and I did have my cane with me.
It helped!
But, now my legs are really letting me know they are unhappy.
This is symptomatic of LBD and I know that.
My wife has recovered from the exertion, just like she should.
Physical exertion does cause fatigue especially in hot and humid conditions.
But, unaffected with LBD, I would have rebounded quickly like I had so many times in the past.
Believe me, Subic Bay, the Western Pacific, Panama, Central America, are all hot, extremely humid, and breathing there is like breathing underwater!
But, I always rebounded quickly with minutes of rest and some water.
Not now.
We wanted to climb the Pensacola Lighthouse today, but that will have to wait until winter!
That's when the Florida natives come out of hibernation.
My legs will probably still give me grief, but I will sweat less and the breathing will be easier.
AT least, that's my theory!

A few minutes ago, I was sitting in my chair and Marcel, the Wonder Dog, wanted in.
I got up from my chair, navigated around one obstacle and promptly rammed my thigh into the sharp corner of our Secretary Desk in the living room.
The bruise will be horrific.
The pain is subsiding now, but it was a good one!
This is a lesson for all of us.
My stability is like my dementia, on one day and off the next!
We just came back from a visit to Virginia and I did not use my cane once.
Should I have, probably.
But I did not fall or run into anything of importance.
Yes, I rocked back a couple of times, but I had my Wife there to stabilize me.
Now, I am seeing more stability issues.
Do I have my cane in my hands, NO.
I am a tough, Navy Master Chief Gunner's Mate and canes are not part of the uniform, in uniform or in civilian clothes.
I know that is baloney.
But it is how I think.
But I do know canes serve two purposes.
One is to stabilize me.
The second is to let other know, that see me, that I have mobility issues.
A very good friend in Virginia called my cane a "Sympathy Stick" when I took it to a Gun Show.
He was right!
People showed me difference in crowds and let me close to the tables when they were three deep!
Sure that was cool, but I do not like the idea that I am handicapped.
Yes, I get angry when someone accuses me of malingering or not being sick.
So, I guess I am a contradiction.
But the real fact is, I should have my cane with me all the time.
In stores, I get tired easily and often look for a place to sit down.
And my Wife and I have learned that I am good for one outing a day.
After that, I am tired and many times grouchy.
But, the lesson learned here is to declutter the house, make wide paths, and keep my sympathy stick close to prevent pain and bruising caused by high speed collisions with furniture!
That is a lesson we all need to learn.
Hopefully you will learn it with out a painful contusion like I have on my thigh.
I think I will go apply some ice to control the swelling!

I wrote before about the emotional effect of our trip home.
It truly was wonderful!
I visited many of our long time friends.
Many of them are more like family that friends.
I even had the privilege and honor of preaching at our home church.
What a wonderful homecoming.
During our Communion service Sunday evening, one of the new members of our fellowship that I had the pleasure of meeting, asked me how I became a Pastor?
I had a long reply to his question, but I have been thinking about that question ever since.
As all of you know, I have LBD and I am somewhat slow in the evenings.
So, I probably did not answer that question as well as I could.
The trip highlighted to me a number of issues that effect me and others with LBD.
Certainly, Sun downing is a big issue.
Nights are not my friend.
Another issue is being out in the dark at all!
I really don't like being out after the sun goes down.
Many of you know I still drive, and I believe I still drive well.
I do get tired faster and easier and I noticed the fast paced traffic in the Hampton Roads area tired me out quickly!
When I visited the many friends that I worked with, I noticed that after 2 hours of talking, meeting and greeting old friends, and walking around our big facility, I was bushed!!
I was having problems talking coherently and even felt weak.
We spent that evening resting.
During the drive home, we spent 11 hours asleep in Savannah!
That was after an 8 hour drive.
We did share the driving fairly equally.
I was very glad that I did not try to drive anymore.
However, the next time we will fly.
Marcel the wonder dog will have to stay home.
One point here, I hate flying!!
But it will be better for me than driving this distance again.
My long distance driving is over.
Since we moved to the Panhandle of Florida two years ago, we have formed NO friendships.
It is not that we have not tried.
We have volunteered at Church, done Community events, and been open with our neighbors.
Yet, no friends.
I was beginning to think that there was something wrong with me!
Then, we went home.
Friends from all over wanted to see us.
We visited, hugged, laughed, worshiped together, ate together, and had fun.
More fun that we have had in 2 years!
That was the topic of yesterday's blog and the subject of much conversation in our home.
In closing, I enjoyed everything about our trip except returning to the Panhandle.
Yes, I love being with my son, daughter in law and grandsons.
But I am at a loss for friends.
I miss my friends and I miss my home Church.
</doc>
<doc date=Saturday, September 7, 2013>
We have been visiting the Virginia area where we lived and worked for 32 years.
Friends from the Navy and Church have filled our last few days.
It has been wonderful and we have not been able to see everyone.
Yet we have basked in the sweet aroma of friendship.
We have not been able to make any friends in Florida.
We do have our son and his family and I must say it is great being so close to them after their 10 years in upstate New York!
We are conflicted over this issue.
Then there is the issue of Continuing Care for both of us.
There is NO guarantee that I will be the one who needs assisted care.
My wife could just as easily be effected by a stroke or a heart attack.
We are scheduled to look at a continuing care facility in Pensacola the week after our return home.
This facility has told us they will accept me, with my diagnosis of LBD.
That is appealing since it would provide care for both of us regardless of our needs.
But, like any continuing care facility, they want major money up front!
We do get a break on that because we have long term care insurance.
But, the amount of that break will be discussed during our meeting.
We also found an over 62 apartment in Virginia that we both love.
That would put us back with all our friends and Church in Virginia.
But it would take us away from our son, daughter in law, and grandsons.
That would be terrible.
There is also the issue of me being fair to my wife.
She has moved many times on my whims, ideas, and wants.
She also moved a number of times because of the Navy.
Each move caused her to leave friends, comfortable surroundings and family.
I will not force my wants on her again!
Then there is the idea of another move.
I did not do well during the last move from Virginia to Florida.
I have no expectation that the reverse would be any easier on me or her.
I believe I am overwhelmed over this decision.
I also know I cannot make this decision alone.
I will seek counsel from God, my wife, and my family.
I truly do not know which direction to go at this time.

<doc date=Thursday, August 29, 2013>
My wife is very up to date on all the drugs I take.
She never gives me a new drug until she does her research as to side effects, interactions, and long term effects.
Then, she monitors each drug for side effects and communicates any issues with my doctors.
She even monitors the over the counter drugs like cold remedies and pain relief potions for interaction with my prescribed drugs.
I am in great hands!
Recently, my neurologist told me to reduce my Sinemet because it was, and always has, causing me nausea.
The neurologist tole me that Sinemet was a Parkinson's drug and would not help my parkisonian symptoms because I have LBD!
He is the FIRST neurologist to tell me that!
He also said his goal would be to take me off Sinemet.
Well, I cut down my dose for a week and then cut OUT my dose all together!
My leg and arm muscles feel the same and I do not have nausea!
I'm happy.
Prescription medications cause numerous issues and if they become more problems than the symptoms, it is time to get rid of them.
Razadyne and Namenda have helped me and we saw that from the beginning.
Yes, I know they will loose their effectiveness over time.
But right now, they help.
But it has been my experience that none of the Parkinson's drugs help me in any way.
I have taken a number of them with little or not positive impact and plenty of negative issues.
So, my point is, doctors are legal drug pushers.
Drug reps court them, give them free samples, give them studies on the drugs they sell, done by the companies they represent.
But I can't blame the doctors.
How can they be expected to research every new drug and new use drug out there.
So, they give us drugs and it is up to the patient and the care giver to tell the doctor the positive and negative issues of the effect on the patient.
What I am saying is, the patient and the caregiver have the power and responsibility of managing the drugs taken.
We should NEVER follow drug or treatment recommendations blindly!
So, I am Sinemet free, nausea free, and still stiff and sore.
That's progress!
</doc>
<doc date=Monday, August 26, 2013>
When things bother me, many times I get tired and introspective.
When my wife and caregiver asks me what is wrong, I say; "nothing, I'm fine, no problem."
As I have discussed before, my wife does not accept that and peels back the layers of cover up until she finds the root cause.
It is painful sometimes, but it works and we are much better for it.
Many times, I hide my hurt or disappointment on an issue and my disease causes me to forget the issue.
But the "Bruise" it caused remains.
Sometimes I look at that psychological bruise and wonder where and how I got it.
Sometimes, a number of those bruises accumulate until I have a sore spot that I cannot hide from her.
She then begins to probe until we find the source of all the bruising.
I realize I am much more emotionally sensitive now than before the progression of my LBD.
But I cannot expect my wife or anyone else to know what I am sensitive about or how what they say has effected me.
The burden to make my emotions clear in on me.
Unfortunately, I am defensive about telling those who I love that I am hurt over something they said.
It is truly a round robin.
So, we continue to work on openness and communications.
WE try to make these probing communication events non-hostile and without blame.
Furthermore, she understands that I sometimes forget where or how I got those bruises and she also understands that I am emotionally sensitive.
Just the same, I know I frustrate her and cause confusion.
But we love each other and are committed to making this journey as easy as possible.
WE have been and always be a team dedicated to each other.

<doc date=Monday, August 26, 2013>
I have found that it is easier for me to discuss my thoughts about my disease through this blog than in person, verbally.
Why, because I am alone and I am in charge of the flow of the conversation!
When I am discussing things in person, the person I am talking with is always in a hurry!
I see their frustration when I can't find a word, or my thoughts are slow.
That frustration makes it more difficult for me to formulate replies and interact socially.
So, I don't!
If I am in charge of the conversation, for instance, if I am telling a "Sea Story", I do pretty well because there are few questions to trip me up!
Some of you have commented on my ability to write about my experiences, when you question my voracity and tell my that I don't have LBD!
I exposes myself and my inner thoughts, to help other understand how this disease impacts the sufferer.
It is a bit unnerving to open one's self up explaining inner thoughts, fears, and disappointments.
I have addressed nearly ever part of the LBD experience in order to help my family and friends understand an to help the LBD community as a whole.
There is little information out there from the view of the patient.
And virtually no support groups.
So, those of us who have LBD and their caregivers, are on their own!
A lonely place to be.
This seems curious since LBD is the second most diagnosed type of dementia.
Oh well.
I find I am much quieter and much more reclusive because of this mental disconnect.
Like I have written in the past, people do not want to interact with me once they realize I have LBD.
I am annoying to them!
And they show it.
It seems they think I will infect them.
Just the same, through trial and error, I can get my thoughts out, fairly straight, through the use of this blog.
Another comfort in writing my thoughts is, while I control the flow, I can also edit them.
The lettering is all but warn off the "delete" key on my computer!
But, through trial and error permitted when writing, I can better get my thoughts across.
In a conversation, I loose the other participant after my second correction.
I understand that I can be annoying.
But I am not trying to be!
Honest!!
But because of LBD, my mind is just slower at processing things like replies!
Next time you are with me, observe my conversation skills and how I react when there are a few "normal" people having a conversation.
You will most likely find me uncharacteristically quiet.
That's because what I wanted to reply to went by me 5 minutes ago, and I know telling you now will only make me look stupid!
It's like having a new car with old car technical knowledge.
I know what is wrong, I just can't tell you!
I guess it is frustration for both of us.

Many people have said I was too young to have LBD.
I was in my late 50's when I was diagnosed and I will admit, because of the tenacious professionalism of my Neurologist in Virginia, I was diagnosed when my symptoms were still in their infancy.
This permitted early treatment which the Lewy Body Dementia Association now says is the BEST thing to do for Lewy Body Dementia!
But, think about it.
No one says I am too young to have totally grey hair!
No one says I am too young to have arthritis.
No one says someone is too young to take Viagra.
I say that based on the observed age of the people on the commercial.
The fact is, Lewy Body Dementia impacts people from 50 on.
Yes, it is found more often people late in life.
I wonder if that is because the patient has "Hid" the symptoms!
I will bet that is the case if we look at the facts of the past.
Many times, we hide problems until they are too "Big" to conceal.
Especially men!
Also, sometimes memory loss is incorrectly written off to normal aging.
Yes, older folks forget where they leave their keys.
But do they forget where they are?
Or how to read?
Probably not.
But if they do, a neurologist visit is in order.
But, just because we have LBD, we still want to live our lives to the fullest.
It is just a bit more challenging, in the beginning.
That challenge does increase.
However, with proper medication, it increases slowly, at least in the beginning.

Today, Marcel the wonder dog, my constant companion, scared us.
We were at our Son and Daughter in Law's home.
I was holding Marcel, sitting on the couch, and suddenly he puled his left paw up to his chest and held it there.
My wife noticed it and had me set him on the floor to see if he could walk.
He could not even support himself.
Instead he fell over.
My wife and I immediately deduced that he was having a stroke and we quickly drove to our vet.
My Daughter in Law had called the vet and let his staff know we were en route.
The were waiting for us and very responsive.
Another symptom Marcel was showing was shivering.
Again, possibly a stroke.
Of course, Marcel was feeling somewhat better when the Vet saw him.
But, he was still not himself.
The Vet discovered a slight heart murmur that has never been discovered before.
Marcel was also somewhat tender in his abdomen and the Vet thought he might be in some back pain.
Marcel has had arthritis pain in the back before.
But, the Vet also said id may he a stroke, seizures, or even a brain tumor starting.
None of which we wanted to hear.
The reality is, Marcel is ten years old, a pure bread miniature poodle, and not all that active.
So, he may have some serious medical issues.
I accept the fact that all of us have a God planned expiration date.
Of course, Humans, who accept Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior, have heaven to look forward too.
But, since animals do not have a soul, they just expire.
Sad, I know.
My goal for Marcel is that he does not suffer.
That is how we will approach these next few days.
As for me, I am doing as good as I can.
He is my constant companion and friend.
He cheers me up when I am down and cuddles close to me when I am feeling bad.
He knows when I feel bad, aso I will stay close to him because he feels bad.
We will go through this together.
I often have thought whether he or I would pass on first.
I believe I now know.
How ever this ends, it is God's plan and I fully accept it.
I will keep you posted.

If you read very many of my posts, you know that I have been dealing with my own emotions as LBD impacts me and my family.
I have had to suffer the prejudice of people when they learn of my diagnosis and then tell me I am not ill, I don't look, act, sound, appear, ill, or that they don't think I have LBD because I am not progressing fast enough.
I replied recently on this blog to a reader who flame sprayed me for that very reason.
I was kind in my reply but the more I read that comment, the angrier I get!
Now, some of that can be attributed to my condition and sun downing.
But, I am also aggravated over the audacity of a person saying that I am a fake!
My Mom taught me, if I did not have anything good to say, don't say anything!
I have violated that admonition many times.
But tonight, I am going to follow it.
Just the same, anger is an issue those of us with LBD suffer from.
I try desperately to control it, especially with my wife and family.
Burning bridges where it concerns your primary care giver may come back to bite you when you are in a condition that you cannot defend yourself.
So, I try very hard with everyone to be nice, regardless of the situation.
So, while my tongue has teeth marks, I will follow Mom's admonition.
And I do appreciate your comments.
Some more than others.
And if you are angry with me because you think I am a fake.
Ask my wife, my neurologist, my psychiatrist, the CVS pharmacist, my son, my best friend, if I am faking it!
Additionally, I feel sorry for anyone who is angry that a fellow human being isn't suffering as much as they think he should!
Maybe you need some help.

Last night, my wife and I had a long, much needed, conversation about how and where I am in my journey.
It was a long time coming because I am less than forthcoming concerning how I feel.
She asked me why I did not talk about what is going on and I replied; "Because you are not interested."
She then asked me how I came to that opinion.
I replied that when she replies to my descriptions of what is going on with; " I have those issues too", it says "I don't care about your problems."
In my mind, it diminishes my problems and says they are not important.
So, I don't say anything.
Now, I know my wife cares, but discussing my problems causes issues because of of the replies I described.
I also get frustrated when people say; "You don't look sick".
Would you rather I was drooling on my shirt and wetting my pants?
I can do that is it would convince you that I am truly effected by this disease.
I also wonder where they got their medical degree!
Then there is the crowd that avoids me after they learn of my disease.
Trust me, it's not contagious!
It won't rub off on you.
So, my choice is to not tell folks that I have LBD.
Then, when I tire out after a short time they can think I am lazy or not a "Hacker".
I really don't care!
I am beginning to get aggravated with how people treat me and look at me.
So, I stay at home more.
Back to our discussion last night.
My wife and pull the facts about why I am aggravated out of me.
I'm sure it is like pulling teeth!
But not because I don't want her to know, but rather that I really don't know.
Things build up, but I forget what they were.
I remember I am aggravated, but I really don't know why.
SO she starts playing 50 Questions until she builds a picture of the time back to when I was not aggravated!
She is a good detective!
I am sure this is normal for dementia patients, but it frustrates her to no end!
But she has no choice if she wants to understand where I am.
Good old LBD continues to frustrate us.

You may think this has little to do with LBD until you realize how angry I get at night!!
I am sitting in my new lift chair, with a cup of coffee, my faithful Poodle friend by my side, trying to watch Pre-Season Football.
But the local station keeps interrupting the game to tell me about some groupie gathering of South East Conference college football morons!
First of all, college is was originally designed for the upper class, rich people.
to send their children to finish their education.
It was meant to broaden their spectrum.
In World War Two, the politicians wanted to pay back those who served so they came up with the GI Bill.
That made a way for any young person to go to college and turned the universities into trade schools!
Don't agree, watch those TV commercials.
College sports were little more that inter mural sports that cost nothing.
Today, they are billion dollar industries paying caches million dollar salaries.
College football is little more than the NFL minor league.
In any case, I am against ALL college sports!
You go to college to learn.
College football players do not go to classes, and when they do, they take fluff courses, that some smart nerd writes the papers for!
Most NFL players cannot read or write!
The idea that they are in college is a fantasy!
Maybe that is why Fantasy Football is such a big thing!
Then there are the so called fans of a college team that NEVER went to that college or any other college.
In the SEC, those fans are missing every other tooth, weight 300 pounds, and are very much like NFL players in that they can neither read or write!
Why would THEY be college football fans.
They haven't graduated from High School, or probably the sixth grade, which was the hardest 5 years of their education!!
If the NFL wants a minor league, they should start one like Major League Baseball did!
The NFL should pay the bill for this and not the tax payers of a state!
And by the way, very few college baseball players make it into the Majors in baseball.
They are too old by the time they graduate and they do graduate, unlike football players.
So, colleges and universities should be required to STOP all sports!
Stop ALL Scholarships for sports, and make college an academic endeavor!
It would reduce the cost of higher education and stop watering down the esteem of a college education.
Dumb jocks that can neither read or write can compete in the minor leagues of sports!
There, I don't sound too upset, do I.
It is night time!
ANd, if I offended you because you are a college football fan...GOOD!, I'm glad.
There, I feel better.
I'm going to bed.

I received a reply today from one of my readers.
I truly appreciate everyone who reads my blog and I hope I provide some valuable information.
I also cherish the comments that each of you send in.
I publish all of them with the exception of anything personal, profane, or obviously commercial.
The post I am responding to is from a person that has a parent recently diagnosed with LBD.
This is always a difficult time.
The individual asked me some questions that I want to answer here.
First, I am in my mid sixties.
I was diagnosed in 2009 after an exhaustive series of cognitive skills testing at my Norfolk Virginia neurologists office and then at the University of Virginia Medical Center.
After both groups of doctors agreed on the diagnosis of LBD, my neurologist immediately started me on Razadyne (Arecept family) and Namenda.
On the Lewy Body Dementia Association's website, I have learned that the earlier a LBD patient is placed on these two drugs the better the results are.
These two drugs seem to delay the degeneration better in LBD patients than in Alzheimer's patients.
Why, I don't know.
But it has worked well.
Also, I retired from a very high stress career early and that has helped me also.
Stress is a big negative to all dementia's.
I do hallucinate.
It started with small things.
A mouse running across the floor, birds in teh house, etc.
Now I see airplanes crashing, and horses in my backyard!
Really!
I have also seen cars where there were none, and boats that were not there.
Up until recently, I always knew these were hallucinations.
But lately, I have to check because they look so real.
Also, dreams are very real to me and I wake up trying to complete a task I dreamed about.
Another symptom I have is violently acting out my dreams!
One night, a while ago, I was having a dream and in that dream, I was in a fight, and I needed to punch someone, so I did!
It ended up I punched my wife, hard!
I now take meds to mitigate this.
My neurologist said the part of my brain that keep me from moving and acting out my dreams, is broke.
This is a normal issue in LBD.
Additionally, there is an entire family of drugs that people with LBD react badly too.
That family included Donepezel, Seroquel, Abilify, and these drugs caused me extreme anger issues.
That is a big indicator for LBD.
I don't take any of these now.
Another fact in my journey with LBD is that I was exposed, heavily, to a chemical that is proven to be neuro-toxic and a cancer causer.
That chemical was used in the hydraulic fluid used in the gun mounts I worked on for well over 20 years in the Navy.
We were never told of the danger until 1989.
We were covered in this oil, many times for weeks at a time because there was no fresh water for bathing.
It got in cuts, we swallowed it and breathed it when it was atomized by the 1500 psi hydraulic system.
I was hyper exposed to this toxic chemical through no fault of my own.
So, while I may be young for a LBD diagnosis, It is not out of the question.
I have met another retired Navy member who is my age and diagnosed with LBD.
He is a little further down the line than me.
WEBMD has a good site on LBD.
It says the normal run is 4-20 years for LBD so I am just in the first quarter if I believe their information.
I do know that because my neurologist in Virginia was so tenacious in my treatment, and diagnosed my condition so early, which lead to my use of Razadyne and Namenda early, I will probably have a longer period of cognitive capability that someone diagnosed late in the diseases progress.
Which is why I am doing as well as I can.
I do suffer from sundowners and I do take a nap almost everyday.
I have no stress in my life thanks to my wife.
She also administers all my medicines and runs our household finances.
I walk with a cane and sometimes a walker.
I have a lift chair and grab bars in the bathroom.
So we have made accommodations to this disease, but I refuse to give in to it.
It is a long journey, one I did not plan for, but one I will complete with bravery and class.
I am a tough old bird.
I will not go quietly into that night!
Hope this answers your questions.

My neurologist in Virginia said my "Executive Function" was broke in my brain.
More and more, I realize how correct she was.
I prided myself on my decision making ability.
I could take all the facts, the variables, even the emotions, and come up with a reasonable, even good, decision.
Many of the decisions I made in the Navy and working as a Civil Servant in the Navy were life and death decisions.
Hot Gun Foul Bore emergencies, shipboard fires and damage control, personnel issues relating from too much alcohol, drugs, or emotions, underway replenishment, and many other issues.
But now, decisions are difficult to come by if at all.
I have related to my readers how I have a mental safe place that I go too.
My "Cement" house on 40 acres.
My survivalist fantasy.
But I also have a cocoon fantasy also.
A continuing care facility that has the capability to meet all of my wife's and my needs.
Of course, there is also the issue of living in Florida, without close friends, and living in Virginia Beach, close to all my friends.
Then there is the issue of owning a home, with all the problems and issues that brings, or living in a senior's apartment, which also has it's own issues.
The bottom line is, I can't make a decision and that frustrates me.
There was a time, I could weight all of the pros and cons and come up with a decision.
Today, I can't decide when to go to bed.
This disease causes numerous issues.
Stiff legs and arms, pain, memory issues, emotional issues, insecurities, depression, but my inability to make a simple decision is the most debilitating to me right now.
And I do not know what to do about it!
I do know that I am not happy because I am unable to settle my mind about the future and it seems to me that things are changing faster than I can keep up with it.
As a matter of fact, I really don't know where I am in my thought process.
I guess it's good that I am not an executive anymore!

Our Church is hosting Vacation Bible Study this week.
I am a small group leader of 10 boys and girls ages 3 to 12!
You might think that would be very difficult but it is not.
The Children watch after each other and the younger children seem to emulate the older Children.
The two three year olds and I get along famously.
Why, I think because at heart, and somewhat mentally, I am a three year old at heart!
I love it.
Now, how am I doing with this extreme 4 hour drain on my energy?
So far so good.
I came home, ate a sandwich, and took a 3 hour nap!
As long as I can do that, I think I will be OK.  One thing that is difficult for me is getting up from the floor!
We sit on rugs as a small group during big assembly times.
The VBS Leader conducts this community time and she has us get up and sing and then sit down, and then get up and sing!
The Children have no issues with tis, but I do.
However, the 2 thre year olds like me to sit with them and I refuse to disappoint them.
Boy do my legs hurt tonight!
And is is only Monday!
Another issues is memory verses!
Trust me, the three year olds do better than I do!
But, I have the book!!
And, for the most part, I can read!
At least for now.
So, while I am bust for another week, I am enjoying myself serving God.
This is good.
One thing I have learned dealing with Children's Ministries over the past years is,  Children want to be treated with love, acceptance, and respect!
If you treat them this way, they return those qualities to you with interest.
Of course, Adults want to be treated with love, acceptance, and respect.
I think there is a lesson in here, somewhere!
I believe, with naps, rest, and persistence, I will make it through the week.
I know I will not give up and I will never surrender to my disease.
I will not admit defeat.
I may weaken, but I will not break.
That is how I have attacked this disease.
That along with my detached view of the disease, thinking of my symptoms as "interesting".
I intend to continue this way.
Thanks for your support.
I learned that from Bartles and James.

We have been married for over 40 years and I learn something new every day about my wife.
She is a strong, determined woman.
Intelligent and resourceful.
But she is suffering from depression and anxiety because of my disease.
She sees my disease progressing but she says nothing.
She treats me like I am healthy and without this disease, yet she protects me like the mother of a three year old!
I see her hurting.
I see her anger at the situation.
I understand why she is depressed and why she suffers from anxiety.
I know she hides her hurt and outs on a strong front.
But that front is beginning to crack.
I did not realize that until this week!
Last week was stressful because of our Grandson's surgery.
We weathered that week fairly well.
She better than I, but we survived.
This week, the toll has shown on her and me.
I wonder how I can help her.
I try to be independent, helpful, upbeat, and normal.
But I get myself in trouble for doing things that wear me out.
Again, that protective mother bear comes out.
I love my wife and I know she loves me.
We both cling to the promises of God.
I wish, more than anything that I could take away her grief, her hurt, her worry, and her pain.
But I can't.
I can only do the best I can in the shape that I am in.
Yet she is still suffering.
Again, I just realized just how much.

Today was my second visit to my new Neurologist.
He remembered me!
I am impressed.
The last Neurologist treated me for 18 months and acted each time I saw him like I was a NEW patient!
It was like that movie, "50 First Dates!"
I have been having issues with Sinemet.
It makes me drowsy, with uncontrolled yawning, nausea and even dry heaves.
My nose even runs when this hits me.
I can control the issues if I eat a massive meal before I take the Sinemet, but that has it's own growing issue.
SO I discussed this with my new Neurologist and he said; "You have Lewy Body Dementia and Sinemet does not help people with LBD.
It may even make your hallucinations worse!"
WOW!!
That is the first time I ever heard that!!
He is also taking me off another drug that is predominantly for Parkinson's!
I am impressed, someone who actually know how to treat Lewy Body Dementia.
Now I realize this is a journey and not a race.
But I am happy to have a neurologist that listens to me and seems to care about my well being.
My neurologist in Virginia was a "Bull Dog" when it came to diagnosing my disease.
She even used the University of Virginia Medical School to get a second opinion and verification of her diagnosis.
But after that, she was really done with me.
I had the disease,  it would probably lead to my demise, take your pills and shut up.
This Doctor is different.
He wants to help me find the best way to live with this disease in a manner that gives me the best quality of life!
Again, I am impressed and happy.
I don't see him again until late October.
By then, I will be off of one drug and another will be cut in half!
I believe we are on the right path!

Our youngest Grandson had major back surgery this week.
The surgery was Tuesday and lasted 7 hours!
We arrived at the hospital at 0500 and did not depart until 8PM.
Then everyday at the hospital since then.
This evening was the turning point for good.
I believe he is now on the mend.
I was helping him walk down the hallway of the ward, a typical recovery exercise, but I was little help.
His grip for steadiness on my arm caused me to be off balance and stumble.
That surprised me but it should not have.
I have enough problems walking on my own.
A few days ago, I was helping a handyman work in my bathroom and I needed to step over his leg, I crashed into a wall and only the sink prevented my fall.
The toes on my right foot are all black and blue and hurt.
Balance is no longer my strong suit.
Considering I used to be a competitive figure skater, not having balance is a new issue in my life, at least new in the last couple of years.
A big hospital is an interesting place.
This hospital is large enough to have a children's wing.
The nursing staff is very pleasant and very professional.
The facility is modern and very impressive.
They even have a game room for the children with a Wii and other video games!!
They have free Wi Fi in each room!
But the reminders of the purpose of the facility are everywhere.
CODE BLUE gets called numerous times a day!
Sad parents walking around holding eh hands of children that are much sicker that they know.
Old people being pushed in wheel chairs with little life left in their eyes.
It's a hospital!
Sick people go there.
It reminds me of my condition.
I am not as strong, not as energetic, not as alert, and not as agile, as I used to be.
I was really surprised how much strength and stamina I have lost over the last two years.
But what really impacts me is that I don't care about those things.
I don't care.
I accept  how I feel, how my mind works,  how my balance works.
It is what it is.
We had to walk a good distance from the parking garage to the room my grandson is in.
That walking has really aggravated the pain in my legs.
The push and pull muscles are really fighting each other and I am in a fair amount of pain.
I refuse to let that deter me from being with my Grandson, but I pay for it at night.
A small price to pay to support him and his parents.
So, this week has been a series of lessons for me.
A lesson on life, a lesson on pain, a lesson on the progress of my disease, and a lesson in love.
I still have a good amount of experience and love to give.
It may cost em a bit of pain, frustration, and effort to offer that experience and love, but I still intend to be her to offer it!

Yesterday, before the Baptism, we had lunch with the Pastor of the Church we attend here in Florida.
I enjoy Jon and his preaching and the meal was very enjoyable.
The topic of conversation settled on my disease and  Jon wanted to know more about the impact on me.
I was telling him various problems that I have discussed in this forum before and the topic of my loosing the ability to read came up.
He wanted to know how often those episodes happen.
My answer was not specific because I really did not know.
My wife chimed in with a very specific answer.
According to her, and she pays close attention to these things, I loose the ability to read, briefly, when I am in large groups, or where there is numerous voices reading in unison, like in Church during responsive reading,  or when I am reading Scripture for a group of people.
This information takes me back to something my Neurologist in Virginia told me.
She said, the "Executive Function"       portion of my brain no longer works correctly!
That theory makes sense.
My brain cannot sort out extraneous noise and there fore overloads and shuts down!
The same effect happened when I was under stress at work.
Early in this journey, I experienced a number of episodes where I would be driving home, and I would not know where I was, where I was going, and where I came from!
Very unnerving!
One time, I drove home to a place I had not lived in years!!
Again, under stress the "Executive Function" of my brain overloads and shuts down.
One on one, or alone, I can read, I can carry on a conversation, or even drive, for the most part.
But add a stressor and the train comes off the track!
This was a great revelation for me.
Sometimes doctors say thing that don't make sense to me.
But, now, with time, the "Executive Function" premise makes total sense.
Stress is a big negative for someone with any type of dementia.
And maybe, it is the first indicator of dementia.
That is, how does stress effect you?
Does it make your problem come into view?
Does stress cause you to become confused?
How do you perform in the absence of stress?
It is no surprise that our caretakers have the best view of our disease.
If anyone really wants to know how I am doing or how a certain symptom manifests itself, ask Linda.
She know exactly what I am going through and she can give you a reasoned description of what effects me and how that impact is displayed.
And yes, she is the one who takes the car keys when she knows, many times before me, that I am too tired, upset, stressed, to drive.
And she keeps me out of crowds as much as she can, because she understands how they effect me.
I am a blessed man.

I was at the local Methodist Church, playing Ping Pong in their activity center, and I had an opportunity to talk with Andy, my partner in LBD.
Andy is a bit farther in his journey than I am.
He no longer drives, has more difficulty walking than I do, and has more difficulty carrying on a conversation.
Yet, he exercises, enjoys people, and is very well versed in the symptoms and treatments of LBD.
In all, Andy is enjoying his life while he deals with the limiting issues of LBD.
So, he is content.
I also enjoy my life.
I do not let my medical issues dictate my happiness.
Yes, I get tired, sweaty, confused, and my muscles ache, but I still get up and go.
Like my Ping Pong outings.
I play Ping Pong with a fellow who has an advanced case of Parkinson's.
He has had the Deep Brain Stimulation surgery but his other side still shakes and he falls down sometimes because his feet get tangled.
Yet, he plays Ping Pong!
Yes, we spend plenty of time chasing the ball and picking it up is a challenge.
But, he and I play Ping Pong and have fun!!
We play three games and then rest, followed by another three games.
This goes on for two hours.
By then, we are both soaked in sweat, even though the place is air conditioned, and very tired.
But we benefit from the fellowship and exercise.
My wife and I also have a Ministry at the local Assisted Living Facility.
We lead a Bible study there every Thursday.
A few weeks ago, one of the men in the class asked me to Baptize him.
I agreed and the Pastor of the Church we attend made arrangements with the local First Baptist Church to use their Baptismal.
The activity Director from the ALF used the large, handicap equipped, van to transport 12 members of the Class to the Church for the Baptism.
It was a wonderful and meaningful time of worship.
This Ministry is yet another way of not giving in to the effects of LBD.
I learn a lot from Andy and I hope he and I set a good example for others on this LBD journey.
You can have a disease but not be HAD by the disease!
Yes there are limitations, but they can be managed if you want to.
It takes effort and changes to your routine.
But life can be very full and very rewarding if you choose that path.
I do.

We bought me a new recliner that will lift me up when I have problems getting up from a chair.
It is very comfortable, and since it sits higher than most chairs, I can get up easier even without the lift function.
So, I already like it.
The chair is entirely electric!
Recline, decline, lift, everything.
It has a heated seat and back and three speed vibrating.
My constant companion, Marcel, thinks the vibrating function is the chair growling at him.
So, I don't use it.
The electric functions of the chair are slow!
If I am sitting down, with my legs up, and I need to get up, it takes a while!
There are no quick moves.
Someone at the door, they better have patience.
Telephone ringing, Voice mail will get there before me.
I now am in slow motion.
The chair does have an emergency back-up battery in case of a power outage.
Good thing.
There has been a unforeseen benefit.
I get up less so I drink less coffee and get less snacks.
My weight and waist line will appreciate that.
And, since my new GP has already told me I need to loose weight, the chair may be a blessing.

As I have written before, my GP is being closed by Sacred Heart Medical for cost cutting issues.
It is what it is!
I also wrote about my Wile's telephone call with the folks at Sacred Heart.
well, they called back and set us up with an appointment with a doctor they thought would be a good match for me.
This doctor's practice was already full, but she made room for me after she was told about my condition.
We had a one hour appointment with the doctor this afternoon!!
That's one entire hour with her.
Not counting the time to do the paperwork, get my vitals, and wait for the doctor to see me.
I was very impressed with her.
She actually knew what Lewy Body Dementia was!!
Wow!
Now, this is not a fluke, or a coincidence.
God worked this out after much prayer from my wife and myself.
I just love it when God makes the bad that humans construct turn into good for those of us who believe.
This is a blessing.
SO, I feel better, my Wife feels better, and we have a wonderful new Family Doctor.
More to come.

<doc date=Tuesday, June 25, 2013>
Recently, I have had a few "Good" days, and as always, I am now experiencing the "Bad" days that always follow.
Each "Good" day is a little less good and each "Bad" episode is a little lower.
I expect these ups and downs, so I am not upset or unsettled over them.
They are what they are, the progression of my disease.
But a "New Feeling" has begun to invade my physical and mental being.
This new feeling does not scare me or upset me.
It is just something new that I have never felt before.
This new feeling is more like the next step on my journey.
It is also a feeling that most of you will recoil over.
But don't!
Psalm 139 written by King David, tells us all the days of our life were written in GOD's book before we were formed in our Mother's womb.
I have tole you in an earlier post, this disease will not cause me to die one moment before GOD had my homecoming planned, before I was formed.
So, do not be troubled or concerned.
I'm not.
This feeling is the feeling that this life is beginning to wind down for me.
I feel like GOD is telling me to get ready for a wonderful new chapter in my life.
The feeling comes over me mentally as a heaviness and quietness.
Physically,  I feel compressed!
That's the best description I have.
It is new and the feeling does not stay, but comes and goes.
I sense no heart of blood pressure issues and my pulse stays the same.
Yet, this feeling comes upon me.
I love the life that GOD has given me.
The good days and the bad days.
The challenges and the victories.
I have been loved for over 40 years by a great Woman.
I have a loving Son and his family.
Grandsons, great friends, wonderful, exciting experiences that most men never have.
My Navy career was my second love affair.
If I could help the Navy today, I would put on my Uniform and go to work.
This has been a great life!!
Best of all, I serve a wonderful GOD who made a way for a sinner like me to join Him in Heaven!
A Savior who paid the price for my sins and a Holy Spirit that guides me and teaches me everyday!
This has been a great life!
But the next chapter will be even more astonishing!
Lewy Body Dementia is an interesting disease.
It makes you introspective, defensive, sensitive to noises, and it robs you of your memory and mobility.
But, through all that, I still feel very secure in my Father's arms.
I have no worries, no fears, and no regrets.
And, as I have always said, I will see this through, to the end.
Why, because I am interested in seeing where LBD takes me!
I still find this disease interesting!
And this new feeling is just another interesting thing in a long journey of interesting things.
Nothing more.

As I wrote last, we had an appointment with a new Neurologist this week.
It was a good experience and I am encouraged that he will be good for us.
But, as we briefed him on my disease and how it manifested itself, I saw the grief and pain in my Wife's face.
This was the first time I ever noticed her pain.
She seemed to actually recoil at each description of a symptom as if she was actually experiencing that issue herself.
My Wife loves me!
I have always known that.
But, I never realized how deeply me having LBD has hurt her.
She is in pain over my problems.
She hides it well and when I told her about what I observed, she brushed me off.
She IS a tough person!
Many Navy deployments and workups has forged her in the crucible of stress and loneliness.
But this is a new and unexpected villain that neither of us expected and were not prepared for.
We are well into this journey yet I never really saw her grief before.
It brings a much different prospective to me.
As the one wit the disease, I focus on how it impacts and effects me.
But those negative things are actually harder for her to deal with than for me.
I know that now.
But, what do I do?
I have been told two things that impacted me.
First was from my neurologist in Virginia.
She told me that I had not dealt with my disease mentally.
I disagreed with her then, but I now totally agree and I am trying to address that issue.
Second, I was told that this disease is not all about me.
I know that is true now.
LBD effects the caregiver more than I understood and I am sorry that I did not understand that before now.
Still, I don't have an answer as to how I can change this.
But I intend to be more attentive to Her feelings and emotions.
My LBD does effect Her and I must understand that.

Today, we had an appointment with a different Neurologist.
The one I have been seeing since we moved to Florida is not a good match for me.
He just never acted like he cared about me.
This one is different!
He has a very caring staff that asks questions about your condition, how you feel, what problems you have had, while all along showing concern.
Then, the Neurologist came in the room.
Let me say up from that he is younger that my previous Neurologist.
He spent at least 30 minutes with my wife and me asking questions, listening, observing, even testing my memory.
He then asked if he could get my past records from my previous Neurologists!!
Hallelujah!!
I was sold.
As he talked, we realized he understood LBD and the ups and downs of the disease.
He discussed his plan for our future and acted like a team member not some aloof consultant.
I get the idea he is in this for the long haul and I like that.
We have another appointment in 6 weeks to permit him to get my previous records and review them.
He told us he might order some tests, but only after he determined what tests had already been done to preclude duplicating testing!
Again, Hallelujah!!
No more unrelated tests just to get the doctor a set of steak knives.
Yes, I believe this Neurologist is a keeper.

<doc date=Sunday, June 16, 2013>
I had an appointment with my Psychiatrist a week or so back.
He actually specializes in Lewy Body Dementia and Alzheimer's.
He is a middle aged gentleman with a gentle nature.
He asked me how I spend my days and I had to really think about the answer.
Since I have little desire to do anything, I could not come up with an answer.
Then, I remembered that I Surf the WEB quite a bit.
That and write the occasionally blog article and watch the Western Channel on TV!
His reply was "Good" when I told him about my computer use.
He said it was good for my mind and that I should keep it up!
That surprised me for a moment.
But, if you "Peel the onion back" surfing the Web and reading articles and emails keeps me engaged.
It beats my other pass time which I did not tell him;  Staring off into space.
Since I have not found a neurologist that cares if I live or die, and my GP is being put out of business by the hospital chain he works for, having any Doctor that remembers my name and disease is refreshing!
So, I guess the Web is my friend.

I have had difficulties getting accustomed to living in Florida.
I left a great medical team that was dedicated to helping me.
I have a great, strong, friends network.
I knew the area!
I was in a familiar area with long time friends close to me.
Finally, and most important, I had a great Church family!
Yet, we wanted to be close to our don and his family, and I will readily admit that being close to them has been very good.
But yesterday, I received a very shocking blow.
I found out that my GP, the ONE doctor that I trust in Florida, is being fired by the medical group that he works for.
That's right, Sacred Heart is closing my Doctor's office and letting him and his staff go.
Sacred Heart Hospital is firing 3000 medical personnel!
I was shocked and devastated!
Now, what am I going to do?!
My emotions ran wile yesterday.
But today, I know that I can do nothing by pray for the fine medical staff in his office and for Doctor Atkinson.
Sacred Heart does not know me or care about me.
My experience with doctors in the Pensacola area has not been good.
I do not see the quality of physicians here that I saw in Virginia.
I do not know what I am going to do.
Move back to Virginia was my first emotion.
But, that cannot happen.
I just do think another move would be good for me or my wife.
But, I do feel defeated and demoralized.
It seems, just as I am getting acclimated and comfortable, something happens to make me agitated and unhappy again.
I really do not know what to do.
I feel paralyzed!

I have always prided myself on having a good memory.
I actually used to be able to memorize the electronic, electrical and hydraulic schematics of the MK 42 Gun Mounts that I worked on.
As the old man in the "Sons of Will Sonnet" said; "No brag, just fact."
As a public speaker and as a communicator, I could tell stories about my past, including names, dates, and historical events to illustrate my point.
But LBD is robbing me of that "Steel Trap" memory.
I spend more and more time trying to remember old shipmates name, what ship I knew them at, or even where I lived.
Often when telling a "Sea Story" I cannot locate the facts or even the people involved in something I am trying to tell some one.
It is frustrating and embarrassing to me and it is starting to cause me to not try to tell stories.
Now I know some of you are very glad that I am now starting to be quite.
In some circles, it may be considered a great improvement for me.
But, I love "Sea Stories" and I believe they serve to teach others about the traditions of the Navy.
So, loosing that part of my personality is upsetting to me.
Even when writing my Navy Blog, I find it hard to make mental connections to the past.
Writing posts take longer and are somewhat thinner in details than before.
Yet, when I am "On" I still enjoy telling and writing "Sea Stories" about my Navy past.
Now remember, this blog is to document what is going on as LBD impacts my life.
And this loss of long term memory is related to that, since my memory loss has been limited to short term memory until now.
We will see how this proceeds.

I just went to our bathroom to was my hands.
The counter top seemed SO high and when I looked in the mirror, I seemed so short!
I felt small and diminished!
This is not the first time this has occurred.
Other times in the same location, I feel tall and the counter top is where I remember it being.
What is the difference since I do not believe this is an anomaly.
It could be related to the events of the last few days and how I feel about them.
Or, it could be related to how the next few days will unfold.
Otherwise, it could be a result of events or an indicator of my future mental condition.
I truly do not know.
What I do know is that this personal perspective impacts me.
Again, I wonder if any of you experience this phenomenon.
Or maybe,  am just moving on to the next level of LBD.

Today, we decided we would take out 7 bushes on the left side of our driveway and plant grass.
It will be easier to take care of because weeding is not on my dance card!
So, we went to Lowes and bought a few bags of dirt, grass seed, and a bench that seats two for me and Marvel on the back porch.
When we got home, my wife and I moved the bench to the back porch.
I should have stayed there.
After that we started to dig out the bushes.
My neighbor, who does SO much for me, wanted three of the bushes I was getting rid of to replace three of his that did not make it.
So, I decided to remove his dead bushes and transplant where good looking ones of mine.
It was warm and humid, and I lasted about five minutes!
I quickly went in because I was going to quickly meet the ground if I did not.
A few minutes of the cool of the air conditioning and a glass of water and I felt better.
We ate lunch and the sun became obscured by some heavy clouds.
So, we went back to try again.
This time, we succeeded.
Three bushes successfully transplanted in my neighbor's yard.
I did not do anything else and there are four more bushes to dig out before I can spread the dirt and plant some grass.
That will wait until tomorrow.
I did go in and take a cool shower and after a hour or so, I stopped pouring sweat!
The rest of my day has been inside, being my wife's sour chef.
Dinner was wonderful and we made some things we have never made before.
We enjoy cooking together.
But, I am exhausted!
I will be in bed soon and I hope I sleep better than I did last night.
The bottom line is, I always think I can do something, just as I did years ago.
And just as quickly, I realize that LBD has taken away my ability to be strong, active, or resilient.
It angers me and I have been in a huff all night because of it.
I hate to ask for help.
My son and his family have their plate way over full!
And, in my mind, I should be self reliant.
I really need to just admit, I am not 30 anymore!

I used to have many things that interested me.
For instance, I was an avid car NUT!
I was always at the Virginia Beach New Car show on the first day!
It did not matter how cold it was or how wet.
I was there.
Just think, ever new auto manufactured for sale in North America, open for me to sit in, try on, peruse!
We have bought more vehicles that "Little Joe's" used car lots!
Cars were an extension of my personality.
They reflected where I was mentally at the time of purchase and what was important at that time.
Now, while I still pay attention to cars, They have lost their allure.
There are other things that have gone the same way as automobiles.
It seems, the things I was passionate about are just not that important.
The things I liked to do, are no longer fun or they require too much effort.
I mentioned earlier about travel.
In the past, I would ump in the car and go!
Now, I would rather stay home.
Another passion of mine was houses.
I could have saved a lot of money if I had applied for my Virginia Real Estate License in 1983!
The other side of that is, I made a lot of money for one particular Real Estate Agent.
We have owned and lived in seven homes since 1983!
Not to mention three apartments.
I really DO know what the Old Testament Israelites went through during their 40 years in the desert!
Well, no more.
The thought of moving terrorizes me.
If I sell this house, it will sell furnished, as is!
I was an avid shooter.
I loved shooting fire arms of any kind.
I competed, not very successfully, in IDPA matches.
Belonged to a Gun Club.
Took friends shooting and taught their kids how to shoot.
Now, it is too mush effort.
It's just interesting looking back at what I filled my time with then and what I fill my time with now.
I had a Doctor's appointment a few days ago and he asked me;  "How do you fill your days?"
I really could not answer him!
I looked like the IRS head when asked by Congress why he went to the White House 153 times in four years.
His reply; "The Easter Egg Roll"!
I finally said, surf the web and watch TV.
The Western Channel and the Military Channel are my favorites.
No home improvement shows because that means future WORK.
No, the past is where I am most comfortable.
This is just a review of where I was and where I am now.
I find the progression of this disease interesting, still.

I have noticed a new problem chewing anything.
I have always eaten quickly and now I have to slow down and eat smaller bites to prevent me from aspirating my food.
I have had this problem for a while, but now I am actually locking my teeth together when my lower jaw closes out of alignment with my upper teeth.
I have noticed this a few times, recently my lower jaw moved and my front teeth actually weaved together.
It was unnerving and I was afraid that I was going to break an incisor.
I did not but this is going to be an issue.
I notice it now, but I will not later.
Also, during the recent chewing issues, I snapped a crown off of the first molar on mu mower left side.
Until this moment, I did not associate it with the chewing issue but it might be.
I will have to slow down and chew small bites of food.
This is like teaching me to do ballet!
But, I will try to dance through my meals.
If any of you have this issue or one similar, please let me know.
Thanks!

I need exercise, I get that.
So, a friend of mine who has Parkinson's and I play Ping Pong at a local Church recreational center a couple of times a week.
It is good exercise!
Yes it is!
Bending over to pick up the ball, chasing the ball across the gym floor, crawling under tables to get the ball, are all very good exercise.
Especially if you do it for two hours!
I leave there drenched in sweat and very tired.
After our strenuous, exhaustive, workout sessions, we sometimes go out to eat lunch.
Yesterday was one of those days.
We went to a local Chinese Restaurant.
First let me say, this "Greasy Spoon" should be closed by the Health Department!
I did not eat much of my chicken chow mien, because the meat did not resemble any chicken meat I have ever seen!
It probably was a domestic animal that went "Meow".
I can't prove that but I don't eat anything that I can't identify!
As we were getting ready to leave, my friend tried to stand up and immediately lost his footing.
He is a full size man and I had great difficult keeping him from hitting the floor or the table top.
He was not aware that his foot had fallen asleep as we sat.
The incident really unnerved him and me as well.
Try as we might, Parkinson's and Lewy Body Dementia both take our mobility away.
It is an insidious disease and it impacts the sufferer slowly.
Then, when you are feeling pretty good, POW, you are incapacitated by the movement disorder.
He has had one Deep Brain Stimulation device implanted in his brain and it stopped the shaking on one side.
But, nothing will restore the strength and balance that these diseases take from us.
I am hard headed and I don't use my cane all the time.
I should, and I am going to try to remember to do just that.
But, because of my memory issues and probably my hard headed nature, I probably won't until I fall and hurt myself.
But my friend's almost fall was a wake up call for me.
I hope.
But, like my friend, I am always trying to "be normal".

My wife and I lead a Bible study at an Assisted Living Facility near us.
I truly enjoy this weekly event.
I connect with the people in the Bible study and have established a friendly relationship with them.
Last week, my wife was worn out and I volunteered to lead the Bible study alone.
She agreed and I drove the few blocks to the Facility.
The Bible study started about 15 minutes late because of a small retirement party for one of the cooks.
I took my usual 35 minutes for the study and then spent some time talking with the group.
I then pushed one of the group to her room in her wheel chair and talked with her for a few minutes.
As I got back to the car, I checked my cell phone and there were two missed calls from home!
I was concerned.
I called my wife and she was very concerned about my safety and location.
I drove home and was met by a very concerned wife.
I was late, I did not call, and she could not get me on my cell phone!
Her concerns were not wrong.
I was 30 minutes later than I would have been if the timing was exactly on point.
I did not call, because I always leave my cell phone in the car to preclude it interrupting the Bible study.
She had every reason to be concerned.
Obviously, I was not concerned because I was not in tune with the time.
I thought I was well within a time frame that she would be comfortable with.
The point here is, 10 years ago this would not have been an issue.
But today, with LBD, where I go, what I do, and when I am supposed to be home IS an issue.
Naturally, auto accidents are an issue.
Now, I still drive well, but I do get tired easily.
I do have hallucinations, but I know they are just that.
I have not seen something that I actually think is real.
Although, my hallucinations are very realistic.
They just don't fit into reality.
For instance, I saw a horse walking across our backyard a few days ago.
It was a white horse with brown patches.
It was very realistic but my backyard is fenced in and I don't have a horse!
So, I discounted the horse as not real.
The bottom line is I understand how my actions would cause my wife to be worried, upset, and even angry.
I have to be more careful to keep her informed of my whereabouts.
But, I am seldom away from her and that was one of the very few events I drove without her.
99% of the time, she is with me or I am with someone else.
Just the same, my condition must drive my actions.
I actually see her point and I feel sorry for the worry I caused her.
Caretakers have a difficult responsibility that never ends.
There are no vacations from the responsibility for care of your loved one.
Additionally, I can be difficult to live with.
I have personal issues and memory lapses that effect my  judgement and behavior.
I want thing the way I want them.
So, I know I am difficult but I also don't act this way on purpose.
I know this sounds wrong, but trust me, it is how LBD effects me.
So caretakers,  those of us with LBD do appreciate you and your constant care even if we don't tell you.

When my Father in Law was in the nursing home with Alzheimer's, in the late 1980's and early 1990's, I learned from observation that even in a deteriorating health condition, people find life precious.
I watched these people who lived in less than good conditions.
clinging to any part of life.
Just being able to sit in their chair, in the warmth of the sun was wonderful.
There were people always sitting near the front door just to greet someone new and have a brief conversation.
Meals were the highlight of the day and the simplest fare was savored!
They wanted to live life to the fullest!
Now, 22 years later, it is I who has Dementia and deals with life.
While I suffer from periods of grumpiness, depression, and rage, I still find great pleasure in doing this with and for others.
Relationships are very important.
I have written before about how much I enjoy talking with old friends and shipmates.
I enjoy utilizing email and Facebook to keep in touch with friends and family.
And, even though I am far away from my friends in the Tidewater area, they keep in touch with me and I appreciate that.
The last few days have been difficult for me.
My mood has been dark and I have had problems finding anything positive in my life!
Today, the sun rose on my mood!
I enjoyed an early telephone call from my best friend in Virginia Beach.
We spent 45 minutes on the telephone just being together!
Later in the day, I received an email from a very good Navy friend who will be coming to visit me the second week in June.
These two events set me up for a good emotional day.
I actually enjoyed completing a couple of chores around the house.
Then, this evening, my son called and needed my help repairing a bi-fold closet door.
Wow, I was really happy.
I had worth, if just for that moment.
We accomplished our task quickly with only ONE trip to the store and only ONE trip back to my house for tools!!
That was a very successful repair job.
Then, since things went so well, my son and I stopped and had an ice cream sundae!
Yes, today has been a good day and I needed one after the last few days.
It is times like these that I appreciate the up and down symptoms of LBD.
I was severely down for a couple of days, and then, as quick as I sank into my gloom, I was again engaged with people, using my skills, and being as active as I can be.
Yes, this has been a good day.

I had a scheduled visit with my Neurologist today.
Instead of my wife and care giver going with me, my Son accompanied me.
The purpose of this change was to permit my son to experience my Neurologist's manner and also to have him get a little more familiar with my disease.
My Neurologist was his usual detached, scatterbrained self.
As usual, he treated me as if this was our first meeting!
He marveled at the pill chart my wife provides even though she give him one every visit.
He was even surprised at the typed page with all my issues over the last four months!
In all, he was not prepared and did not know who I was.
He also aggravated me by continually talking as if I had Parkinson's disease!
I finally got vocal and straightened him out on that.
He dd not address the fact that I have been having troubles eating, choking, and aspirating.
Nor did he address the fact that one of these events lead to a severe asthma attack!
I told him I almost passed out.
No reply!
He did run out of the room twice to check on things.
My son was not impressed.
Everyone in the medical field keeps telling me he is the best Neurologist in the Pensacola area.
Pensacola is in serious trouble!
He has NEVER looked at the records from my Virginia Beach Neurologist!
We asked him directly if he had reviewed those records and he said;  No, Why would I!?
That was the last visit.
I should have known then he was not the doctor for me.
My GP here read my records from my GP in Virginia Beach and told me he thought those were the best written medical records he had ever seen.
When I go see my GP, he is on track where I am and what I have gone through!
My wife has now moved to my GP!
So, with this as my basis for a decision, we are looking for a new Neurologist.
I am strongly considering going to the Naval Hospital or the VA for treatment.
They can't be any worse!
This is symptomatic of our move to Florida.
I always thought moving to Florida would expose me to doctors accustomed to older people.
I was mistaken.
The first dentist we went to was a lecher!
He told my wife she had good looking legs!
She does, but that is not what a dentist should be looking at!
My wife's GP was afraid to touch her as was the first dermatologist we went to.
And I am finally fed up with this Neurologist.
Trust me I am not hard to please.
But I would like to be treated like I was there before.

Our Grandsons are staying with us this week.
We both love having them here.
They are truly exceptional young men.
Of course, they are aware of my disease and the issues it causes.
Yet, they have not really been exposed to the effects of this disease.
They see me in the day tie, for a short period of time, when I am doing well.
But, as they learned last evening, nights are different.
I have addressed the "Sun Downer" issues before but they have become more dramatic in the last few months.
As I have also shared before, routine is very important to my mental well being.
I started this blog last Monday, I think.
Since then, I have been through the busiest and stressful week I have had in a very long time.
The Grandsons staying with us all week has been great.
I enjoy their company.
However, having two teenagers in the house at the same time is something I never experienced before.
Keeping up with them is a mental, emotional, and physical drain.
Don't get me wrong, they did nothing wrong.
They are just teenagers!
The other thing is my routine has been blown out the window!!
No naps, everyday busy, no down time, up late, up early, wow, I am beat.
No, I will be glad to have my routine back.

As my LBD journey progresses, I have noticed a number of symptoms increasing.
One of them is my memory.
There are times that my mind is completely blank.
I have no thought on my mind at all.
Other times, I am focused on the past events of my life.
I still have very realistic dreams that run over into my waking hours.
Some of them have me believing that I am still working and have not retired from Civil Service.
In these dreams, I have been notified that I have been approved to retire, but I just can't seem to retire.
I have too much to do!
Every night, when I lay down, I try to remember what I did during the day.
Most of the time, I don't remember the events of the day.
I can't remember if we went anywhere, of what we had to eat.
I don't remember names of people I meet now and I have problems remembering the names of the people I knew in the past.
Shipmates, folks I worked with, even family members.
This frustrates me and I often ask my wife the name of this person or that.
Of all the things I have lost, I miss my memory the most!
It's true!
It's bad enough I live some of my day in a dream world, but to forget the names of people I have known for years, old friends and shipmates, is difficult to deal with.
People with Dementia put on a "Show" to cover up their memory problems.
We pretend to know someone or pretend we remember a situation or event.
We smile, say "Yes" and agree with you.
But we really don't know what you are talking about!
It's the truth.
I watched my Father in Law do this when he had Alzheimer's and I do it now.
I never though I would be in this condition.
So, as this "Long Good By", as President Reagan called it, continues, I have become more and more frustrated with my memory loss.
It is the most difficult effect of LBD for me.

<doc date=Wednesday, May 8, 2013>
I have noticed that I have lost strength and stamina.
I have written recently about difficulties getting off the sofa.
But I had noticed problems even before that with stamina and strength.
For instance, my wife and I used to walk for hours covering miles.
Now, I get very tired after a 20 or 30 minute walk.
My thought is that this is from the LBD.
All of the data I can find backs that up.
But I also wonder if my stamina and strength issues are from not wanting to walk or do much else.
I know inactivity causes muscle loss and lack of exercise will cause loss of stamina.
So, I intent to increase my physical activity.
Yes, I will start slow at first and I know I will never get back to where I was before LBD.
But, I still think I can be better than I am now.
The journey for someone with LBD is somewhat uncharted.
I find very little feedback from others with this disease even though the LBD Association say this is a very prominent disease.
But there seems to be very little first hand information from the patients.
That is one of the reasons I write this Blog.
I will keep you postted on my progress.

<doc date=Saturday, May 4, 2013>
Today, we went looking for new living room furniture.
I know, I change couches like most people change socks.
Well, you could say the same thing about my automobile trades!
But this was different.
I can no longer get out of our couch easily.
It sets low and tilted back, so I have to slide to the edge and then get up.
On bad days, I need help.
So, we purchased one of those lift chairs.
It reclines, it vibrates, it heats, and it lifts me up when I need it.
Then, we found a chair that is equally comfortable for my wife.
It has power recline with infinite positioning and a power lumbar support!
She cannot wait until it is delivered.
She is excited as I am!
My chair is a concession to my condition.
A tool to help me do as much as I can.
That still is my goal, to be as active as I possibly can as long as I can.
Canes, Walkers, Lift Chairs, Power Chairs, anything to keep moving and doing!
That's why I take the fist full of prescription drugs that I do and that is why I will continue to be tough.

This morning, I was enjoying my typical toast and coffee when I aspirated some toast.
The choking and coughing brought on a serious Asthma attack.
How serious?
No air in!
I could not take a breath because my lungs were blocked by the tubes being in spasm.
I have not had an Asthma attack since I had Bronchitis last winter and ended up in the Emergency Room.
Luckily, my inhaler was close and a few shots of Albuteral and I was breathing again.
I bring this up because aspiration is the number one cause of death in LBD patients according to the LBD Association WEB site.
It is something I am aware of but I eat so fast, from habit, that I often aspirate and choke.
This is the first time that choking has lead to an asthma attack.
I will have to alter my eating habits.
But that will be hard.
The first ship I was on in the Navy had a Mess Decks that seated 45 men,  The Enlisted Crew was 350 and we had 45 minutes for any meal!
You learned to eat fast!
So, that is the latest problem related to the progression of my Lewy Body Dementia.
If you have LBD or are a caregiver for a LBD patient, be on the lookout for this problem.

<doc date=Tuesday, April 30, 2013>
When I was young, I always wondered why when older folks got together, the topic ALWAYS turned to their ailments, medicines, and Doctor's visits.
Now I know!
It is because their pain, they disease, their schedule of medicines, is always with them, in the forefront of their lives.
In my case, my LBD rules my life.
I am now in constant pain from the Parkinson's portion of my disease.
My short term memory is "Shot" according to my Neurologist and that is a direct quote.
Seems funny to me that someone with 8 years or more of college and 20 plus years of medical practice could not come up with a better term than "Shot"!
But the point is, I am always dealing with the effects of LBD.
When I was younger, the Navy, women, cars, beer, NASCAR, the next liberty port, were the first thoughts in my mind.
Then, I did not take 23 prescription drug pills a day.
Then I could take over the counter cold remedies, now I can't.
I used to remember when I took that over the counter cold remedy, now I can't remember when I took my medicines.
I used to remember my wife's name, now, sometimes I forget it.
Then my legs only hurt when I worked out too much, now, they hurt all the time.
Get the idea, LBD has taken over my life!
Another interesting revelation, those of us with a long term or degenerative disease want to connect with others who suffer from the same issues.
Why, good question.
It is my theory that we want to learn more about our condition from someone suffering the same issues.
Additionally, we want to learn what is next from those who are further into the journey than us.
And finally, we want to feel normal.
And since our new normal is the disease, we want to connect with fellow sufferers.
If I tell my Grandsons what I am feeling, they are concerned but not empathetic.
They have no point of reference.
Even my wife cannot fully appreciate how I feel.
Just like I have no idea ow difficult or painful child birth is.
Now you are starting to get it!
So, don't get angry wit us if we are excited to find someone taking the same meds.
And don't roll your eyes when we break out our pill charts to compare.
Lastly, remember that we are always on the lookout for someone, just like us, to commiserate with.
That connection make us feel normal.

Lewy Body Dementia is known for it's on again, off again, characteristics.
One day or one hour you feel fine.
Your mind is working well,  you are conversing with people, doing something physical, what ever is normal, and then, the next thing you know, you forget who you are talking too, forget how to read, different words come out of your mouth, and you can't control your muscles!
This is, Lewy Body Dementia.
I once was a tough guy, afraid of nothing, self assured, confident.
Now, I am different.
My wife and I lead a Bible Study at a local Retirement Community.
We have about ten seniors that love GOD's word and are eager to study His Word.
I truly enjoy this Ministry opportunity but it is taxing for me.
Last Thursday, I was reading the Bible verse we were to study when, out of the blue, I could not read!
This is not a new symptom, but it is getting more frequent.
The problem passed and I recovered.
My Wife noticed my problem and was concerned.
After the study, we discussed this latest issue and came to an agreement as to how we will deal with it in the future.
It will happen again.
The folks in the Bible study do not know of my disease and I do not want to burden them with my issues.
I am there to uplift them, not give them something to worry about.
Even in my weakness, I am a tough guy!

The late comedian, George Carlin, used to have a routine about women being used as a "Science Experiment" with the use of birth control pills.
He said; "One day you will wake up with one leg shorter than the other, and then they will say there is a problem."
I was recently prescribed Excelon patches and we used them as directed for about 8 weeks.
We stopped the use because I developed a lasting rash on the site of the applications.
We notified my Neurologist but he never returned the call.
Since then, I developed something in my scalp that my GP wanted a Dermatologist to look at.
He seemed concerned, and the Dermatologist was even more concerned.
He questioned me repeatedly about having radiation treatment!
I never have, so he was really perplexed and he took a biopsy.
He said it looked like some sort of melanoma.
I do not remember the type.
Melanoma of the scalp is the hardest to treat and the fastest growing and fastest to metastasize.
Now, I believe it will come back as nothing but a funny mole.
But if it does not, can it be caused by the Excelon patches or another powerful drug that I am taking?
The fact is, all of us who have Dementia are being used as a science experiment without our permission.
I checked for any information on line and surprise, there are a number of large studies that ended with the conclusion that the Excelon patch does not cause melanoma.
Then the question arises, why did they do such big studies?
Did the suspect something?
And, who funded the studies?
The people who made the drug perhaps?
The bottom line is, there must be some concern over the effects of Excelon patches.
And, no, we did not place the patch on my head.
But neither did the 6300 plus subjects of the study I found!
So the researcher must have had a reason to study melanoma in those who use the Excelon patch.
But then again, who cares if a few Dementia sufferers develop melanoma.
They are going to die soon anyway!
And we are very expensive to take care of in the later stages of the disease.
So, it would be more economical to have Dementia patients to die earlier that later.
I know I may sound paranoid or even conspiratorial,  but I do feel that there is a desire to dispatch those of us who are now a burden to the society.
For instance, we have a friend at Church that is 72.
Medicare has denied a skin biopsy of an area his Dermatologist is very concerned about.
This individual has has numerous skin cancer outbreaks.
But, Medicare said he was too old to receive the procedure!
So you can see where my concern comes from.
So, while I wait for the results of my recent biopsy, I wonder what other medical issues will be caused by the medicines I take.
Maybe I will wake up one morning with one leg shorter than the other!
Then I'll know!

Our trip to the Alabama Gulf Coast Zoo was rained out last Saturday so we doubled up this weekend.
Saturday, we attended the Average Joe's Car Show in Crestview Florida.
It was a glorious event if you are an aficionado of pre-1980 cars as I am.
Every type of car was there.
Original cars, untouched by the customizer and just as presented in the showroom many years ago.
Some, very customized vehicles.
And some cars that do not look like they ever did before!
We took our middle Grandson since he is "Car Crazy" like I am.
He took plenty of photos and was asked to stop drooling on a number of cars!
So was I.
He and I especially enjoyed the "Burn Out" contest!
If you have never witnessed this massive display of horsepower and testosterone,  you need to!
The smoke from the burn outs was so intense they had a swamp boat on a trailer to blow the smoke away!
It was awesome and I enjoyed it.
I was also glad I had my trusty walker.
I was able to sit down when I wanted to or needed to.
Today, we got up bright and early and too our youngest Grandson to the Alabama Gulf Coast Zoo.
It is a privately owned zoo and has a very good collection of big cats.
They also have a very interesting offering.
For a small fee, you can sit in an enclosure with two young Lemur's!
They were very friendly and, after a period of getting accustomed to us, they crawled into our laps, on our heads, and took small treats, provided by their keeper, from our hands.
It was a very exciting and enjoyable experience.
Having grown up next to Puritas Springs Park and idolizing "Jungle Larry Tetzloff", animal encounters have always been a passion of mine.
This Zoo offers opportunities to touch and experience animals most people will never see.
It is wonderfully done and I recommend it!
These two events have left me feeling spent.
Linda and I knew those would be physically and mentally challenging for me, and it has been.
But, it is important that I stay connected and enjoy as much good tie as I can with my family.
That's why we moved to Florida and I intend to do as much as I can.
But, we both know we will have to deal with the exhaustion that these outings cause.
But boy was this a good weekend.

OK, to you, that may not be a big deal.
To me, it is monumental!!
I have never talked to someone, in person, who had LBD.
I met him at the Sound Side  Gulf Breeze United Methodist Church which has a wonderful community center.
I go there to play Ping Pong with a friend who as Parkinson's.
Ping Pong is fun and good exercise for us.
Most of the exercise is from chasing the ball when we miss, bending over to pick it up, and kneeling down to retrieve the ball from a corner or from under furniture!
We get a great workout!
I really work up a big sweat!
In any case, this gentleman was watching us play and we asked him if he wanted to join in.
He was reticent but we encouraged him to join in the fun and he finally did.
He moved stiffly so I knew he had some issues.
Then, his wife came up and we all began talking.
The topic of my friends and my diseases came up because of the exercise issues.
The wife was amazed that they had met another person with LBD and so was I!
We spent about 15 minutes comparing symptoms ans problems.
We even had fun discussing our hallucinations!
It was fun!
It was exciting, and it was liberating!!
For quite a while, I have felt alone, maybe even freakish, to be the only one with this disease.
Even my GP Doctor did not know about LBD!!
Now, I know another human with this disease.
OK, I can see your eyes rolling back in your head!!
But this is truly a monumental moment for me.
Now, If I could just get a blood relative to talk to me!
Oh, well, I can't have everything.

Fear is a common emotion of an individual.
The Navy taught me to manage fear and use it as a positive motivator.
I was a Gunner's Mate, working with ordnance from rifles and pistols to "Oh my goodness" weapons!
Every time we exercised our weapons, we placed our lives in mortal danger.
Just teaching someone to shoot a rifle or a pistol places the instructor in mortal danger.
I had a Midshipman place a loaded 1911A1 pistol in my stomach.
How, his weapon malfunction ed and he raised his hand.
I approached him from behind and asked him what was wrong.
He turned around before I could grab him and with the gun in my stomach and his finger on the trigger, he said;  "This pistol won't fire."
I grabbed the slide of the pistol, took it from him, pointed it over the stern and fired the gun!!
From that day on, I grab anyone on the firing line by the shoulders when I approach them from behind before I ask any questions.
But now, I face fears that are different that ever before.
I am developing a fear of being alone.
Not in the case of loosing my wife because I just don't address that in my fears.
But alone, anywhere, but mostly at home.
I constantly have to know where my wife is in the house.
If she leaves a room, I need to know where she is going.
This must drive her crazy!
But, i feel very insecure if I am alone or think that I am alone.
I realize that I can't live alone anymore.
We figured that out a few weeks ago and my Neurologist confirmed that in our last appointment.
But alone, makes me feel very vulnerable.
This is totally contrary to my personality before being diagnosed with LBD and the recent progression of my disease.
My Military training and experience as a Gunner's Mate made me a decisive, independent, self-sufficient, individual.
Now, not so much.
So, what do we do?
I don't know right now.
My thought is that we will have to play this by ear.
My wife will have the end decision.
For now, I want to keep my independence and be able to stay home, alone, for a few hours when my wife goes out.
I will keep you posted.

Have you cleaned your attic out lately?
Have you shredded the tax returns from 30 years ago or all the checks you ever wrote?
How about those Christmas decorations that went with your silver rotating Christmas Tree?
Or the toys from your Son and Daughter's youth that they don't want now that the are 40 years old?
Or, are you going to leave that mess to your kids and strangers to sort through.
I have written about having your legal affairs in order, but there are house cleaning issues each of us must take care of before we go home.
Leaving this to others is simply wrong.
Our survivors will be upset enough having to deal with our loss and the funeral arraignments.
So, we have started culling old files, tax returns, memorabilia, clothes, and anything else we have not used recently.
Now, we have moved a fair number of times, so we have done this exercise recently, yet my Wife keeps bring out old Day Planners from 1999 and later that She now thinks it would be safe to discard!
Honest, if you need encouragement to get this started, watch a couple issues of "Hoarding"!!
If that does not get you started, you are in need of counseling.
For instance, we have a stash of Christmas, Anniversary, and Birthday cards that we have given each other that dates back to 1973!!!
We have not looked at these cards since they were first given!
But, getting rid of them is difficult.
But, we are going to try, soon.
You may be surprised just how big your house is.
And, you just might be able to get your car into the garage!
When is the last time that happened?
Cleaning, culling, and discarding can be good for you and for your living environment.
You may find something you wanted but misplaced long ago.
Maybe even money stuffed in an old Birthday Card!

One of the things that my wife I have learned about LBD is that I must remain connected to life.
My natural tendency since the disease has progressed is to stay in my home, which is my cocoon, sleep, watch television, and have as little contact with people as I can.
My wife knows this is not good for me.
It can lead to faster deterioration of my mental capabilities and physical abilities.
So, she keep me going!
Not everyday, as we did when we first retired, but a couple of times a week, we go somewhere, see something, talk to new people, and experience something new.
We like Zoos so we are going to the Alabama Zoo this weekend.
There is a local car club's car show next week.
We will go to a cemetery to take photos of more graves for Find A Grave, my wife's hobby next Tuesday.
See the pattern here?
Another exercise she has involved me in is leading a weekly Bible study at a local Assisted Living Facility.
I truly love being with those folks.
We are pretty much on the same mental level and the group truly enjoys the time together.
This is the most enriching time for me.
The other endeavor she has involved me in is Blogging.
This Blog, my Navy Blog, and a Christian Blog keep me connected to my memories.
I also belong to some Navy groups on Facebook.
This is a way I can keep in touch with old shipmates and relate past experiences to members of those groups.
Staying mentally active is the best way to combat the mental decline that Dementia causes.
Yes, I have issues with memory failures, short term memory, hallucinations, even reading and speech, but we choose to concentrate on what I can do instead of what I can't.
The same with physical activity.
I am weaker than I have ever been, can't stand long, sweat profusely at the slightest exertion, and get exhausted quickly.
So, I take my rotolator when we go for long walks and use my cane for the shorter trips.
I don't drive every time we go or I drive there and she drives home.
Yes, I still drive, but I know a time will come when I can't.
But again, concentrating on what we can do is the answer.
If you have LBD or are a caregiver of someone who does, get them moving, involved, and using the mental and physical capabilities they DO have.
Use it or loose it!

My loving wife is My Keeper and she is as dedicated to my well being as she is to our marriage.
I am truly a blessed man!
We had a discussion today on what I am feeling and how I believe I am progressing.
I initiated this discussion and it was very productive for both of us.
If you are a caregiver or someone diagnosed with a Dementia, it will serve both of you well to have these frank discussions.
The point of this discussion from my point was to discuss how I am dealing with the fact that I have LBD.
Seems easy, but you may remember that my Neurologist back in Virginia Beach told me that I had NOT yet dealt with my disease.
At that time I disagreed with her, but now, after dealing more with this issue, I know she was very correct.
In any case, last nights period of "Up Late" was a period of reflection for me and I wanted to let my Wife know the outcome.
You may also remember that I wrote recently that I had had my first hallucination that I thought was real.
I saw my constant companion, my Poodle, scampering out of the master bath i and under our bed.
Then I walked into the living room and saw him sitting next to my wife.
I asked how long he had been there and she said, since I left the couch!
This event came up in our discussion and she said that it was NOT the first time I saw something I thought was real.
It seems I watched a suspicious person in an optometrist office awhile back.
I even told my wife when we got in the car that I was keeping an eye on him.
She told me today, he was not there!
I was watching an empty chair.
I am really glad I did not try to pick a fight with that fellow!
She never told me about that event until today.
My wife also told me she noticed the progression of my dementia and that her goal was to keep me active and engaged in life as much as possible.
She plans outings that interest me and challenge me.
For instance, we are going to a local car show next weekend.
Now this is a great sacrifice for my wife.
She is NOT a car nut.
I on the other hand, get very excited around classic cars.
She knows this and uses this event and other things that interest me, to keep me engaged and connected to life.
The point of this post is two fold.
First, as in any relationship, constant, open, truthful, unguarded, two way, communications is paramount to the success of the relationship.
We practice this now and really have over our 40+ years of marriage.
Second, I truly have an amazing wife who is dedicated to my well being.
She monitors everything about my mental and physical health and is proactive in protecting me and my dignity.
And, she knows the score, as my Dad used to say, about my disease and how it will impact my remaining days.
She has her hands full, but she never complains.
Instead, she makes sure the road we face together is as smooth as possible.
Thanks, My Love.

Here I am, the Television is off, only one light on in the living room, it is quiet, the dog is asleep next to me, and my wife is off to bed and fast asleep.
I cannot sleep right now.
My body just feels out of sorts.
My legs hurt, I feel bloated, and I am uncomfortable.
I have checked every sight I watch and looked at the Facebook posts from the groups I follow.
My mind turns to old ships and old shipmates.
I remember the places we have been, the things we have done, and the accomplishments that made us special.
Gun shoots that went well and those that did not.
Ports of call, and nights at sea.
Rough weather and calm seas.
I can see their faces, hear their voices, smell the odors of the ship in my nostrils.
I feel the rocking of the ship under my feet and I am at home.
USS Mullinnix, USS Stein, USS Leftwich, USS Caron, USS Coral Sea, all a part of my past and a part of my todays.
I am much more comfortable in this place than I am in the world that I live in today.
I see something on the television that reminds me of a memory of my past and I chuckle.
Or a name pops into my mind and I can see that shipmate and remember where we were when...
Most of what I think of means nothing to those around me, but it brings great comfort to me.
You see, there was a time when I did great things, lead men into danger, and challenged my mental and physical abilities to their limits!
There was a time when my energy was limitless, my strength, epic, and my endurance unending.
There were days that went on for 48 and 72 hours.
Meals eaten on the run, and dangers faced that now seem superhuman to those who never saw what we actually did.
I could do almost anything and did.
Now nothing works as it did.
My mind or my body.
There was a time, before my memory failed and my body weakened, that I was a part of something bigger than me.
An organization that stood for Duty, Honor, Commitment.
I served a purpose.
Now, changing the gas bottle on my grill tires me out and I cannot remember the password for my accounts.
Then, I remembered the electronic and hydraulic prints for the most advanced Naval Gun of it's time.
Now, I only remember what I was and lament at what I have become.
If you would have told me, 20 years ago,  that I would be in this physical and mental state, I would have told you I would rather be dead.
Now, I cling to life, to my memories,  to what I was, knowing that time is precious and short.
Doctors, pills, tests, diagnosis, all lead to one place.
I am a science experiment now.
Something for the medical community to try their theories on.
I can see their minds work as they think, what pill can we try now?
They know none of them really work, but they enjoy the challenge of testing their theories on me.
The Doctors remind me of myself when I was trying to diagnose why the Gun quit firing.
The only difference is, I was in danger of blowing up the entire ship and killing countless men.
The Doctors are only in danger of killing me and they know I will no longer blow up.
It seems that I am inert!
Oh well, I still have my memories to cherish.

We got up at 6AM!
We went to our Church to help set up for a community Easter Egg hunt.
This is a wonderful outreach to our community.
Then, to keep me from being overwhelmed by large crowds, we went home before the children arrived.
Yesterday, we finally found the perfect tool chest for the garage.
I wanted a wide tool chest that provided enough drawers for all my tools, large and small, and a chest that provided a work bench top.
We found it at Home Depot!
It fit in the back of our Forrester and my Son helped me unload it from the car.
Today after setting up for the Easter Egg Hunt, I moved into my new tool chest/  Now, ALL my tools are organized!
Then, I decided to hang my Navy plaques in the garage.
I have a few in my den, but I had quite a few still in boxes in the garage.
Since I have decided we will be living here for a long time, I wanted to get this last bit of unpacking done.
I must admit, this went smoother than I thought, but I did experience some difficulty because I was experiencing arm weakness.
Standing on a ladder, driving dry wall screws into plywood and 2 by 4's gave me some strength issues.
But, it is done also.
Why do I write this diary to you?
Well, for one reason, a good, productive, day is rare for me and I was surprised that I did so much.
Yes, I sweated profusely.
Yes, I only worked about three hours in the garage.
Yes, I took a 4 hour nap after.
Am I now stiff and sore, yes.
Did I agrivate my back, yes.
But it was a good day.
Second, I know that good days are almost always followed by bad days, and even downturns in my mental and physical condition.
So, while I enjoyed this day, I am weary of what tomorrow will bring.
We will see.

There are two conflicting thoughts that constantly go on in my mind.
This conflict has been gaining strength for a while.
How long, I don't actually know.
The first train of thought is an old one.
For many years, I have wanted to be independent, a survivalist, or as they are now called, a prepper.
I wanted to live on 40 or so acres, in a concrete house, with a under ground bunker.
Self sustained including making my own electricity.
Alone, just my wife and I.
No television, telephone, cell phone, computer, no connection to the world.
Independent, self sufficient, secure!
I have written about this dream before.
Then there is the thought of living in a Continuing Care Facility that is able to deal with all of my needs.
Meals, apartment cleaning, medications, exercise, entertainment, transportation, medical needs, everything.
Now you can see the conflict!
These two thoughts are diametrically opposed to each other!
We have looked at facilities like the one I describe.
Again, I have written about these trips before.
But every night, I experience this conflict of indecision in my mind.
It is exhausting to say the least and my Wife is tired of the discussion and I understand that.
Of course, there is also the possibility of staying exactly where we are,  It is a beautiful home, easy to care for, and very economical to live in.
My Wife has a very good plan to provide for my needs as this disease progresses.
We have wonderful health insurance, long term care insurance, and a home that would easily accommodate any medical needs.
When I was in the Navy, I used a mental exercise to deal with the time I was deployed away from my family.
I used to look ahead, project myself mental, to the end of the deployment.
I would think about what we would do, together, when I returned.
I would NOT think about the events of the cruise when I relaxed.
Doing this, relieved the stress of being away and made the separation bearable.
It worked for me, so don't knock it.
However, now, I am trying to do the same thing with my disease.
But the many thoughts that reside in my keep colliding into each other!
So, I will continue to sort this thing out and stop the Internal Conflict.
The problem is, my disease has robbed me of the ability to make decisions.
So, the fight continues.

We just returned from a marvelous trip to Crystal River, Florida.
We went there specifically to swim with the Manatees!
It was a marvelous experience and I applaud the team that took us from "Crystal River Water Sports".
We actually got to see them up close while we snorkeled!
We took our youngest Grandson and he even got to touch a couple of Manatees.
Yes, one handed touches are legal and believe me the tour guide enforced the rules to protect these endangered giants.
I strongly recommend this experience and the company.
My Wife also got to touch the Manatees and she did very well snorkeling and swimming in open water.
She even got bumped into by a playful Manatee!
I had a great time, but I got so exhausted during our first time in the water that I never got back into the water.
Swimming with swim fins, snorkel gear and trying to swim against a mild current completely wore me out!
I got out of the water winded, weak, and out of breath.
Since the air was cool and the water 72 degrees, I would have been warmer getting back into the water,  We were wearing wets suits that were provided by "Crystal River Water Sports".
But I was so exhausted that I thought it was dangerous for me to try to swim again.
I know this is part of my disease and that is why I am reporting this to you.
Any exertion wears me out very quickly!
I have to be careful and look out for this happens.
The last time I over did it was the day I took the Hurricane Curtains off the windows!
I actually had to sit down before I fell down.
This time I stopped the physical exertion before I was totally spent.
I'm learning.
Another thing I noticed, is that I can only drive for an hour or two before I am very tired and need to stop driving.
I used to be able to drive all day and still be alert and safe.
But, now my wife has to fill in as the primary driver.
I should not complain, I can still drive and I know that privilege is soon to be revoked.
This was a great trip and I recommend YOU take advantage of this experience, soon!
I recommend "Crystal River Water Sports" because they are dedicated to your experience while fully protecting the Manatees!
I also recommend it because it is very seldom you get to interact with 12 foot long, one ton, gentile giants.
GOD's creation n is spectacular and we should take every opportunity to experience it.

<doc date=Wednesday, March 20, 2013>
OK, I am reticent to post this because it may be used against me, but here goes.
A couple of days ago, I went from the living room into our bedroom and then the master bath.
I think I was in the closet looking for something, but as I came out of the bathroom, I saw our miniature poodle, Marcel, run past me and under our bed.
That is totally normal, he likes to run under the bed.
He uses that position to make me feel sorry for him if we are going out and he thinks he is not going.
Then I walked back into the living room and I saw Marcel curled up next to my wife on the couch!
I asked her how long he had been there and she said, since before you went into the bedroom.
This is the FIRST time I have had a hallucination where I did not know, that what I was seeing, was not real!
The first time I actually thought, 100%, that what I was looking at was the real thing.
In this case, Marcel!
Now that is frightening to me.
Of course, it means this disease is taking over more of my brain.
It means, I am in control of even less of my cognitive skills.
It means, a lot more than that.
I have written before about my realization that I can no longer live independently.
I used to have this dream of living on some acreage, independent of society, eating what I grow or barter for.
A survivalist or a Rugged Individualist!
I can't even dream that now!
Now, everything is in question.
One other thing.
Last night, we went to be at the same time.
My wife fell asleep before me and I was just drifting off when I heard this snoring.
I came to full awake and asked myself;  Who is snoring that loud?!
It took me a minute to come up with the obvious answer.
Well, at least I did not have to wake her up and ask her name.
That HAS happened before too.
When I was first diagnosed with Dementia, my wife told me;  You are about to live every man's dream.
You will sleep with a different woman every night!
I know that was her way of easing my shock, but it turns out, she probably was right!
And this one snores!
</doc>
<doc date=Saturday, March 16, 2013>
I have written before about my issues during the evening.
For instance, right now my wife has the TV on, LOUD.
I cannot reach the remote and my legs hurt so I don't want to get up to get the remote.
On top of that, my back hurts.
But the LOUD TV is the big issue.
It is making me more and more aggravated and angry.
I would be much more happy if the TV was OFF and it was quiet.
She knows that the noise bothers me, but, I guess she forgets.
Her hearing is failing, but she does not think so.
Also, she is in her active, bounce around and do everything, make noise, and ask questions mode.
It happens most nights, but tonight, it bothers me more.
I will go to bed soon.
To keep peace and to be respectful, I don't say anything.
So, my social filters are working tonight.
But I am steaming inside!
But the good part is, my social filters ARE working!
But, recently, they have not.
I replied to a Facebook post in an inappropriate way.
When I made the reply, I thought what I said was OK, maybe even funny.
Now, I know it was not.
Oh well.
Another issue is driving.
I brushed another car in a parking lot today.
No damage to our car, and some scrapped paint on the other persons bumper cover.
We both called our insurance companies and my company said it was "No Fault".
No big issue but it illuminates the fact that soon, I won't be driving.
This is the second parking lot issue I have had, both backing out of a parking space.
I actually fell things are coming apart at the seams.
I know what the reality of my disease is.
But, in my mind, I am still the same as I was before I was diagnosed.
But, deep down, I know that is a lie.
Those two emotions continuously fight in my mind.
Another issue is, I still have this need to be in a facility that provides for me.
Again, I know I don't need that yet.
But, I still feel the need to be cared for.
One other emotion.
Florida!
We moved here to be close to our Son and his family.
That part has been exceptional.
I am closer to my Son that ever before and I know my wife enjoys the connection with family.
The problem is, I miss my friends from Tidewater.
We have a very nice guest room, that has been used twice.
Our best friends, Jerry and Marcia and my Sister.
I know other people have their own lives, work, have responsibilities.
and their own friends besides me.
But, I live in Florida, not Alaska!
So, as you can see, I am having a bad night and I am going to bed now.
This blog's purpose is to keep everyone informed as to how this disease is effecting me.
Well tonight, it is kicking my but.
Good night.
PS.
As I was going to sleep last night, I thought about my day and why my day as so bad.
Here is a review.
As I woke up, the day's entire plan was changed.
I had a small auto accident,  during a nap, I had a bowel accident, and while I was cleaning up, I found something new and unfamiliar growing in a place I don't want to mention.
I hope today will be better.

A few weeks or so ago, my neurologist told me that he thought the Parkinson's part of my LBD would become an issue by the end of the year.
It appears he was right.
Now this rare prediction by a neurologist is a first in my journey.
Just the same, he was right, so I will give him his due.
The pain portion of this disease seems to have settled in my legs for the most part.
The leg pain seems more intense in the evening than any other time.
Since I was placed on the Exelon Patch, the only over the counter pain reliever I can take is Tylenol and it's derivatives, and they do not work for me.
So, I just endure the pain for now.
The involuntary     movements effect my large muscle areas.
Legs and arms seem to be the most effected.
Today, I almost kicked a hole in the back door as my leg jerked out of control.
The movement is annoying right now.
I can see where it may become a real problem.
It bears monitoring.
My instability has increased to the point that I used my cane whenever I am out of the house.
I am getting used to having my cane with me, so that is a good thing.
I have a good walker with a seat and a storage compartment under the seat.
It is red and sporty.
I do use my walker for longer outings like the historic walking tours of Pensacola.
I get many jealous looks during the tour when I sit down while everyone else stands!
My memory is noticeably decreasing.
But my psyche in dealing with this change is interesting.
I no longer try to hide my memory issues.
I have decided not to fight this disease but to learn to live with it.
Fighting it is tiring and fruitless.
So, I have given myself permission to let this journey progress without resistance.
Don't fret about my decision not to fight.
Fighting actually detracts from my ability to enjoy life.
I want to enjoy my life and journey.
If I spill my meal on my shirt, so what!
If I don't remember your name, tell me again who you are.
If I need to sleep all afternoon, I will.
The bottom line is, this disease will progress at it's own rate, and I cannot effect that.
So, I might as well accept that and enjoy what I can.
So, that's where we stand.
I read a lot about Lewy Body Dementia.
I see the issues my fellow LBD sufferers live with.
Those folks are my support group as well as you.
It helps me to know that I am not the only person with some of these issues.
Like I have said before, I am normal!
It is a good feeling.

I had a great relationship with my Dad.
I loved him and really enjoyed spending time with him.
As I became an adult and joined the Navy, my Dad enjoyed visiting me and experiencing the Navy through my career.
He was in great physical shape and bowled, shot pool, and drove until he passed away at almost 90.
He bowled in three leagues up to the end and was angry if he did not have a 600 series!
I also remember that the young men in the pool hall would NOT play my Dad for money.
Why, because he beat them more often that not and took their money!!
But there was one thing I did not understand, he did not like to schedule a trip.
He used to say that scheduling the trip made the actual trip anti-climatic!
He would rather get up in the morning and get in the car and GO!
I really did not understand that until now.
Now, I do not like anything scheduled.
I don't like the alarm to be set, an appointed place to be, or to be expected to be anywhere.
Scheduled events cause me to stress and they overload me.
I get tired and overwhelmed when events begin to run together.
Sometimes, I am tired and  I need to sleep.
If I have a scheduled event, I cannot take that nap or sleep in.
And dealing with LBD, I need the freedom to sleep or just relax when I need or want to.
Of course, I still get aggravated over people judging my medical condition when they are not qualified.
And since being involved in organizations puts me in contact with people who feel the need to pass judgement on me, I have decided not to associate with people in anything but a casual environment that I control.
No one is going to put a requirement on me anymore.
So, a almost 62, I have learned again, just how smart my Dad really was!
It's never too late to learn.

<doc date=Thursday, March 7, 2013>
I have found the answer to my sweating, body temperature rises, and other bodily function issues.
It is a primary symptom of the progress of LBD.
My neurologist has not mentioned it.
I guess he is waiting for me to tell hime so he can say; "I was expecting that."
It took me some research to find this info, but I have found it on three respected web sites.
These problems worried me.
For instance, I get exhausted and perspire profusely when I exert the least amount of effort.
I also get very winded.
I was playing Ping Pong yesterday with a new friend who has Parkinson's.
I was real sweating and breathing hard.
He asked me if I had a heart condition?
I told him no, but this further supports my theory.
I also found out that Lewy Body Dementia was only discovered in 1996!
Now, it existed before 1996, but it was diagnosed as Parkinson's with Dementia (PDD).
In 1996, the Lewy Bodies in the brain that cause this disease were discovered.
So, it was called Lewy Body Dementia.
The medical profession is struggling to learn about this disease.
When I moved to Florida, I went to a GP physician who was recommended to me.
He told me that he had not heard of LBD and would have to do some research on it.
He has, and I am happy with him.
Those of us with this disease suffer from the ignorance of others.
We get told we are not sick, we are fakers, malingerers, or gold bricks.
I am a man of honor and I don't lie.
I am sick, and I am suffering, and I am tired of having to prove it to everyone.
I am sure my fellow LBD sufferers are too.
I read a post on the Lewy Body Dementia Association Web Site where a nursing home nurse told a LBD sufferer that she DID NOT have LBD and was faking because she had lived too long!
If the statistics only started to be accumulated in 1996, just how good are the statistics?!
But, we with this "New" disease are always called into question as liars.
As far as my disease is concerned, I am moving down that highway that I have to travel.
I am farther along that I was a week ago, but I have miles to go before I sleep.
As measured by my neurologist, my memory is much worse.
My brain has slowed by 50%, his calculation not mine.
The pain I experience in my major muscles like legs, arms, and shoulders, is increasing.
I choke when I eat, sweat uncontrollably, have difficult getting out of a chair, have problems reading and speaking, get disoriented, angry, constipated, and tired.
The most frustrating part of this "New" disease is that no one can tell me what is happening to me.
So, I have discovered what autonomic processes are and mine are broke!
Good discovery!
Hope it helps someone else know and understand what is happening to them.

I had a scheduled visit with my Psychiatrist today.
He specializes in folks with dementia and is particularly specialized in Lewy Body Dementia.
He helps me manage the effects of my many drugs.
Today, we talked about my recent revelation that I could not live alone anymore.
I told him that this had upset me.
His reply was, you guessed it; " That's normal and I was expecting it!"
What's with these neurologists and psychiatrists, the never tell you what is going to happen, just what they expected after YOU have the issue!!
Just the same, it was reassuring that I was normal.
He said my being upset over this new found, for me, fact showed that I am still cognizant of my humanity.
OK, I guess I can see that.
He then told me that I could never live alone again!
His closing question was, how old are you?
I said after some thought, 61.
He said, you are still OK.
I guess as long as I know how old I am, my mind is not that far gone.
But, it did take a minute for me to figure it out.
We also discussed my hallucinations and my confusion in the dark when we go to bed.
Again, he said as long as I know where the bathroom is, I am OK..
I guess that is a major issue.
It would be bad if I got up and urinated on the Big Screen TV!
You have to find humor in this.
I see things that are not there, I am disoriented in my own bedroom, and I cannot manage the basics of life so I can't live alone.
But, I know my age so I am OK.
This is a great disease!
But if I extrapolate that premise, when I am peeing on the Big Screen, frightened by my hallucinations, and drooling on my shirt, I probably won't know what my age is.
Good!
I got it.
Maybe I should open an office to help LBD sufferers navigate this disease.
Probably not, I would forget where the office is.
Smile!

My neurologist has placed me on the Exelon patch in conjunction with Razadyne and Namenda.
I have read on the Internet that the addition of Exelon actually attacks the effects of dementia in another part of the brain.
I have been on this regimen for about six weeks and I have seen no difference in my memory.
I will continue it because I see no adverse effects.
Now, if I end up with one leg shorter than the other ten years from now, I will know there was an issue.
I now take so many drugs that I get thank you notes from my pharmacist and I was invited to the CVS regional Christmas party last year as the Guest of Honor.
I am sure I am doing more damage to my liver than all the excess alcohol drinking I did earlier in m life.
But, if it extends my ability to operate independently, it will be worth it.
The real point of this post is how I am dealing with the eventual effects of LBD.
My wife told me tonight, for the first time, hat she know I have slipped a cog recently.
That is how we describe my incremental decline.
One cog or one step at a time.
We watched that step by step decline in her Father as he suffered through Alzheimer's.
When he was dealing with his journey, there were no drugs to slow the decline and there was little knowledge about the disease.
He died in 1991.
Now, I am facing the same end of life issues.
Or, better said, my Wife and family are facing the same end of life issues.
Yes, we benefit from medical science and new drugs, but the end product is the same.
I have been having difficulty dealing with this.
First, I realize that I cannot live independently because I cannot manage my meds.
Yes, my wife has done my drugs for a while, but the Exelon patch was the last straw.
But that is just one issue.
My memory has declined and now I don't even remember big issues that bother me unless I am reminded.
I actually have to read my own blog to recall problems or emotions!
We were getting ready for a doctor's appointment tomorrow.
My Wife asked me to give her some of the issues I am dealing with and I did not recall any of them.
These issues coupled with my recent urgent desire to cocoon into a small, all caring, environment with my wife, further illustrate the concern and mental anguish I am facing.
But, the good part is I know I am not facing this alone.
Just the same, I am having problems dealing with this.
I don't think there are any new drugs to deal with this issue.

I have noticed that every time I eat a meal, I break into the sweats.
My head beads up, sweat runs down my neck, and my entire body is hot.
It lasts for about 30 minutes and then my body temperature returns to normal.
It is annoying, not debilitating.
Have any of you or your spouses experienced this issue or a variation of it?
I have not been able to find this symptom on the Web or even on the Lewy Body Dementia Association's web site.
I wonder if this is related to my LBD or just a product of aging.
Thanks for your help.

We took a nap this afternoon.
That's not new.
But, as I was going to sleep, a thought came into my mind that upset me greatly!
For the first time I realized that I no longer can live independently.
I cannot manage my prescriptions and there is one drug I cannot even administer!
That fact escaped me until now.
I have always took pride in my independence.
And I knew someday, I would loose my driving privileges and that would be difficult.
But this is a much worse blow to my psych.
I have written before about a statement my neurologist made back in Virginia Beach.
She said I had not yet dealt with the impact of my disease.
She was right then, but I thought I had finally dealt with my LBD until now.
But another lead boot has hit the floor!
We spent yesterday looking at a Continuing Care Facility that had independent living, assisted Living and Memory support capabilities.
The facility knew of my diagnosis and still wanted to have me as a resident.
That alone is rare.
Numerous facilities in the Continuing Care discipline reject people diagnosed with dementia.
But, we decided not to move to that facility and to instead, continue to live in our home.
I have often told folks that show sympathy to me about my disease that LBD is a better disease to get than some others.
Why, because I forget what bothers me.
Now, I am not so sure that is correct.

<doc date=Friday, February 22, 2013>
I just noticed that I have not posted for a week!
I really cannot tell you where this week has gone or what I did.
I do remember that a friend of mine passed away.
He was a Brother in Christ and a Navy Shipmate.
His wife passed away a few years ago and now he has joined her.
Those events always make me think and reflect on the past.
We also continue to try to find the path to our future.
Where we will live and what that will look like.
Linda and I have an appointment to look at a retirement facility in nearby Mobile, Alabama on Monday.
It is an expedition into the unknown but we are looking forward too it.
The facility we are looking at is a continuing care facility with facilities for assisted living and memory care.
Yes, I am on the list for admission into the Armed Forces Retirement Home, and that may well be where I end up, but I must explore every possibility.
I owe that to Linda and myself.
My progress seems to be the same.
The neurologist was right, I am experiencing more of the Parkinson issues of Lewy Body Dementia.
Up until now, I have had some issues but they have been mostly manageable.
Since I have a relatively high threshold of pain.
So the muscle pains up to now had been tolerable.
But now the pain, especially in the evening, is becoming more difficult to deal with.
Because of the prescription meds I take for my memory, I cannot take aspirin, ibuprofen, or any other NSAID.
So, right now, if the Sinemet does not work or works slow, I hurt.
Also, balance issues are beginning to get more pronounced.
I really need to use my cane all the time.
But, I either forget it or my pride gets in the way of my better judgement.
I guess I will wait until I fall and hurt myself before I use my cane all the time.
Other Blogs on Lewy Body Dementia record the struggles of my fellow sufferers.
Many of them have had Parkinson issues since the beginning.
I was fortunately spared that suffering until now so I won't complain.
Honest.
One other point.
I have a Pastor friend who was recently diagnosed with Alzheimer's Disease.
He showed some of the symptoms earlier but we chalked it up to ageing.
You know the symptoms, confusion, short term memory issues, trouble reading.
He is now having difficulties and I emphasize for him and his wife.
And dementia is a difficult disease to deal with for the sufferer and the spouse.
But this friend, a life long Pastor, still fulfills all the duties that he can in His Church and family.
It hurts me to see him suffer.
And maybe, since I walk dow a similar path as him, I feel just as connected to his suffering as his family does.
So, I ask all of you to visit someone that you know who is suffering with a memory issue and just be there for them.
It really helps.
I know.

My last two posts were pretty angry.
That's because I was pretty angry!
But, yesterday we had our middle Grandson with us and it was wonderful.
We had dinner together, we made home made hamburgers on the grill!
My Grandson and I cooked the burgers and as I got the grill ready I noticed that a family of small Florida frogs had set up housekeeping in the covered compartment under my grill where the gas bottle sets.
As I opened the door, two small frogs jumped out and then quickly jumped back in!
It was wonderful to see.
GOD makes a way for His creation to survive and excel.
Here it is February and I am watching frogs.
Now, I will be honest, in June, the frogs are so loud at night you can't sleep, even with the AC on!
But still, seeing the frogs, the dogwoods blooming, the sun, the frequent rain storms, all tell me that GOD is in charge!
That one thought will keep me going.

This is a continuation of my last posting because I am steaming right now.
Many people have questioned my illness.
I guess if I was drooling on my shirt and peeing in my pants, they might begin to believe in my diagnosis.
By the way, I do both of these sometimes!
But I take these unfounded criticisms quietly.
but no more!
I have decided that being nice to doctors, strangers, and people in general, is not worth the frustration I experience.
So, either keep your mouth shut about my disease or be prepared for a class "A" ass chewing from this old retired Master Chief Gunner's Mate!
I am fed up with uninformed peoples attitudes and comments about how I look or what they think isn't wrong with me.
These people should be happy I don't comment on what I think is wrong with them.
For instance, old women, who look old, sagging, and fat, with their died hair and fancy make up and nails.
Oh, and their pedicures on those fat, smelly, feet.
How self centered.
It is like putting lipstick on a pig!
You are old, lady!
You look like a clown!
Or men, old men, with long lair!
Grow up and get a haircut old man!
Or young people who all look alike and talk alike in a attempt to show their individuality.
Really?!
Do something original, like clean your too, help your parents, and get good grades!
I am sick of people, sick of their attitudes and judgements without facts, and sick of putting up with your bullshit.
Leave me alone and I will do the same.
Step on my toes and I will break your nose!
Enough said.

My neurologist, GP, and my wife all agree that exercise is good for me.
I also agree but I normally don't want to exercise anymore.
There was a time that exercise was an important part of my daily routine.
Back when I thought there was a chance I would be recalled to active duty.
Now, I know there is no hope of that.
Just the same, exercise has been reinserted into my routine.
My wife loves to walk and walking is her preferred exercise.
She has enlisted me into her fitness brigade and I must admit I love it.
We have established a 3.5 mile course, through neighborhoods that are close to us.
Our goal is to complete this course in one hour!
Since I have been having pain issues with my legs related to my LBD I wondered what effect walking for 3.5 miles would have.
Well, I can report there is no impact on my leg muscles, positive or negative.
I do notice that I feel better in general.
I have more energy and I seem to be sleeping better.
So, walking is good.
There is an even better impact of walking with your wife.
Together time!
We talk about everything with nothing to interrupt us.
No phone, no telephone, no one knocking at the door, no email, nothing but us.
So walking has many positive results that I am glad to experience.

I have received the final decision from the Veteran's Administration telling me they are denying my claim that my Lewy Body Dementia, (formally called Parkinson's with dementia) was not caused by my contact with the chemicals in the hydraulic fluid used in gun mounts and missile launchers through out my 20+ year Navy career.
Not to mention that the VA agrees that the chemical in Mil-F-17111 is carcinogenic and neurotoxic and that I was exposed to this chemical.
Seems wrong doesn't it.
So, you might say, contact your Congressman.
Good idea and I did.
When we lived in Virginia, I contacted and provided Congressman Ridgell's staff all the information they required to help with my claim.
To their credit, they tried and failed.
When I moved to Florida, I contacted Congressman Miller's staff.
I provided them the information they asked for and they treated me with disdain and did nothing for me.
So, I can pretty much say that my Congressman is not interested in helping me.
If I were an illegal alien, a welfare mother with a passel of illegitimate kids, a union member, or some other miscreant that did nothing to serve this country, I would have a free smart phone, free food, paid for housing, free medical, and a free pass when  mess up.
But, I am one of the many who worked for what I have, donated to those who needed help, served in the Military when we were making less than $120 per month, and lived within my means!
I am injured, terminally, by my service to the country, and I a thrown aside because some bureaucrat in the VA does not think my disease was caused by a chemical they have agreed causes my disease!
So, you can see where I might be just a little upset.
And I am!
And yes, I could get an attorney and take them to court.
But I cannot afford that!
I have financial responsibilities to my family and my wife after I succumb to my disease.
So, I have decided to never mention this topic again.
I have put the VA behind me just as they have cast me aside.
I have other things to do at this moment.

<doc date=Friday, February 1, 2013>
There are things that happen in my mind and in my life, that are different, shocking, even frightening, that I work through, deal with, and dismiss.
That means I don't tell my wife or anyone else.
Why, because I am afraid to reveal the progress of my disease and maybe because I hope the event is just a one time event.
It's true.
The first time something happens, it is interesting and it may be an anomaly.
If it happens a second time and a third time, it is probably, most likely, a new indicator my LBD is progressing.
For instance, when we turn off the lights to go to bed, our room is dark.
Pitch black dark!
And that darkness disorients me in various ways.
I run through a checklist at this time every night.
Where is the door to the bathroom, where is the exit door, where am I?
Lately, I have had some difficulty answering these questions!
It is a new problem and I have discussed it with my wife.
Management of our email is another issue.
I normally read the email and let my wife know if she has any action items.
A few days ago, I lost control of this process.
Seems hard to understand but I was afraid to tell he about some emails she had action due on.
It came to a head and I confessed my fright.
It was difficult to do and I was somewhat embarrassed, but, it was good to get out in the open.
But it was good.
Why is there reticence to bring these things out in the open?
I believe it is difficult for me to admit that I am having difficulties dealing with my disease.
A new neurologist in the practice back in Virginia Beach told me I had not yet dealt with my disease.
I now admit that she is right!
But I am trying.

I used to have a fairly explosive temper.
It's true and you will say Amen if you know me.
But more and more, I find myself holding in my emotions, trying not to say negative things, and not permitting myself to be overwhelmed by my perspective on life.
Why, because loosing one's temper is a big problem for those of us with LBD.
As I read about my disease, loosing my temper is considered is a big, negative milestone and I don't want to go past that point until I have too!
So, I find myself not expressing my emotions and swallowing my tongue instead of blowing up as I used too.
But, this causes me to overload my emotional limit stops from time to time!
I causes the feeling of pressure in my head and the associated headaches and pounding in my ears.
But, I guard myself from loosing my temper and being labeled as a person out of control.
But, on the other hand, while controlling my emotions has became harder, I realize someday I will not be able to control my emotions at all.
So, as I watch this disease marches on, I guard against the future issues as long as I can.
Of course, we all realize I will soon not know that I am emotionally exploding.
But for now, I am calm, cool, and collected, at least on the outside.
I guess that is called a facade.
On another issue.
As the neurologist told us, the Parkinson's issues are increasing.
My legs hurt most of the time.
The push and pull muscles are constantly fighting with each other and that hurts.
In the evening, my legs hurt enough that it is very difficult for me to get off the couch.
We are considering purchasing a life chair for me.
Most of the time, I really need help getting up from the couch.
We have not started the Sinemet because he wanted me to spend a week on the Exelon patch to make sure I did not get nausea or any other side effects from that new drug.
So Monday, we start the Sinemet.
We will see.
I will keep you posted.

<doc date=Wednesday, January 23, 2013>
Today, I had an appointment with my neurologist to discuss the recent tests he had done.
First the Cognitive Skills Test.
I went down is a couple of new areas.
As he said, my memory is shot.
I knew that.
The tests of the nerves and muscles in my legs was all normal.
So, he agrees the pain in my legs is from the Parkinson's portion of the Lewy Body Dementia.
I knew that too.
He told us the Parkinson's was now coming on quickly.
I really don't know how he knows that, but it is what he said.
One interesting test in the Cognitive Skills test is one where you tap the space bar on a computer as fast as you can for one minute.
You accomplish this test with both hands.
My scores have dropped 50% from last year.
He said this proves my mind is slowing down.
OK, I knew that too.
However, I was not prepared to deal with the Parkinson's portion of this LBD challenge right now.
As a matter of fact, I really did not want to deal with that part.
But, it seems will have too.
I have difficulty getting off the couch and my legs hurt almost constantly from the muscle pain.
I am getting more unsteady on my feet and I have difficulty starting to walk after I sit for a while, like in the car.
So, he may be right.
He wants to put me on Sinemet and I agreed as long as I tolerate it.
Again, we will see.
He also prescribed an Excelon patch to use in addition to my Razadyne and Namenda pills.
He hopes this may help my memory.
We will see.
So, this was a good visit and I felt he was actually engaged with us in the conversation.
I will see how the new meds do and I will keep trying to be positive.
At least the tests bear out what I am feeling.
That makes me feel vindicated.
For a change, during this appointment, I did not feel like I was being called a liar or a malingerer.
He really treated me like I was dealing with health issues.
More later, I need a nap.

I had the flu of something that quickly turned into bronchitis.
It took me over three weeks to shake it and I am still coughing.
I was coughing so badly during the height of the illness that I would actually pass out!!
I have had that problem before but not to the level it effected me this time.
But the real issue is that I just did not have the strength to bounce back this time.
I am still weak and I get tired quickly doing just about anything.
I know this is directly related to the effects of the LBD, but t has impacted my mental health.
I now question my resilience.
Just a few years ago, I considered myself indestructible.
I could work through being sick and did, many times.
In my mind, I had a store of energy, strength, and fortitude, that enabled me to "Gut" my way through anything.
I was talking to an old shipmate, who just passed away 21 December.
We reminisced about the time, in Bremerton Washington, that I had too much to drink and a Second Class Cook and I got into an auto crash, he was driving.
We hit a telephone pole and I went through the windshield.
Chief Mowery made me work the next day!!
No sympathy.
But, I did not want any, I was tough.
Now, not so much.
I just want to sleep or sit and watch TV.
I have little or no desire to do anything.
Thanks to my wife, I get out, but not of my own choosing.
So, I see the effects of LBD on my mind, body, and psyche.
All negative.
Am I upset about it.
No, not really.
But I am past thinking this is "interesting" as I used too.
Now, I just find it annoying.

I read an article about the autopsy of Junior Seau's brain following his recent suicide.
The autopsy showed that he had the same tangles as a person with Alzheimer's Disease.
He was a young man who had physically abused his body ever since he was a youngster.
Football is a violent sport.
Full size me, crashing into each other at high speed, time and time again.
GOD did not design and build our bodies for that sort of damage.
Just the same, he was a young man with old persons issues.
But the question that may be on some peoples minds is;  Why did Junior Seau commit suicide?
I think I have some insight into that issue.
Here is this young, strong, independent, man.
A sports hero to young and old alike.
His Mother's favorite child, her provider.
Here is this man who accomplished so much in such a short period of time, realizing that his mind is not functioning as it once did.
He quickly lost the ability to recall simple daily issues and data.
It may have started with his computer passwords or football statistics of Plays he once knew by heart.
Maybe he forgot where he lived for a brief moment!
In any case, he was for the first time in his life, frightened.
He was faced with an opponent that he knew he could not overcome!
And that fear and frustration won out and he took the only way out he thought would permit him to escape his future fate quickly and before he made a fool of himself.
Dementia, by any name, reduces us to much less than we once were.
Mentally, physically, socially.
Those of us who have to face this degradation first hand, deal with that reality in our own ways.
What we go through is different than what our loved ones and care givers go through.
We don't fully understand their pain and I now they don't understand ours.
Now don't worry, I have no intentions of committing suicide.
It is not my style.
And I still find the progression of this disease somewhat interesting, as strange as that may seem to some of you.
But, I do understand Mr. Seau's decision.
He was in mental anguish, pain, with no way to deal with it.
So, he quit before he was fired!
Another thought.
Those of us who have Dementia dread the thought of our loved ones having to deal with the effects of our disease.
I am still OK with my LBD, but I hate the fact that my wife has to go through this.
She does not have that issue.
She is ready, willing, and able, to care for me, regardless of what happens.
I just hate the fact that she base to.
But, that's what "I sickness and Health" meant!
I am blessed!

No, not in my house suspended from balloons, but UP as in not asleep.
I was sitting here reminiscing about my mentor and old friend Bill Mowery.
I found out yesterday that he passed away, alone, on December 20th.
That hit me hard for many reasons.
Since we moved to Florida, I always meant to go see him, he was only 4 or 5 hours drive away, but I never did.
He died alone, and I was not there for him.
But what really has me concerned is that I am having problems remembering the names of shipmates!
I remember the ship's names, but few shipmate's names come to mind anymore and that bothers me!
There are a few who keep in touch with me, and my closest friend, Jerry Hart, but names and faces have faded from memory.
Some times, a name pops into my memory and then fades away as quick.
I don't know where they are or even if they are alive.
bUt for that fleeting moment, they come into memory and then disappear.
This disease is cruel sometimes.

You know how much I love neurologists!
And I am sure you know how much I appreciate them questioning my Dx, which was from another Neurologist and confirmed by a research hospital neurologist!
Well, my neurologist in Florida had order more off the wall tests than anyone before him.
Today, I had a nerve test done in my legs to see if they work good.
The Technician asked me if I knew why my neurologist wanted these tests.
My reply was; "He needs one more test to get a set of steak knives!"
That must be the reason.
I am not diabetic, by instability comes from the muscles fighting each other in my legs.
It is a classic LBD symptom.
You know, LBD equals Parkinson's and Alzheimer's combined.
Hey Doc, read the pamphlet!!
We have decided we will no longer use a neurologist.
Just my GP.
He can prescribe what I am taking and since there is nothing new to be done, I can save Blue Cross a ton of money by cutting out the middle man!
I am sick of medical tests.
I know I said that before, because I looked back in the posts.
I ave to remember, no more tests!
I think he takes advantage of my poor memory and orders more tests.
At least, that's how I remember it.

This has been a very eventful year!
But you already know that.
It has also been a very emotional year for you and me.
You have seen me meltdown on this blog over the outcome of the Presidential election and have read about how LBD has effected me.
You also know that we moved to Florida at the end of 2011.
That transition has been difficult for me and the year of 2012 has had it's ups and downs as a result of that move.
Today is Christmas day.
My Pastor called me and I really enjoyed that call.
Pastor Fred is a mentor and friend to me.
He took me from an AWANA leader and Sunday School teacher to a Pulpit Preaching Pastor.
I miss Fred, my Church family at Grace Community Church in Virginia Beach, and that entire part of my life.
Yes, leaving my Navy family has been hard and they are not replaceable.
But, I miss my Church and all of the wonderful people there even more.
And, as I have found out, they are not replaceable either!
Florida has been good for me in many ways.
I truly needed to build an adult relationship with my son.
He moved to New York state not long after he was married and we just never had the time together to build that relationship.
Him and I being together, without kids or wives, is special.
We can discuss "Man" issues and help each other through the problems of daily life.
That can't be done  600 miles away or during a few visits a year.
James and I have re bonded and now have a much stronger relationship.
I have also been able to reconnect with two of my Grandsons.
They are in the middle teen years and, in both cases,  Linda and I are having a real influence in their lives.
This time is precious for them and for us.
I would not give this time with my family up for all the money in the world.
It is a precious gift from GOD.
But I still long for the times, back in Virginia Beach, with my Church family and my shipmates.
Definitely, there is a hole in my soul that will never be filled because we are no longer together.
I never thought I would leave Virginia.
GOD does work in mysterious ways.
HE also works for our good.
I will never forget that!
Merry Christmas.

For a long time, I had been unable to cry.
I don't know why, but crying just would not happen.
Recently, I have found myself crying about things that surprise me.
Yesterday, I looked at a Christmas ornament that has been with me since I was a very little boy.
It is a little elf that was a package decoration.
Every year, it was on one of my presents.
Then, it became a traditional tree decoration.
My Mother gave it to me when Linda and I were married and we have placed it on our Christmas tree for the last 39 years!
Yesterday, I was looking at the tree and burst into tears!
I looked at the elf and realized he was the model for the "Elf Story" that is popular with small children today.
For some reason, that little elf brought forth a flood of emotions, missing my Mother, My Mom and Dad, remembering my youth, friends, the hurts, and the happiness.
I was also overwhelmed with the deepening feeling of my own demise.
Now that topic has never been a topic of thought for me.
Even as a Navy Gunner's Mate, as dangerous as that profession was, did I ever think of death.
Lately however, the thought of death seeps into my mind.
As I have said before, my neurologist in Virginia Beach told me I had not yet come to terms with this disease.
That was over a year ago and now I am beginning to address the outcome of LBD.
I guess I am a slow starter!
Now don't get me wrong, it actually feels good to cry.
To be able to release the emotions that build up is a relief, not a problem.
So, I am glad this has come to me.
I am also beginning to look at life from a different prospective.
I always knew that I would die, someday.
Everyone know that.
But, in my mind, that day was an eternity away!
Now, I know that it is not.
I am beginning to enjoy life more.
For instance, Christmas!
I always dreaded Christmas.
I had some very difficult memories of Christmas from my youth and the entire hustle and bustle of Christmas was just overwhelming to me.
I resisted putting up the Christmas tree and really resisted putting up out door lights.
Now, I want the tree up as early as possible and I have my front yard as a witness to the birth of Christ with a very large, lighted, Manger scene.
I have lights along the roof of the house and I have plans for even more lights and a camel and donkey in the front yard for next year!!
So, crying is a positive thing for me and I believe I am beginning to realistically deal with Lewy Body Dementia.
More to come.

<doc date=Wednesday, December 12, 2012>
Since we moved to Florida, one of the frustrations has been establishing a relationship with a new group of doctors.
The Family Practitioner is wonderful.
Not as good as my Family Doctor, Bob Dowdy, in Virginia Beach, but a good substitute.
But getting used to my Neurologist is a real challenge.
By definition, Neurologists have the bedside manner of a rattlesnake!
They are full of themselves, self absorbed, and self-proclaimed Know-it-alls.
Every time I have to go to a new Neurologist, I spend the first year of appointments trying to convince this doctor that the other doctors were correct and I DO have LBD!!
Each self-absorbed doctor thinks everyone else is wrong and only they can properly diagnose any neurological disease.
And each time, the new neurologist comes to the same conclusion, at my expense.
Even the neurologists at UVA who were tasked to provide a second opinion by my Neurologist in Virginia Beach.
Actually, that one event may have been the most trying for me.
This Neurologist is the same as all the rest.
He treats me as if I am malingering or lying!
As my wife and I describe problems and issues that have occurred since my last visit, he tries to tell me they are not related to my disease and trivializes my problems!
Truthfully, I am fed up with the drill and I am tempted to tell him and his profession to take a long walk off a short pier!
However, my wife has convinced me to hang in there a little while longer.
But one more curt answer and he is out of here!
</doc>
<doc date=Tuesday, December 11, 2012>
I know I have addressed this problem before, but I believe it is getting more pronounced.
Any situation that is based in or has an escalation to a confrontation causes me to become upset and also causes my "Fight or Flight" responses to surface.
Normally, I just want to get away from or peaceably stop the situation and return to calm, normal conversational topics.
I have had a couple of angry outbursts in the car when someone does something that I feel threatens us.
I realize this is a normal emotion in everyone but it is amplified in me and happens earlier in situations that ever before.
Additionally, I react the same way with the discussion of our finances, even though our finances are demonstrably fine.
The normal discussion of our financial goals and condition causes me to recoil and immediately change the topic.
That or I just quickly agree with my wife and change the topic.
Now, I used to do all the long range finances and savings plans.
Now, I want nothing to do with the topic.
This change causes a challenge for my wife.
It causes her to either shield me from controversy or watch me react to it.
She has to walk on egg shells because of me and that is not fair.
But, she knows I am not at fault, it is the LBD.
The interesting part is, right now, when I am doing well, and there are no issues at the fore front, I can write about this issue and describe my emotions.
But, when I am negatively impacted by the events or topic of the discussion, I just react, without reason or thought.
This truly is an interesting, unpredictable, maddening, disease.
Of course, I know soon, I will not have the good times as much.
So, it is good to describe these reactions now for all to learn.
Thanks for listening.

I wonder where I would be, how much further down the road of memory loss, if my Neurologist in Virginia, Dr. Mary Bowles, had not been so aggressive in my diagnosis and treatment.
She got me on Arecept and Namenda much earlier than other doctors would have. 
</doc>
<doc date=Wednesday, November 28, 2012>
Today, we went and watched the movie, "The Life of Pi".
Now I have been told by a number of people, including my neurologist in Norfolk, that I had not yet dealt with my disease.
My view was, baloney.
Well, I learned tonight that they were right!
Watching the "Life of Pi" I broke down and cried!
Now, I have not cried in years, but tonight I fell apart.
Now, I need to look at why I broke down.
This is a really tough issue for me and it goes back to the circumstances of my birth and everything after that.
I have a lot to face and I will need help.
But, at least I am starting to deal with the reality of my condition.

<doc date=Monday, November 26, 2012>
My friends, after three weeks I have decided to leave my self imposed prison and begin to communicate to you, my LBD family.
The results of the election were more than I could handle and I could not find a way to express my anger and disgust.
I now accept the fact that the GOD of the universe is in charge and HIS will IS being done!
It truly does not matter what I want or think!
HIS will is going to be done.
That being said, I will try to put the pieces of what's left of my emotions back together.
LBD updates;  I find it more and more difficult to deal with controversy and disagreement.
I cannot express myself effectively and my "Fight or Flight" emotion takes over.
To date, I can control that emotion.
I fear that someday I will not be able to.
I remember my "easy going" Father in Law getting into a fist fight at the nursing home once or twice when he had Alzheimer's.
I was very surprised then, but no so now.
I also have difficulties dealing with commitments on my time.
While I want to be involved in organizations I recoil at any demand on my time through scheduled, meaningless, social, meetings.
My view is, if we have something to do, let's do it.
If not, leave me alone.
On second thought, just leave me alone anyway.
I enjoy time with my wife and family without encumbrances from any outside group.
I guess I am becoming a recluse.
Any confrontation is too much for me.
Recently we had issues with out cable company.
I called them, probably not the best idea,  and they told me tough luck.
My view was, OK, I quit!
We have changed out service for Internet, cable, and telephone, to a different company at a lower rate with better service.
But I hope they don't forget customer service because they are the only other choice!
Again, that "Fight or Flight" issue.
Interesting!
Another issue is making decisions.
I can't seem to make a decision on anything.
My wife knows how to deal this issue.
She suggests one or two things like meals out, places to go, or activities, and then directs me to a solution.
I know she does this and I am fine with it.
If I have to make the choice, we will never go any where or eat any thing.
My body does not work like it used too.
I have become accustomed to my alternating bouts of constipation and diarrhea.
I also understand my issues with aspirating when I eat.
Now, I have to dal with biting my lip when I eat!
My left, lower, lip just began getting between my teeth when I eat or even chew gum!
Ouch!
I am sure this is something the neurologic tells me he was expecting, just like punching my wife in my sleep.
I a sure there is more exciting issues to come.
My wife drives more and I use my cane more.
She should probably drive all the time and I should use my cane all the time.
But I go at this in stages.
I still try to be the master of this relentless disease.
I refuse to give up without a fight!
Well, it is good to be back in communications with all of you.
There will be more to follow.

<doc date=Wednesday, November 7, 2012>
If you are a regular reader of mine, you will have been through my recent posts about my extreme disappointment over the election.
I am a patriot and I am a Constitutionalist.
I took and administered the Oath that Enlisted personnel take to join or re-enlist in the Navy and all the Military Branches.
That Oath says: "I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States, against all enemies, foreign and domestic.
And I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same."
I take that Oath very seriously and when I see our nation taking a path that is against that Oath, I get emotional.
Obviously!
But the shocking fact is that my wife and I have seen how the LBD has impacted my ability to deal with disappointment.
I am still very shook, very confused about my feelings and very angry.
And, except for my wife, my son, and my best friend Jerry,  no one has tried to contact me, help me deal with this shock, or even reacted to my posts!
That makes me realize that I am very much alone, with the exception of the afore mentioned loved ones, in my journey.
I am a burden to those who now regret knowing me.
People with long term, terminal, diseases are looked upon by the "Healthy Normal, community" as a burden to be suffered, occasionally.
No!!
How many times did you visit your Grandparents in the nursing home or hospital?
How about your elderly parents?
A friend who is sufferinf from a long term illness?
I thought so!
So, when I express my shock and horror about the election results, everyone, except the afore mentioned loved ones, ignored me.
It's almost like you are saying; "Please stop taking your meds!"
or; "I agree with your decision to stop taking your meds!"
Maybe not, but that is how I see it.
But it is OK, I am doing better thanks to my wife, son, and Jerry.
I am still not 100%, but I am better.
So, stop worrying about me.
Oh, I forgot, you weren't.

 Based on the results of this General Election and the fact that America is now a Socialist Nation, I no longer desire to live.
The things I held dear are now gone.
My life's goals, efforts, and plans are dead.
I have made the decision to no longer take any of my medicines and to no longer accept any medical help.
It is my right and I am claiming that right.
This is the last post on this blog.
I have no more to say.
Good bye.

Do you know what I hate about having LBD?
I hate not being me.
The old me, what I was, with the capabilities and energy I used to have.
The ability to remember complex things, names, or even to flush the toilet!
Today, I was at a Gideon's event at a Fall Festival held by our local Hospital.
I was talking to strangers, handing out New Testaments, and interacting with those of our Gideon Camp for four hours.
I was exhausted!
About two and a half hours into the event I had to sit down!
And I never really rebounded after that.
The old me could go for 12 hours and be energized by the crowd.
Of course, the old me could mow, trim, edge, and sweep the yard, front and back, and then wash and wax the car, and then be ready for a social activity at night!
But, those days are gone.
There are things I still love to do, but they are too taxing for me and I usually just think about them.
Family, acquaintances, friends, don't realize how this disease effects me.
My wife has the best grasp of how my mind and body works, but she even pushes me to do things.
Yes, I know she is pushing me to do things to help me and keep me i the best mental and physical shape I can be.
ANd yes, I understand that and appreciate it.
But maybe not at the time she is trying to ge me to do something!
If you get my drift.
I hate getting tired, forgetting, not being able to do, physically and mentally, the things I used to.
But what I hate the most is knowing I am as good as I will ever be. 
</doc>
<doc date=Saturday, October 20, 2012>
It is hard to believe that I retired almost three years ago.
I remember the events that lead my wife and I to the decision that I could no longer fully and efficiently do what the taxpayers paid me to do.
I remember filling out the paperwork for a disability retirement, getting all the medical justifications and submitting it to my boss.
I vivid remember the day I received the letter from OPM telling me I was granted a Disability Retirement ant to be off the rolls quickly.
After I read that letter, I told my wife;  "I MUST be bad off, they approved my request the first time through!"
But what do I miss being retired?
First and foremost, the daily interaction with my coworkers.
I worked with many of these folks for 20 years.
We traveled all over the world together, rode the wire down from a helicopter to ships and back up again.
We promoted together and worked together to make the fleet more combat ready.
And yes, we rode and worked on ships in combat ones, doing tech assists and crew training in real time events.
Those people are family to me and I miss them terribly.
Second, I miss doing something that is important!
What I did and what they do IS important to the security of our nation.
I helped to recover the USS Cole, worked on the investigation of the turret explosion on the USS Iowa, helped the Navy inspect and accept new construction ships, and did repairs that ensured ships could do their mission.
Again, what we did was important, and stressful.
I will tell yo what I don't miss.
The stress!!
Some unnecessary and some a normal part of the importance of the mission.
Some individuals up the chain of command LOVE to put unnecessary, inappropriate, stress on those who are down the chain of command, just because they can!
I saw GS 14 and GS 15 managers who's only desire in life was to watch those who worked for them squirm!!
I just don't miss their ego trips.
I also don't miss those telephone calls from the Command Duty Officer at 3 AM or 5PM on Sunday, for a tech assist on a ship, 3000 miles away!
I can now actually sleep all night without the telephone ringing!
I also don't miss useless data calls!
You know, those immediate, emergency, demands for a report on the number of pencils you will use in the next century, categorized by color, use, function, and date of the first shipment.
Oh yes, that report is due by noon TODAY and it is 10:30 AM now, the first time you even heard of the requirement!
I don't miss that stupidity.
Retirement, getting away from the stress and pressures of my position, has been one of two factors that has extended my usable life.
That and my Neurologist's dogged determination to accurately diagnose my problems and get me on Razadyne and Namenda early enough for them to help me!
Those two events, in concert, have given me three years of good family time, good friend time, good retirement time.
If I had been able to effectively fulfill the requirements of my position, I would still be working.
But I could not, so here I am.
Linda and I appreciate and cherish every moment we have together and I thank GOD for making this time available.
This truly is the best time of our lives!

How does your mind work?
Are you one of those people who's mind runs all the time?
It never stops,  You think of solutions to problems that have not yet occurred?
I used to be that way.
Now, I have to really try to think of things.
Otherwise, my mind is blank.
When I do think, I often think about my past and I am very comfortable with that.
My Navy career is often the topic of my thoughts and dreams.
And again, I am comfortable with that also.
However, I do have thoughts that I do not like.
Sometimes, I think of the thing I have done that are not so noble.
Those things I did wrong either by mistake or on purpose.
Many of these "Sins" are from my youth but not all of them.
They are all "Confessed" to GOD but the bother me anyway.
In many cases, I did or said something that hurt someone I loved.
Other events that come to mind are things that I know went wrong, were my fault either by action or inaction,  and resulted in a problem, a catastrophe, or could have related in serious injury or loss.
Sometimes these thoughts, memories, of my shortcomings cause me anxiety, sadness, or even depression.
I hate and regret the fact that I hurt someone's feelings or wronged someone.
I often wish I could tell everyone that I wronged that I am sorry.
But the thought crosses my mind that they probably don't even remember.
But that may be me trying to sooth my conscience.
None of us is perfect.
In the Book of Romans it is written; "None is righteous, no not one"  and; "All have sinned and fallen short of the Glory of GOD".
I know this, but in these days of living mentally in the past, I still relive my failures.
I wonder if others on the same journey as I am have the same problems?

<doc date=Saturday, October 13, 2012>
My recent denial for admission to the Armed Forces Retirement Home was difficult to take.
I was really looking forward to living my life out with some shipmates.
Having people round you that have shared experiences helps, I believe.
But, after discussing this decision with my wife, it may be a good thing too.
Especially since we could not live together there.
Visits overnight yes, full time living, no.
But I have been having difficulty with how I feel for the last week or so.
My wife says I am more depressed, and that may be.
But, we discussed my feelings tonight and a few things came out.
First of all, people act like I have a disease that THEY will catch!!
Alzheimer's, Lewy Body Dementia, Dementia, Depression, OLD, are NOT contagious!!
As a matter of fact, IF OLD is contagious, I would think everyone would want to catch it!
It seems everyone wants to live forever.
Not me, but the health industry is based on keeping people alive and looking good, forever.
Trust me, after a face life, hair dye, and liposuction, you still look old!!
Preserved, but old!
Second, no one seems to want me as a volunteer.
I volunteered twice to hold at risk babies at the hospital.
The USS Alabama finally returned my call after three attempts.
But, they only want me to work on week days and my ride is only available on week ends.
So, that may be an issue.
I continue to have difficulty finding an active ministry to utilize my GOD given talents.
There is a Church that wants to establish an AWANA program, but they are slow to react.
Like anyother organization they want fast results but they have not done the required up front work.
And, they have not listened to us yet.
Gideon's is far to removed from active ministry for me.
They serve a great purpose, but it is not my style.
Other things have had a negative impact on my psyche.
For instance, I just learned about an abortion technique called "Live Birth Abortion".
It has depressed and upset me more than anything happening to me.
Check this abomination out on line!!
You will be upset too.
My country is falling apart and I can't do anything about it.
Because of my disease, I am unable to be an active participant in life.
This frustrates me and probably does not help my depression.
I used to get extremely angry and agitated over things like this.
I would scream at the television, get angry, tell others about what angered me, and in general stir up a lot of dust.
Now, I just sit and shake my head.
So, all of this, combines, is effecting me.
Depression, probably.
But it is more like surrendering to the way things are now.
As much as I would like to fix the things that I see as wrong, I know I cannot.
And for me, that is an overwhelming issue.

I had it all planned out.
I applied to the Armed Forces Retirement Home in Gulfport, Mississippi.
I took a tour and Linda and I were very impressed with the facility.
They even have a Memory Care facility!
I thought, what a great place for me.
I could be with other career military folks and especially, retired Navy folks!
Linda would move to Gulfport and I would see her everyday.
When my condition got worse, the Navy home had the facilities to deal with me.
Those plans were changed today!
It seems the bureaucrats that run the Armed Forces Retirement Home don't want me because I have a diagnosis of Dementia!
Actually, Lewy Body Dementia, but they only concentrate on the Dementia part.
Even though I am in fair to good shape now and still able to do things on my own.
I drive, manage long term money, and dress and feed myself.
I even go to the bathroom on my own!
Hell, I am better off than most people under 25!!
But, my honesty on the admission forms caused them concerns.
It seems no one wants those of us suffering from a Dementia related disease.
My wife and I applied to Westminister Canterbury in Virginia Beach and they turned me down for the same reason.
But they wanted six figure money to get in as a well person.
That on top of $2000 per month!
And that was with us having Long Term Care insurance!
I guess I understand their point.
I would be an expensive patient a few years down the road.
But wait, I got this disease because of my Naval service!
They don't see it that way.
So, instead of getting upset or depressed, I need to formulate a new plan.
Right now, I am looking for property in central Alabama to build Fort Donnie on!
My cement house, a gun tower, escape hatches out of the house, a bomb proof basement!
I almost have this plan complete!
I am still working on the air supply for the bomb shelter and I have a few kinks to iron out over my solar and wind powered electrical system.
But I am close!
I will keep you informed on my progress.

I lost a friend this week.
He was a wonderful person.
Humorous, intelligent,  generous, caring, and TOUGH!
He was really tough.
He suffered through kidney cancer, loosing one kidney and then the other along with his bladder and all connecting plumbing.
Yet, through all of his journey he maintained his independence and his drive to be as upbeat as possible.
I actually heard him complain more about the Steelers loosing than his medical condition.
He hated to ask for help even though his many friends loved to help him.
He knew that his condition would cause him to die yet he never gave in or quit.
As a matter of fact, he worked, without kidneys or a bladder until just a few months ago.
But now, he is at rest and his journey is done.
Barry was an example for anyone to follow whether you have a hang nail or cancer!
I have said that getting old is not for wimps!
And my Dad used to say, youth is wasted on the young.
But true TOUGH guys don't let the difficulties of life get them down.
They look for the good parts of life and see the positive things around them.
That is what Barry taught us in how he lived life and how he faced death.
Great lessons like that are only taught by great individuals.
We should listen to them more and complain about our conditions less.

Even with the effects of LBD, there are things that I still get excited about.
For instance, I love cars!
Old cars, new cars, Hot Rods, Race Cars, and especially Corvettes!
I like to go to car shows, car dealers, and I love to watch Barrett-Jackson car auctions on the SPEED Channel.
When the Scottsdale auction is on in January, I watch all 6 days of the event!
I would love to go the Scottsdale and see the event in person!
Cars are one of the things that still spin my clock.
The second thing that excites me is guns.
The BIG guns of a World War Two Battleship, my ever favorite, MK 42 5"/54 rapid fire gun mounts, .50 caliber machine guns, and all rifles and pistols.
I love to shoot any rifle or pistol, of any caliber.
I love to teach individuals how to shoot and how to be accurate.
I have taught many men,  women, and children to love the shooting sports.
One of the young men I helped start in the shooting sports has won about every competition in defensive pistol shooting!
I had a had in starting him, but it was his skills that lead him to the championships!
But, shooting spins my clock!
Another endeavor that gives me great joy is serving Jesus Christ.
AS you may know, for a brief and very fulfilling time, I was an ordained Lay Pastor.
I am not highly educated in Theology, but I have a heart for the Lord and I want everyone to know about Jesus Christ and what HE did for me and what HE can do for you.
I dearly enjoy preaching GOD's Word and witnessing to anyone who will listen.
I bring these three important things that I find enjoyable up because, they are what keeps me going and keeps me positive through this journey.
I know I will not be able to do all or any of these things in the future, but right now, I cling to them with all my might.
They keep me on this side of the disease and that is where I intend to stay as long as GOD wants me to.

<doc date=Friday, October 5, 2012>
I have done quite a bit of research on LBD, Alzheimer's, and other dementias.
There are many articles on how the diseases effect the patient but nothing written about how the patient effects the disease!
For instance, on the LBDA.org sight, I read about a study that arrived at the conclusion that prescribing Arecept and Namenda early in the progression of LBD greatly slows the progression of the memory loss component of the disease.
And WEBMD states that the life expectancy of an individual diagnosed with LBD is two to twenty years!
That's a large span and I wonder how the attitude of the patient and his or her family and friends effect the patient's life expectancy.
I have tried to maintain a very positive attitude but I find that now, four years or so into my journey I am having more and more trouble keeping myself on an even keel.
The effects of LBD are impacting me even more each day.
Loss of memory, muscle pain, lack of energy, muscle weakness, unstable on my feet, shaking when I exert myself, exhaustion, well you get the idea,  These issues make it difficult to keep a positive attitude because I know they will only get worse.
And what is even worse is that I know Lewy has some new negative issues just around the corner.
I know, because I have had a few run ins with a few of those issues!
What issues, incontinence, constipation, vision issues, and fear.
You can see how these issues can deflate a positive attitude.
Just the same, I want to remain positive and engaged.
Another issues is my recent emotional sensitivity.
I have written before about this, but it continues to impact me.
I see insults and rebukes where there are none.
Either that or I am being picked on and I never saw it before.
These issues also linger on.
All of these issues combine to cause me to withdraw and be negative.
Maybe the disease effects the attitude and not the other way around!
I really don't know and now, after putting this all in print, I am even more confused.
During the time I have been writing this, my emotions have completely shifted and I am now depressed, withdrawn, and upset.
Maybe I should just let this happen instead of trying to effect the disease with my attitude.
Maybe I will just go to bed.

I had a realization that I might be turning this site into a Whine Fest!
It was never my intent to indulge in self pity.
Just the opposite, I want to share my journey in a positive and truthful manner.
Now, some of the things I have reported do come across as negative, and that is the impact of LBD or any Dementia.
But there are interesting and even humorous things that happen, if you just look.
For instance, the other day, my wife walked past me and I saw her in a blue blouse.
I commented on it, only to be told she was only wearing her bra!
I looked again and I saw that she was correct.
No big deal, and somewhat funny.
You just have to look at the things that occur, out of the ordinary, with curiosity and humor.
I remember in the third "Pirates of the Caribbean" movie that Jack was effected with the curse of the gold coin.
He was in the day light and could see the bones in his hand.
His reply; "Now that is interesting, very interesting!"
That is how I try to look at the hallucinations, my teetering over, or my forgetfulness.
It is interesting how I see a blue blouse when there is none or remember a name one day and not the next.
Instead of obsessing over it, I have to look at it as something new and so should the caretaker.
So, I will try to be more humorous, more inquisitive, and more upbeat!

Life always continues to change.
In the Navy, we had a saying;  "The only constant is CHANGE, and the rate of that is variable!"
That was certainly true before my Lewy Body diagnosis and it has only accelerated more as of late.
We moved to the Pensacola Florida area last October specifically to be close to my son and his family.
We had lived 600 miles apart for eight years.
Because of job moves, they lived in up state New York and we were in Virginia Beach, Virginia.
When they moved to the Pensacola area, we visited to check out their new home and as a family, we had a discussion about living close again.
My on wanted to take a daily part in my journey and Linda and I welcomed that.
So, we moved Florida.
That move came with many issues and emotional problems that I deal with even now, a year later.
I miss the Tidewater area of Virginia.
We lived there for over 30 years and it is home to me.
But, it is comforting to be close to my son and his family.
They are there to help us and that is a blessing.
One of the most emotional and difficult parts of this move has been leaving my friends and my Church family.
My Church, Grace Community Church, Virginia Beach, is a loving, Bible centered Church.
It is small in size but BIG in service.
I liked to call our Church a Hugging and Eating Church because we hugged everyone and had some great meals together.
My Pastor helped me grow spiritually and personally.
He encouraged me to preach GOD's word and my Church family bestowed upon me the honor of Ordination.
That singularly was the greatest honor ever given to me.
Greater than anything I did in the Navy, as a Civil Servant, or as a human.
Serving GOD, Preaching and Teaching HIS word is the greatest honor anyone can have.
I miss my Church, the fellowship, the spiritual support, and being an Associate Pastor to that great group of people more than anything.
We have search for a new Church home, but finding what we had at Grace is difficult if not impossible.
Yes, we will find a new Church Home but I will never find a new HOME Church!
And that emotional void hurts.
So, this issue becomes one of my LBD issues.
While living in Florida has it's positives,  there has been some emotional issues that have been difficult to deal with and have left me feeling empty and lost.
Long distance relationships are always difficult.
Being with people is always better than talking to people.
Our best friends, Jerry and Marcia have paid us a visit and that was wonderful.
Now, if I could only get them to move to Florida.
Maybe I should try to establish a Grace Brethren Church in Gulf Breeze!
But honestly, I am not physically or mentally equipped to accomplish that.
Yes, I know I can do all things through Jesus Christ who strengthens me, bt I have not been given any spiritual direction to undertake this endeavor.
So, I continue to try to make a connection with a local Ministry that I can work in and there is some movement to establish an AWANA program at a local Church.
The Pastor there is personal, energetic, and interested in reaching people for the Lord.
So, I may be back in AWANA again and that would be great.
Only time will tell.
I present this issue to you to further illustrate how difficult it is to disrupt the routine of an individual with any Dementia.
Yes, I am only at Phase II or III but it still has caused me emotional and mental distress.
I also write this to be completely honest and open about this journey.
I have noticed that I am more emotional, less thick skinned, and easily hurt over statements made too me and emotions that would have been brushed off in a day gone by.
Not, I am easily upset, angered, and emotionally injured easily and I find it more difficult to heal.
I dwell on issues and things of the past.
Things I have down wrong and things done wrong to me.
Yes, all sins confessed to GOD and buried in the deepest ocean with a "No Fishing" sign posted!
but, I am now weakened and vulnerable.
And I now strike out over that hurt.
Verbally or by withdrawing from the situation but still my way of getting back at the individual or the situation.
I beat myself up over these things and sometime I find relief.
But that relief is getting hard to find....

<doc date=Monday, September 24, 2012>
I was at a Gideon's meeting tonight and one of our members had a prayer request for himself.
He said his wife had Alzheimer's and that he had issues being angry with her over her disease and the situations it presents.
He was frustrated with his situation and with himself and Linda and I understood.
I talked with him after our meeting and told him I had Dementia also and my wife had many of the same issues.
I also recommended the local Alzheimer's Support group.
He was not interested.
Why, because he wants to do this on his own!
That's not abnormal for many men and women who are of a "Type A" personality.
When something happens that we cannot fix, we immediately get angry and make even more attempts to fix the issue, each time getting more frustrated.
The "Type A" personality will never give up but will get more and more frustrated until he breaks!
Help, professional help, is the issue but it is seldom accepted.
Now I write from experience since I and my wife are "Type A" personality individuals and neither of us likes to ask for help.
But, we did attend an Alzheimer's Association support group and it did give us some insight.
But we did not take advantage of the help in depth.
But realize, this is a brutal disease that impacts both the sufferer and the caregiver!
And that impact is negative, immediate, and everlasting!
There is no cure for the disease or the mental anguish for the caregiver!
So, outside, professional, help is recommended not only by those who are educated in this area but by me!
I had a neurologist asked me how I was dealing with my disease.
I told her I thought I was doing well and she immediately said; "No your not!"
It shocked me.
Not her abruptness but her correctness.
I had been fooling myself, smiling through the tough times, keeping a stiff upper lip, toughing it out, what ever phrase you use to cover up your fear, desperation, and depression!
I know what people want to hear, I know the "proper" responses, and I can put forth a facade of being normal.
But, inside, I know I am not  the way I used to be and the changes terrify me!
The physical weakness, lack of energy,loss of motor skills, and lack of stability in walking.
The mental issues of loss of my short term memory, inability to select the correct word, fear, getting lost, and the overwhelming feeling of doom.
Yes, Dementia, in any name, is a devastating diagnosis.
But look at the disease from the care giver's point of view.
The one they were planning on traveling with in retirement, the one who they walk on the beach with, the one the caregiver has spent his or her life with is now gone or at least going.
Yes, leaving!
Oh yes, the sufferer is still there, physically, but not mentally!
And it is the mental part of our loved one that we interact with and love.
So that loss is the most traumatic part for the caregiver.
So, again, outside professional help is not only needed, it is required if the caregiver is going to survive the ordeal mentally and possibly physically!
Stress can induce strokes or heart attacks for those who are in a weakened state!
Another issue is providing a break for the caregiver!
There are memory support units that provide daily or weekly respite care and I recommend that for every caregiver.
I know my wife is refreshed by outings out without me or worry about me.
So, tonight's interface with another family suffering the pain of Alzheimer's.
Presently dealing with their condition unsuccessfully!
But maybe, our interface will encourage them to seek assistance.
They still have a long journey ahead of them.

Today, I woke up dizzy!
OK, there's a joke in there somewhere, but I mean I was dizzy.
My head felt numb and I was very unsteady on my feet.
Today was the day we had planned to go to the Commissary so I was determined to carry out our day's plans.
I took a shower and was glad our builder, D.R.Horton, redid out master bath shower at cost complete with three grip bars!
I held on with one hand and washed with the other.
It worked and we headed for the Commissary.
Riding in the car was difficult in the beginning.
No, not because I am the world's worst passenger.
But because the effect of things speeding towards me was overwhelming!
That sensation subsided after a while.
In the Commissary, I did fairly well until checkout!
Getting the items out of the cart and onto the checkout conveyor was difficult.
The up and down movement made me dizzy, or more dizzy!
But, we made it home and after unloading the groceries, I was able to sit down and rest and I felt somewhat better.
We took a nap in the afternoon and now I feel better.
I consider myself a good boy today!
I did not even consider driving today!
I knew I was not in any shape to drive.
Again, like the incident where I did not know I had clothes on, dizzy is a new issue.
I don't know if it is related to my LBD or an inner ear issue.
I did not have any allergy issues, no congestion, no coughing, no, sneezing, so I lean towards LBD.
And, since LBD does effect different parts of the brain, it makes sense to me.
Oh well, it's another thing to put on the question list for the neurologist appointment in December.
As have said before, things are progressing and starting to effect me more.
I am more emotional and more tired.
It is to be expected and I am handling it OK.
But, I also know I am really in a fight to the finish.

<doc date=Wednesday, September 19, 2012>
OK, here is a new and disturbing issue.
Yesterday, I was out at a Church meeting and I wore long pants and a nice shirt.
I even has socks and shoes on!
Believe me, here in Florida, that is "Formal" wear!
When I came home, I got undressed and sat on the couch drinking a cup of coffee and watching television.
My son called and said he was coming over to set up our new printer.
I took the call and then I got up from the couch and told my wife; "I'd better get my pants on if we are going to have company."
The problem was, I had my shorts and a t-shirt on!
I actually felt as if I was sitting in my undershorts and I was convinced of it even as my wife told me I had my shorts on.
Sanding up, I had to look and feel my shorts before I was convinced.
This is the first time I have had this issue and it unnerved me to say the least!
Now, after I saw I was wearing shorts, I was OK and I felt fully dressed.
But, just the same, I was upset that this issue had surfaced.
So, next visit with the neurologist, I will have a new issue to discuss.
I hope he does not reply; "I was expecting that."

<doc date=Thursday, September 13, 2012>
We are independent beings.
When we become old enough to get our driver's license we are standing at the DMV with our money in hand.
Independence at last!!!
Do you remember that wonderful feeling?
So now, skip ahead a few decades, you know something is wrong.
You mind is slower, you can't remember things, your motor skills are not what they were, so you go to your doctor.
Tests, questions, maybe a PET scan, maybe an EEG, and then the verdict;  You have a Dementia type disease.
What do you do now?
What happens to your independence?
All of us who are on the journey called LBD know exactly what I am saying.
A rush of thought go through your mind and one of the first was probably how long can I drive?!
Yes, the thought of life expectancy was there, would I need to be institutionalized, how long before I get bad, but my independence was foremost in my mind.
I still drive, but I am much more careful, defensive, deliberate, than I was.
I never drive when I am tired and I seldom drive at night.
And, I have started to let my wife drive more ofter.
She is a very good driver and I trust her without question.
But she will tell you I am a terrible passenger!!
Just the same, a slow transition resulting in me no longer driving is the right thing.
I was very fortunate because my Neurologist diagnosed my disease very early!
That has permitted us to work out the future before it happened.
That also permitted the memory support drugs, Raxadyne and Namenda to work their magic.
Now I know they are beginning to reach the end of their effectiveness, but we are ready.
I know friends who either had a very quick onset of Dementia or denied the warning signs and symptoms and delayed seeking treatment until it was too late for the drugs to help.
So, this edition of advice is simple; First;  Go to your doctor as soon as you feel the symptoms occurring!!
This is the most important thing you can do for yourself!!!
Second;  Make a plan with your spouse, your children, for the progression of the disease.
Third;  Begin a process that will gradually lead to YOU no longer driving!
My plan gives my wife total control over my driving.
I even have this in my Living Will and my Medical documents.
She knows me best, especially after 40 years of marriage, so she knows when I am unable to drive.
Fourth;  For the caretaker, take your new passenger out, even when there is no where to go.
This will enhance his feeling of being independent as he looses that independence.
These things have worked for us.
But, as the old commercial used to say; "I am not a doctor, and I don't play one on TV."
so discuss this with your doctor when you do what I recommended in step one!
You and you spouse are the strongest part of your support group.
Yes, a great GP and a understanding Neurologist is important, but they don't see you 24/7.
Your spouse does so listen to that person!
They won't steer you wrong.

Today, my wife, my son's Sister in Law, and myself took a very informative walking tour of the historic district of Pensacola.
Since we moved to Florida, we have been trying to acclimate and my wife thought this was a good opportunity to learn more about Pensacola's history.
The tour was two hours long and conducted by a History Professor from a local college with 50 years teaching experience.
He was marvelously entertaining and very informed.
It was naturally hot our and very humid, but this is East LA!
But, I am sure you really want to know how I did with my wheeled walker.
I believe the correct name for my device is rotalator.
In any case, it and I did very well.
I purchased a model with eight inch wheels and it handled the bumps, cracks, and sidewalk debris without a hitch.
But the best part was the seat!!
Other people in the tour, those not needing the assistance of a device like mine, were envious.
At every stop on the tour, I had an instant, comfortable seat, and I used it!
This kept me from getting too tired.
One of my issues is stamina.
I get tired quickly when I am out walking or doing something.
My cane helps me keep stable, but a long walk, or in this case, tour, makes me tired.
Without a place to sit down, I am in trouble.
So, I  normally avoid this type of event.
Now with the walker, I will be able to go more places.
In the past, I would have been embarrassed to use such a device, but now, I use what works.
The heck with appearances, and I recommend one for anyone with issues like mine.
You have a choice;  You can either stay home, fall down, or use a device that works for you!
And like I said, I was the envy of 50 people.
So, I would say my first outing was a success!
</doc>
<doc date=Friday, September 7, 2012>
When I was first diagnosed, like so many of you, my neurologist and my GP both thought I had Parkinson's Disease.
But I had memory issues that predated the problems with my stiffness and stability issues,  So she went deeper and after extensive testing, determined I had LBD.
My leg and arm stiffness was an issue and I was prescribed Requip which I have terrible issues with and then Sinemet.
I took the Sinemet for about two years until the nausea became too much for me to deal with.
I told my neurologist I would rather put up with the stiffness than the nausea.
So, for about two years, I have been off and Parkinson's meds concentrating only on my memory issues and tolerating the stiffness.
Well, I believe, no I know the time has come to restart the Parkinson's medicines.
The pain in my legs.
lower back, and arms, has become constant and is increasing in intensity.
Also, my instability has increased.
Tomorrow we plan to attend a History walk of Pensacola.
It is scheduled to last two hours and for the first time, I am taking my wheeled walker.
So, I am going to ask my neurologist for a recommendation on a medicine to reduce this pain and rigidity.
So again, things progress.
</doc>
<doc date=Monday, September 3, 2012>
Those of you who fight the daily fight with LBD know what I am about to say.
The rest of you are cringing in your boots for fear of what I am going to say.
Everyday, those of us afflicted with LBD choose to fight the fight.
To get out of bed, eat, deal with our digestive systems, walk, interact with other people, and do the things that those without LBD do.
We have to make this conscience choice because there comes a time that it is easier to say NO!
That's right, NO I won't do it anymore.
I suffer from this problem from time to time.
Not because I have progressed so far down the LBD road, but because I sometime fail to see the reason to keep up the fight.
Sometimes it seems futile.
I can't do what I once could.
I don't remember what I once knew.
I don't want to do the things I once did.
The other issue is family, friends, others, don't seem to understand the frustration I face, the effort I expend, to look "normal" to them, to function in their world.
Everyone wants everything to be as it was but I know it can't and never will be.
Many times they get frustrated at me because I am not interested in the things of life.
So, I try to put on a brave face and go about doing things I am not interested in.
It is futility.
So, a constant dance goes on in the life of the LBD sufferer and the LBD caregivers and loved ones.
Sometimes one of us gets frustrated and feelings get bruised, other times the facade holds.
It is a constant dance.
One thing I have learned that helps me it to have a mental mission to keep mentally and physically for.
No, I am not just talking military mission but things we plan or desire to do that will require me to be in good spirits.
For instance, my favorite ship, the USS Caron (DD 970) is having a reunion in Washington D.C. in October 2013.
I will be there if I have to take a Greyhound bus!!
That event keeps me trying to maintain or even get stronger, more mobile, and mentally more connected!
I want to see my shipmates one more time.
So, when you LBD sufferer seems out of sort, uninterested in life, or seems to just want to give up, give him some room and some time to gain control of these emotions.
If you can, help you LBD sufferer find that special mission to focus on.
However, pushing him or her will only exacerbate the problem and may cause a blow up that both of you will regret.
It's just the way it is!
</doc>
<doc date=Thursday, August 30, 2012>
I notice more and more that I get agitated, and angry at the drop of a hat.
Tonight my wife was listening to silly ring tone samples on her IPAD.
That should not have invoked anger or frustration in me, they were funny, but I got agitated and angry over the noise.
This seems to be happening more and more.
A few days ago I was putting up the storm covers for the windows for the first time.
I got screaming angry over the problems installing them.
Again, I would not have had this problem a few years ago.
So, I went to WEB MD to check the LBD symptoms and there they were.
Agitation and anger.
Now that does not make controlling my temper any easier, but at least my wife and I can understand why this is happening.
Today, I took down the storm covers.
Naturally this was much easier, so I attempted it myself.
Bad Idea!
I got so sweaty, tired, and unstable on my feet that I had to sit sown between windows to rest.
Now I was not rushing but just going at a slow pace.
Just the same, my body cannot deal with exertion and by the time I was done, I was panting like I had run a marathon!
Linda told me, that was the last time I did that alone.
I'd like to argue, but I know she is right.
So, that issue caused me to get upset over living in a house vice an apartment or community for people over 55 or more.
You see, we sold our home in Virginia Beach and moved into an over 55 complex to get me away from home maintenance.
When we moved to Florida to be next to the grandsons and my son and daughter in law, we bought a home because it made financial sense.
But not physical sense for me.
Again, I can rationalize the decision but I get emotionally agitated over the end product!!
So, while some people, who watch me from the outside, say that I am not getting worse, I know that I am.
And frankly, their attitude pisses me off too!
MY best friend's Mom had Lumpus.
She was a trooper and tougher than most men.
She dealt with her infirmities in a stoic manner and made the best effort not to have he disease rule her life.
At her Grand Daughter's wedding, people kept asking her how she was doing which was beginning to get to her.
I was the one who asked that question and put her over the top.
She said to me;  FINE, how are you doing!!!
I learned my lesson and never asked her again.
The moral of that story is, be honest with me.
If I seem worse, tell me, don't tell me what you think I want to hear.
Because I really don't want your platitudes or sympathy.
AS President Reagan said, there I go again!
Maybe I will take a chill pill and relax in a dark room.

I received a comment from a reader today.
That reader commented on my Navy blog but also commented on a post my wife placed on this blog a while ago.
He told me I had a great wife!
I have known that for almost 40 years!
But, it was good to get someone else's opinion too.
She has always stood by me, encouraged me, kept me in line, told me when I was wrong, which in itself is a tough job, and now, has become my caregiver.
Some of you may not think I need a caregiver yet, but I do.
For instance, I can no longer make sense of all the medications I take.
And keeping medical appointments is not in my ability either.
But, her biggest task right now is to be my sounding board.
I need someone to talk to, be with, and tell my inner fears to.
I suffer from serious insecurity issues.
I am constantly asking her if I did this or that correctly.
Now, I never had that issue before, but now, I need to know I can still do something well enough to pass inspection.
Of course, what I can do is limited.
I'm not even permitted to drive the riding lawn mower, but sometime I sneak a few laps in before I get caught.
Truth is, I get over heated and suffer from excess sweating at the drop of a hat.
So, her care and attention IS necessary because I am hard headed, still!
I know her role in my disease is very difficult.
And she has the most difficult times to come!
I appreciate her love and care and I appreciate the difficult times to come.
I try to make her load lighter, but there will come a time when I will be unable to help her.
Yet, my wife is always there, by my side, keeping me on track.
I could not ask for anything better.

I have a place in my mind that I go, very often.
It is a place that fits my needs and that I am familiar with.
Everything is as I want it and I am comfortable and safe.
In control.
Every night, before I go to sleep, my mind goes to this place of serenity.
It relaxes me and helps me go to sleep.
No matter how the day went or how I feel, this trip to my comfortable place is a guarantee of sleep.
Some times I build a house in my mind, other times I modify a truck for a specific purpose.
Sometimes I work in my garden, or just ride my ATV around my property to make sure all is secure.
If you are interested, my house is made of steel reinforced concrete and is easy to heat and cool.
It is a small house, 1000 square feet, with one bedroom, one bath, a living room and a kitchen.
The doors are braced from the inside for security against intruders.
I also have an outside kitchen for summer cooking and canning.
I use solar and wind turbines to make electricity.
No connections to civilization.
No cable TV, no city water or sewer.
Just me and my home, secure against intruders, self sufficient, standing against the onslaught of evil.
It seems, more and more, I seek refuse in my comfortable, safe place.
I wonder if others with Dementia have this escape too.
I have never told anyone about this until now.
Why, I don't know.

Well, I finally received a telephone call from my GP about the nuclear stress test I took 13 days ago!
I had determined that I was OK when they permitted me to leave the hospital after the test!
No ambulance, no chest scars, no IV, just me walking out.
So, I figured I was OK.
However, 13 days is a long time to wait for test results that could have foretold of big issues.
But, I should be happy that I am fine and I am.
Second, My left thumb developed a click every time I move the end of my thumb.
The pain began to increase so I went to my GP and he sent me to a "Hand" specialist.
This specialist was wonderful.
His office x-rayed my hand, the Doctor looked at my hand and told me it was a tendon issue that may be cured with a cortisone injection.
AS he said, he gave me three chances to run away from the "shot", but I stayed and received the treatment.
I am glad to say my thumb is feeling better.
I hope it stays that was, surgery is not in my health care plan.
I told you all before, no more tests.
Well, the nuclear stress test was out of my control, but no surgery except life threatening situations.
On the disease front, my wife believes my hallucinations have increased.
I agree.
Nothing frightening, just strange things like birds flying through the living room, the feel of someone moving across the bed, and my usual small mammals running around on the floor.
I continue to get tired easily and sweat profusely at the least little exertion.
Maybe a little more exasperation with the world around me, but that may be related to the political season.
Or maybe not.
I guess I will know in November.
</doc>
<doc date=Tuesday, August 7, 2012>
I have had hallucinations for quite a while.
Some of them are fairly benign.
For instance, a small rodent running across the floor, movement out of the corner of my eye, or a dog going into a room when my dog is laying next to me.
I have seen people, but not as ofter.
Once, in my bedroom, I saw two girls sitting on a bench against the bedroom wall at the foot of the bed.
They were dressed in white old style dresses.
None of these hallucinations frighten me because I know, for now, that they are not real.
Last night, I was sitting on the couch with my feet up and for some reason, I saw my foot and that startled me!
I guess I did not expect my foot to be there.
One point of interest, the vast majority of my hallucinations are in the evening or night.
I credit this to the effects of  my "Sun Downing".
I also have touch and auditory hallucinations.
Many times I have the feeling of someone moving on the bed when I am the only person on the bed.
That happened today when I took my afternoon nap.
I have also experienced a human touch on my shoulder when no one was in the room except me.
I hear my wife's voice when she is not talking or not even in the room.
Many times, I have gone and found her in another room and ask if she called.
Again, all of these issues are normal for someone with LBD.
My wife has grown to accept them and my reaction to them.
While I don't tell her about everyone, I tell her about new ones or nights when the visions are particularly plentiful.
I also know, someday, I will not deal with these issues as logical as I do now.
But, for now, they are just entertainment.

I have been writing this blog for a while.
It came to being because of my wife and my neurologist, Doctor Mary Bowles.
They both believed it would be therapeutic for me and also a record of my long journey into eternity and they were right.
But I never knew that what I wrote would be useful to others.
But your comments have caused me to understand that all of us in the Lewy Body community, sufferers and caregivers, benefit from sharing our experiences.
The best support group is you, who read all of the Blogs written through the challenges and pain of this mysterious disease.
I call it mysterious because even Medical Doctors don't know what Lewy Body Dementia is.
We, all of us, are pioneers and together we will inform anyone who wants to know and educate those who will listen.
I wish to convey my heartfelt respect for those of you on this journey.
I was informed today that this Blog was awarded a Best Blog award from Healthline.com.
It was one of 25 other Blogs recognized in the Dementia community.
I was surprised and honored by this award.
It is recognition of the efforts of my wife and you, the readers.
Thank you for being part of my journey.
We have a new look for our Blog and I hope you like it.
Again, it is the artistic efforts of my wife that make this Blog possible.
She is the my love, caregiver, and mentor.
Of course, we will gladly take inputs and ideas.
Your comments are always welcome.
Again, thanks for being there!

I hate to keep you waiting, but I do not know how well or bad I did on the nuclear stress test.
Back in the Navy, when we had our nuclear stress tests, call Nuclear Technical Proficiency Inspection, (NTPI) we knew immediately how well we did.
For instance if the Weapons Officer and the ASW Officer were immediately fired, we knew we did bad!
And if the Captain was smiling, we knew we did well.
But, those who administer this test have the ability to tell you nothing!
No matter how much you plead.
How do I think I did?
OK.
It took three levels of incline and speed to get my heart to the target heart rate.
My blood pressure at that point was 140/80.
My target pulse was 136.
I had no chest pain and I could still breath.
Additionally, the nurses and technicians did not stop the test abruptly and throw me on the gurney and I was permitted to go home.
So, nothing can be too wrong.
Or can it?
When the doctor tells me, I will tell all of you.
Until then, we are in the dark.
The symptoms that started this testing are still there, and they may always be.
If this is from my LBD, I guess I will have to live with it.
Again, I await my doctor's call.
Maybe Monday.

OK, That sounds like they are going to blow something up and see if something else can stand the blast!!
And I guess that is exactly what they are going to do to me tomorrow morning.
I got the call today and was scheduled for my stress test tomorrow morning.
There was an opening for tomorrow and I decided to take it.
Why wait, jump in and test the water.
But, I will be truthful with you and tell you I am apprehensive about this test.
I am still pretty tough and I can take a fair amount of pain.
When I had half of my colon removed, I did not take the any meds prescribed for me and I got off the pain pump in the hospital quick.
I don't like narcotic pain meds and will do just about anything to stay away from them.
But Dentists and heart tests still terrify me!
Since I have had these sweating, shortness of breath, and low energy issues I have been concerned about my heart but I was also told that my symptoms were probably related to my LBD.
Also, based on what I have read about LBD on WebMD and the Lewy Body Dementia Association site, I was pretty confident it was the LBD.
But, when my GP did the EKG and he and his Cardiologist friend decided I needed a stress test, I began to worry.
He told me there was a minor change from my last EKG that caused them to be cautious.
So, tomorrow morning at 8AM, they will pump me full of isotopes and make me walk for a while.
Hopefully, I will get to leave after that.
But there is the outside chance they will keep me for further treatment.
Eleven years ago, I had this test and I failed!
That lead to a heart catherization which came out fine.
But, signing the permission forms for that catherization was frightening!!
I had to sign a form for the catherization, a form for a stint procedure and a form for open heart surgery!
I asked the Doctor when the open heart surgery would happen and he said; "Right then!"
That scared me to the point of passing out!
They might be cracking me open like a crab!!
Not a comfortable mental picture for me.
Now, I am facing tha again, with even more symptoms, and I am not comfortable or at ease about tomorrow.
But,  I will be there bright and early, ready to be poked, prodded, and exercised.
Hopefully, all will be good again.

OK, I went off course on my last post.
I was going to talk about the anger issues.
Like last year at our Seniors apartment.
We had returned form a shopping trip and we had numerous bags of food to take up to our third floor apartment.
No problem, we had a cart in the garage that handled the bags well and there was the elevator.
When I pushed the elevator button, nothing happened.
No lights, no sound of the elevator moving to the ground floor.
Nothing!
I thought the elevator was out of commissioned.
I was frustrated but I also understand that mechanical things break.
Just the same, it WAS working when we left because we rode the elevator down.
So, I started carrying the groceries up the three flights of steps and then I noticed the elevator stopped on the second floor, door open, and full of furniture.
Someone was moving into a second floor apartment.
I said to the young men moving the furniture;  Move the furniture out of the elevator so other people can use it.
The sarcastically said; "No, it's OUR elevator!"
I BLEW UP!!
I mean really BLEW UP.
I was ready to fight, I was screaming at the top of my lungs using language that would have won me the World's Swearing Championship!
People in the next building, behind closed doors, heard me.
I know, they told me!
Then, after challenging them all to a fight, I went over and exploded on the management staff!!
It was ugly.
After I returned home and calmed down, I knew I had to apologize to everyone and anyone I offended.
I did so, even to the sarcastic young fellows.
I was embarased and my wife was upset.
That was the first time I really understood that my "Social Filters" were broke.
LBD had taken my ability to be nice in tough times.
Something I used to pride myself in.
It has happened more recently also, but you get the idea.
In the blink of an eye, I went from happy to ready to fight!
I was not just angry at the situation, I wanted revenge!
Thank GOD for restoring my sensibility.
But I know, this will only get worse.
So, we guard against it and try to stay out of situations that may encourage rage.
But I cannt stay completely away from life, so in my daily interactions, I am sure I will once again explode.
can only pray it is controlled.
My wife is my human rock and sh understands me better than anyone else.
She should after 40 years of marriage.
Anger and rage are real issues for those of us suffering from Lewy Body Dementia.
Again, thanks to others for sharing their experiences.

I have written before how telephone calls and visits from friends are the greatest boost to my mood.
Yesterday, I received a telephone call from a friend I worked with for 20 years.
He is always upbeat, encouraging, and witty.
Yesterday's call was no different.
Now Tim is dealing with his own issues looking out for the physical and emotional well being of his Mother.
Tim and his wife have been his Mother's only family support for a long time and now, as she needs even more help, they continue to be strong and steadfast.
As we talked, Tim asked me how I was doing and I told him I was doing well and that I was getting accustomed to Florida.
Tim then verbally punched me in the nose!!
He said; "Why don't you write about being better.
You sound like you are miserable!"
Well, point well taken!
But, in my defense, when I write about being unhappy or uncomfortable about my surroundings, it is because I am!
However, in Tim's defense, I have been doing better.
I do not feel as lost here in the Panhandle of Florida.
But I will not fulfill the recall on my Garmin GPS because I am afraid to be without it!
I am beginning to make some friends in the neighborhood.
A new retired couple moved into the house across the street.
I am glad to see the because they are older than me!
My next door neighbors are a great couple and they watch over us like we were their parents.
I have also joined the local Gideon's group, so I now have a Ministry to pour my energies into.
All in all, I am doing better emotionally.
Health wise, is a different story.
My medical condition reminds me of an old joke.
A fellow walks up to me and asks;  Can you lend me a thousand dollars until my brother gets better?
I reply, what does he have?
The fellow replies, AIDS!
My memory is getting worse, any exertion reduces me to a sweating, shaking, collapsed, pile of humanity.
I have had to purchase a rolotator, ( a wheeled walker) to help me get around when I am unstable and weak.
My doctor is fairly sure it is related to my LBD, but he did an EKG and discussed my issues with a Cardiologist.
Now they want me to do a stress test, just to be sure.
So, my health continues to get worse, but I am happier in my surroundings.
The bottom line is, Florida is good and I am as good as I can be!
Thar's not a bad way to be.
Please keep those calls and visits coming!

I enjoy water parks.
I like to ride the water slides.
Not the extreme ones, like the 160 foot drop, 60 mph ones, but the gentle, or even slightly fast slides with plenty of turns and drops.
I am like a kid at the water parks and have enjoyed a number of water parks with my grandsons.
Sadly, I found out last Thursday that those days are over.
We went to a park close to us here in northern Florida.
It is a park directed at the large tourist trade.
But it was nice, clean, and well ran.
But, it was built on the side of a hill!
I have never seen so many steps just to get from one ride to another.
Not to mention climbing up to the top of the slide.
To say this place was not handicap accessible would be an understatement.
Yes, I know, handicapped people don't go to water parks.
Yeas they do!
The water park in Virginia Beach IS handicap accessible!
Not all slides, but the wave pool and other places.
Just the same, I got extremely tired in quick order and had to sit and rest the rest of our stay.
I was out of breath and weak!
No, I did not have any chest pain.
I was just winded and weak.
When I got home, I could hardly walk and I had great difficulty getting out of my chair!
Now, being totally truthful, my legs and arms have been experiencing stiffness, pain, and rigidity, for the last few weeks.
But, these last few days, I have had to depend on my cane.
Of course, that makes my right arm hurt all the more.
My arms begin to shake after a short time of strain.
So yesterday, I did something I have been putting off for quite a while.
I bought a rotilator, or as some call it a walker with wheels.
It is easier on my arms and gives me better support.
Additionally, it has a seat and it has a storage compartment under the seat!!
The wheels are larger than most so it will navigate gravel and rough terrain.
OK, not an off road vehicle but more usable than a smooth tile floor model!
This is just another expected step in the progression of my disease.
Yes, I expected it, but I did not welcome it.
But, it is what it is.
By the way, my legs are still sore and stiff, now two days after the water park.
SO, the cane and walker are still in service.
While I was in the store purchasing my walker, I looked at the chairs that help you get up.
I think that will be my next purchase.

I have finally decided that I have reached the point that I no longer will take or tolerate anymore medical tests!
The last test where they shoved a garden hose down my nose to see if my swallower was working right was the final straw.
And believe me, the thing was much bigger than a straw, even a soda straw!!
But there are other tests I have decided not to have.
For instance, a colonoscopy.
No don't get me wrong.
I believe strongly in colonoscopies as a preventative test.
A tumor found early, polyps removed early, can extend your life.
Please get the base line colonoscopy when your doctor says to.
But, I have had half of my colon removed due to a tumor found in my baseline colonoscopy when I was 50.
And I have had a number of colonoscopies since then.
But no more.
It is just time to say, this far and no farther.
On the advice of my neurologist, only emergency surgery is recommended.
So why do these intrusive, uncomfortable tests.
Not to mention the money spent for the tests.
It is time for me to take charge of my medical issues and treatment.
I don't recommend my stance for anyone else.
But it is the right choice for me.

I believe I have written about the possibility of me getting the surgery to solve my Gastro-Intestinal Reflux Disease (GERD).
I have taken Proton Pump Inhibitors for 30 years!
They work but I would and my wife would like me off of the meds.
They have some side effects.
I had the first test, and it was a doosey!
The ran some type of device through my nose and into my throat to test the closing of my esophagus valves.
I now know why they wanted my stomach empty!
I gaged, did the dry heaves, and in general spent 20 minutes in misery!!
Then, during a normally scheduled appointment with my neurologist, I asked him if having this surgery, which requires General Anesthesia, was advisable.
He said, NO.
He also said, all elective surgeries were out.
Emergency surgery is OK.  Nice to know.
So, today, I called the doctor's office that was planning other tests and the pending surgery and told them I would not be having the surgery or other tests.
They sounded disappointed!
I guess they had a new car or an extension on their homes planned!
The neurologist said that general anesthesia has a high possibility of making dementia worse.
In other words, it may speed the progression of the disease by a jump!
He said he had seen it numerous times and really recommended against it.
So, the moral of the story for us with Dementia is, emergency surgery only!

I have written about anger, especially my anger, in the past.
I wrote about the time I lost my temper, BIG, at our previous apartments.
NO, we DID NOT move to Florida at the request of the apartment management!
(ha ha)  Just the same, anger out of frustration and self pity is a problem.
Now there is a revealing statement.
I am frustrated over the way I am treated by the medical world, the Veterans Administration, other people.
It frustrates me when people who do not know me and have no reference point as to where I was mentally or physically, tell me, I am fine or that I don't appear to be sick!
I do have a diminished self because I cannot do or remember the things I used to.
I feel less of a man because I fall of ladders, get exhausted mowing a small yard, or get completely incoherent in a store.
But most of all, I hurt, mentally, inside, continuously.
Some of the medical professionals call this depression, but that is not it.
It is more like self loathing.
An I angry, yes.
Do I show it outwardly, no.
Why, it is just not a good idea.
So, I hold my anger inside, control it, subdue it.
I have told you before, for some reason, I cannot cry.
I have had that issue since just before my diagnosis.
I believe it is related to LBD just like acting out my dreams is.
Another issue is communicating with others.
I find it increasingly difficult to discuss my symptoms and their progression with anyone.
The doctors don't care and others just glaze over and ignore me.
Some want to tell me they have the same symptoms!
That really aggravates me!
If you have these issues, go through the pain of getting a diagnosis of your own.
Other wise, quit diminishing my disease by telling me my symptoms are no worse that yours and you are normal!
I am not normal, I have Lewy Body Dementia, and I am tired of having to prove it all the time.
Since I was a small boy, I have known I was color blind.
Not totally, just what they call a color deficiency.
Every time I would tell some one that, they would give me a color test!
"What color is my shirt?"
They did not believe I was color blind even though the medical community said I was.
Their opinion was, you can walk, talk, function in society, you CAN'T be color blind!
It's the same invisibility I suffer with LBD!
However, my anger must be controlled for my well being and the well being of my wife.
Sh has been the one true supporter and cheerleader through all this.
Regardless of how the medical professionals treat me of better yet, ignore me, I must remain in control.
SO, since you are my only support group; is this an issue with any of you or those you care for?
</doc>
<doc date=Wednesday, June 13, 2012>
Yesterday, I had my latest visit to my new neurologist.
I am beginning to think that if the Neurologist did not diagnose you with LBD, they don't believe you are sick.
That coupled with his attitude of, the drugs work, sort of, so what are you complaining about, lead me to believe I would be better getting my drugs from a corner Unlicensed Pharmaceutical Salesman!
Honestly, do these people understand what compassion, care, and concern are as it applies to their patients?
I have honestly had my fill.
On another note, I did get some, offhand advice from this quack.
I was considering having the reflux disease surgery done.
I have been on Nexium and it's relatives for 30 years!
I really would like to stop taking that pill.
I seems that maybe the surgery has a good track record.
I have seen the surgeon that does this surgery here and I am undergoing the preliminary tests.
So, I asked my Neurologist if General Anesthesia is a good idea for me.
He acted like I was asking him the meaning of Life!!
But, with some prompting, he finally said, elective surgery is not a good idea because it MIGHT cause me to go further into dementia.
He actually said he has seen this in other patients.
His attitude was; "Other Patients that are really sick", but that's my read of his attitude.
So, in any case, I probably won't have the surgery.
However, my wife wants me to complete the testing, just in case it reveals that this is more than elective surgery.
I agree with her.
I had the first teat today.
They ran a tube with sensors in it down my nose, into my throat to measure the closing of my lower valve in my esophagus.
Boy, was that a terrible event!
The tube, through my nose, down my throat, caused me to gag, dry heave, and choke, all at once.
I finally settled down and completed the test.
No wonder they wanted my stomach empty.
They knew what was going to happen.
In any case, that is a test I won't have again!
So, the medical profession continues to depress me.
All that schooling and they have the personality of a bent shit can!

Today, my wife went to do water aerobics and left me at home.
I enjoy these brief periods alone.
Well, alone with my constant companion, my miniature poodle named Marcel.
I any case, I was thinking, reflecting, accessing, and in general, doing a mental inventory of where I am.
I quickly slipped into a quiet mood.
I was comfortable, not worried or threatened, and also not particularly connected to the world around me.
My mind was on my Navy days and I was happy.
When Marcel let me know that my wife was home, I was jarred back into the present.
I had to interact with her.
I had to answer and ask questions, pay attention to her replies, and help her with packages.
While it is an effort for me to be engaged with people, I believe it is good for me.
I believe that, without that human contact, I would quickly slip into a malaise that would overcome me.
Just the same, I enjoy the quiet of being alone and I enjoy being in that comfortable place in my mind.
So you see, it is my interface with people that keeps my dementia at bay.
That and all the drugs I take.
But, I did read an article on the Lewy Body Dementia website that the Alzheimer's drugs, Namenda and Arercept, taken early in the disease, have a great effect for a longer period of time.
So, people and medicines keep me going.
More to come.

<doc date=Sunday, June 3, 2012>
My wonderful wife built my blogs for me and encouraged me to write about my experiences with Lewy Body Dementia and my Nay career.
My neurologist agreed that this was a good exercise for my brain.
I enjoy writing about what is going on in my brain.
I have also gained a large support group from other bloggers in the LBD community.
I read many of their posts and have learned that many of you are going through many of the things that I am going through.
I recently read a blog about the feelings of a husband with LBD as written from the wife/care giver's view point.
This blog is such a strength and help to me.
Recently, I read about her husbands feeling and fear of leaving or her getting rid of him.
As I read that blog, I thought, I have had those feelings too.
Not directly, my wife wanting to get rid of me.
But more the idea of being such a burden that I can't see anyone wanting to be around me.
Now, let me first say, logically, I know my wife will never feel that way.
But, in the hollows of my dementia, when I am not totally connected to reality, especially at night, I get lost in my own insecurities.
I really belie e that is what many of us experiencing the uncertainties of dementia go through.
We are insecure!
The way of life that we lived, built, dreamed of is now slipping from our fingers and we can't stop it!!
Like I wrote earlier about feeling lost in the gun store, a place I normally feel completely at home in, I am insecure in many situations in my life.
Driving is becoming a challenge.
I can't drive as long as I used to.
And as a man, I think it is my job to do the driving.
The reality is, I really need to let that go.
There are other issues too.
Again, I have written about my fear of dealing with the everyday budget issues.
When my wife starts to talk budget, I have a fight of flight reaction!
That's not normal for me, but it is what it is.
The fact is, I am so insecure in my own abilities that I retreat into my own  mental happy place.
When I can sleep, sleep is my friend.
So, while I am logically sure my world will remain as close to the same as it can, I am constantly reminded of the changes, my own mental and physical changes, and where all this will lead me and my wife.
This is a difficult topic for me to open up about.
Yet, that is what this blog is supposed to be about.
So, thanks to my other blog support group members.
You are a great help.
And thanks to my wife and family.
I know you are going through even more grief and worry than I am.
But, with GOD's help, we will get through this.

I admit that I write a lot about how LBD effects me.
But I don't think I have ever written about the effects of LBD on my wife.
There is the obvious issues that effect a full time caregiver.
I must admit I am not always the most cooperative patient!
For instance, I don't like to drink water!
Coffee, beer, even soda, but not water.
She on the other hand, knows the health benefits of water.
But, I resist because I don't like the taste of water.
There are other worries, like me wandering, or me over exerting myself, or my excessive picking of my fingers.
But there are other issues I just never thought about, until now.
We are best friends and enjoy spending time together.
Now, I am not as engaged as I once was.
I loose track of conversations, get lost in my replies, and loose the ability to express myself because I loose words.
I have fears and get angry when I make a mistake doing what I always did before.
And I also have great fear discussing the budget and really do not like the mention of money, budgets, or future plans at all!
So, she has really lost her partner in these areas.
Now I am not always lost in my responses of angry.
But these issues are happening more and more.
I see her worry in the way she treats me and how she cares for me.
But I also sense her frustration.
I understand that frustration.
However, try as I may, I really can't help her with her frustration or her worry.
So, in many ways, she is alone also.
Our son helps, but he is facing his own issues.
So, as the patient, I must understand how my disease effects her.
Maybe I should be more in tune to that in the future.

Today, we went to the movies with my son and one of my grandsons.
My wife went to hold our seats in the theater while I waited for our son to show up.
When he arrived, we went to theater 3 where the movie was to view.
My wife was not there.
We searched the entire facility, twice.
Still no wife.
On the third search, I found her in another theater.
Naturally I was worried and agitated over the issue.
The movie stunk!!
When we arrived home I made coffee as is my norm.
Then I went to the bathroom and changed clothes.
As my wife returned to the kitchen, she noticed that I had not placed the coffee carafe under the filter basket and coffee was running into the tray we have set up for this eventuality.
It worked, it captured the coffee.
But I was very upset!!
Why, because anything I mess up because I forget to do a step that was once automatic, upsets me.
I immediately burst out with; "People need to realize I am not normal like I was!!"
Of course my wife understands that and it was my frustration coming out.
After that, I took a nap to calm down.
The truth is, it deeply frustrates me to see the decline in my mental capabilities.
You may say, what's the big deal, I do the same thing.
Well, I didn't!
But it is more than the coffee.
It is the problems expressing myself verbally, the constant pain in my legs and arms, and everything else I have written about before.
I am getting agitated just writing about it.
I am loosing control of my emotions and loosing control of the environment that I live in.
Having always been the "Man in Charge", this is the most frustrating and maddening part of this disease.
So, things progress, even if I don't like it!

On my Navy Blog, "The Master Chief's Lair" I have written about my family situation and my my parents who raised me.
I really had an idea situation growing up.
My Mom and Dad loved me and nurtured me and I am who I am because of the foundation they built.
GOD blessed me with my parents.
I was also blessed to have my biological Mother in my life.
She also loved me and did her best in every way.
I have said it before and I will repeat myself here;  My Mother was a very brave woman, carrying a child out of wedlock to term.
In 1951, that was not accepted in polite society and most women who found themselves in this condition were "sent away" until after the birth.
Her bravery gave me life.
She could have just as easily killed me!
I am proud of her and her courage.
All this being said, there is one issue that makes me feel empty, unwanted, and incomplete.
That is the lack of connection to my biological Father and his family.
Yes, I know that I represent his actions that he would have rather forgot.
But, I am not forgot, I am here and 61 years old.
Since I was diagnosed with LBD, the need to contact my "other" family has grown even stronger.
I did talk to my biological Father twice before he died.
But he was not happy to hear from me.
He died in the 1990's as did my Mother.
My biological Father had a son, born a few months after me and names the same as me, I called him once and we briefly talked, but he has rejected any contact since then.
I would dearly like to meet him.
Additionally, my biological Mother had three other children, another boy and two girls.
I do not know where any of these siblings are either.
Nor do I even know where to start finding them.
But again, I would love to meet them.
Again, I was blessed to be raised, loved, nurtured by my Parents.
Since this is Mother's Day weekend, it is fitting that I honor my Mom for the sacrifices she made for me.
I still hear her voice, listen to her lessons, and remember her loving touch, even though she passed away in 1976.
Mom was very special and I love her, even more today.
But, I would love to complete the circle by meeting my other siblings.
I guess that is my wish.

Even though I have Lewy Body Dementia, I am blessed to still be able to express myself, and I do through this blog.
I will admit that I am having increasing issues expressing myself verbally because I loose my thoughts and can't find the words.
But, when I get a thought chain going, I seem to be able to get my thoughts expressed through my computer.
Of course, if it were not for spell check, you would not recognize my thoughts as English!
Technology is great.
My wife and I have looked at numerous Seniors apartments, continuing care communities, and assisted living apartments.
We actually lived in an "Over 55" apartment community before we moved to Florida and liked it.
My wife does not feel comfortable in a Continuing Care Community and I can see her point.
She is a healthy, vibrant, independent, person and naturally feels stifled and controlled in those type of facilities.
The other serious drawback is the up front fees.
Some of these places want $300k or more up front.
Then they charge you $4000 a month to live there!
Expensive by any measure.
Just the same, I feel secure, safe, and provided for in a facility that would see to my needs no matter what medical or mental issues occur.
I never had this need for security until recently.
My dream was always to live on 20 or more acres and be a survivalist!
A small house, wind turbines for electricity, grow my own vegetables, wood heat, you get the idea.
Now I would rather have a small room with 24 hour care!
My security dream has changed indeed.
We have come to a decision on this topic that I hope works.
Some time ago, I don't remember exactly when, we visited the Armed Forces Retirement Home in Gulfport Mississippi.
It is a beautiful facility and I immediately fell in love.
While my wife cannot live there, she can visit and I can go out anywhere we want.
We will move her to an apartment or condo close to the "Old Sailors Home" when, and if, I get my move in date.
The cost is very manageable and if I qualify, that's where I want to be.
Of course, they have to accept me with my present diagnosis.
The rule is you must be self-sufficient when you move in.
There is a two year waiting list right now, but I have applied.
So, we will see what this brings.
Again, I am blessed to be able to express myself.
If you have been diagnosed with LBD, let you desires and wishes for future care be known while you still can.
Don't play Ostrich and stick your head in the sand!
Make plans and do research while you still have an input.
Maybe staying home, with assistance is OK with you.
Maybe not!
But planning is the key to a smooth transition through the stages of our disease.
While I write less now than before, I will continue to express myself and describe the issues I face in my journey.
It helps me and I pray it benefits others.
Thanks.

Anger management is an issue for everyone, regardless of health status, age, or sex.
We all struggle with controlling our tempers.
Just look at a two year old when things don't go their way!
It is not pretty when they melt down.
Or look at a teenager who steps over the agreed upon house rules and gets punished for it.
You would think they just got condemned to prison, for life!
So, you may now understand how I have issues controlling my emotions all of the time.
Remember, the neurologist has explained to me that the social filter portion of my brain, and the brain of many dementia sufferers, is degrading and will someday quit working all together.
Right now, I am, for the most part, able to control my emotions.
Sometimes that is through a process called POUTING!
Yes, I pout if pouting is being quiet and refusing to speak.
That is a way that I can keep my emotions in tact and in turn, not hurt someone else's feelings.
It may make some people uncomfortable, but it works.
I have also written before about my loss of the ability to cry.
It happened before I had a definitive diagnosis of LBD.
But, regardless of when it came to be, I seldom cry and only in the most dire circumstances.
This is a problem because I cannot vent those emotions that get trapped inside of me.
Since I know this, I have to find other ways to deal with my emotions.
My wife is very good at managing most circumstances and is very in tune with my feelings.
So, with her help, most issues are defused or averted.
When we lived in Virginia Beach, in our over 55 apartment, I had an outburst over some folks moving into an apartment.
They commandeered the elevator and I had some packages I needed to move up to our apartment on the third flood.
The people were pretty rude about it and I exploded!
I gave them a wire rushing, the apartment management, and the movers, again!!
Of course, after I calmed down, I apologized.
But, it was ugly.
Just the same, I know there will be a day when I explode, profanity and all.
And I hope that everyone will understand that.
I try to take into consideration, every one's emotions.
I don't want to hurt my family or friends.
But sometimes, that desire seems to not be there and all I can see is that thing I am angry with.
You can see, how not having that "People" filter is a bad thing.
Again, having a care giver who understands this problem is essential to my mental health and the emotions of others.
I once saw a fellow who, without provocation, exploded in profanity at everyone and anyone around him.
He was loud, abusive, and foul!
I did not understand why, until recently.
Now I understand and I hope others will too.

Today we heard of the tragic apparent suicide of NFL super star Junior Seau.
Some of the reports I have read tell of Mr. Seau being depressed and talk about the possibility of hi having dementia related to his NFL career.
Additionally, other NFL players have recently committed suicide recently.
And they were diagnosed with dementia.
Now, it has already bee proven that repeated head injuries, as one would experience during a career as an NFL player.
So the idea that Mr. Seau might have dementia caused by his career is not a far stretch.
But the real topic of this post is suicide.
When someone is diagnosed with a terminal disease, they go through all the steps of grief, at once!
And I can understand while someone is is deep in the throws of "Why Me".
While they are contemplating just how terrible the future may be, they might experience the desire to "end it all now" instead of going through the torture that may be ahead.
But suicide is NOT the way out!
Why?
In my view, I can only terminate what I have initiated!
I can trade a car if I bought the car.
I can sell a house, if I bought the house.
But, I did not GIVE myself LIFE!
GOD did.
Therefore, I do not have the right to kill myself.
Life is a precious gift.
It is wonderful and wondrous!
In the Book of Psalms we are told that we are "wondrously made in our Mother's womb".
Psalm 139 also tells us that; "All the days of our life are written in GOD's book before we are formed in our Mother's womb."
If GOD made us and planned our life, I do not have the right to take my life.
Also, if GOD know all that will happen in my life, then HE is not surprised about my medical condition.
If then, my condition was planned, then GOD has a plan for me to live with this disease or diseases, for as long as I am scheduled to live!
I wrote once before that LBD will not shorten my life.
I will live as long as GOD originally planned for me to live.
Not one day longer or shorter than that.
My Dad used to tell me, on the back of your Birth Certificate is your Death Certificate.
But the Death Certificate is written in invisible ink.
He was right!
And that is what I will live by.

We have been in Florida for six months and for the most part, it has been good.
The family time is great!
The winter was warm and I seem to be getting acclimated to the area.
But Florida has it's own issues too.
When I used to talk about moving to Florida, before my son and his family moved here, my wife would rattle off a list of negative issues about living in Florida.
Bugs as big as cats, snakes, BIG snakes, sink holes, hurricanes, are just the beginning of the list.
Of course, when the grand sons moved here, we moved.
Yesterday we spent around the pool at my sons house.
We came home about 8PM.
As we drove home, we noticed swarms of bugs in the air!
When we got home, one of my neighbor's garage door would not close because the swarming bugs were blocking the safety sensors!
WHen we got home, in the garage, our door would not successfully close in power either.
I looked at the bugs and I thought they were flying ants.
Then we went into the house and noticed hundreds of these bugs crawling all over.
On the wall in our bedroom, there were bugs boring holes in the dry wall!
They were termites!!
I called the company I have the pest contract with, an absolute requirement in Florida, and they came out today.
We have Formosa Termites!
I can't get normal north American termites.
I have to get the exotic types!
The pest control folks are taking care of convincing the termites to move some where else!
Florida, not just a state, it's an adventure!

A few new issues have surfaced that I wish to bounce off of you, the readers and care takers.
One is an issue I have written about before, my blood pressure.
It has been running consistently high.
My GP had me purchase a good, automatic, blood pressure machine to take readings daily.
Either that machine is reading high or I am about to pop a gasket!
Sometimes I feel like my head is pressurized and other times I feel normal.
Another issue that may be associated with blood pressure is that I have very low energy levels and I get exhausted doing the easiest tasks.
Tonight I moved the sprinkler hose and actually got winded.
On the other hand, I can walk with my wife for 30-45 minutes with no ill effects.
So, I don't know what is going on.
The GP seems to think I am OK for now.
At least he did not seemed too concerned when I saw hi last week.
SO, I guess we will just wait and watch.
But, if anyone has similar issues, please let me know.
You are my support group!
Thanks.

I have observed individuals suffering from numerous diseases over my life.
Recently, with my own diagnosis of LBD I have observed other individuals with dementia related diseases and most of them share one issue, they had no planning for their future.
Yes, I know that no one thinks they will have a terminal disease when they are young.
As a young person, we consider ourselves "Bullet Proof"!
But as we age, we find out we are not.
But planning is your best friend for the future.
Purchasing long term care insurance when you are young ensures the cost is lower and the coverage is better.
Saving for future retirement early will allow your interest to compound and your investment to multiply many times over.
These are concepts we all hear about but pay little attention to.
We would rather drive that Corvette, have the big house, or take that vacation to Tahiti.
But those luxuries will not be there when you need cafe in your senior years.
My wife and I have toured many Continuing Care Communities and attended many Senior Health Fairs in order to learn more about our options.
We have also attended Alzheimer's Association's events and have gained a wealth of information from that wonderful organization.
Your city may have a senior services bureau like Virginia Beach does.
All of these resources help you plan your future.
But the best information I can offer you is to Learn, plan and act on your future.
Some people question us about our proactive approach to our future living conditions.
They would rather react to the circumstances of life that being as prepared as they can be.
But trust me, it is hard to get insurance after the doctor tells you that you have a terminal condition.
It is like trying to get car insurance to cove an accident you have already been involved in!
So, plan ahead, as far as you can.
Another area of importance is Elder Law.
Who will make medical decisions for you if you are incapacitated?
Who will handle your financial matters if you cannot.
These are big issues when the individual is medically incapacitated.
Some people tell me; "My wife will do it."
Maybe, but in some states selling houses requires a power of attorney specifically stating the sale of real estate.
Again, do your research BEFORE you need this help.
Contact the Alzheimer's Association for more information.
Lastly, discuss this information with you family.
Let them know your wishes while you can and get them written down in a legal document.
DO your research and protect your rights as well as your family's rights.

I realize more than anyone what I am going through with my LBD and the other medical issues that have came along like my Hypothyroidism, a little bit of asthma and allergies, hearing loss from my Navy days, a constant ringing in my ears from the Navy, my skin condition from the hydraulic fluid in the Navy and other minor issues.
I am not complaining, just stating the facts as they are.
I am also still dealing with the emotions of having a degenerative neurological disease.
I have not fully dealt with this issue, as my past neurologist informed me and I am in agreement, finally.
I am also dealing with the emotional shock of moving from Virginia Beach to Florida.
Not that I don't like being with my family.
I do!
But I am away from everything I was used to!
All my friends, the Navy, my Church family, my Church duties, and all that I knew for almost 30 years.
I can't get anywhere here.
I am lost when I leave the house, just near.
And I have not found a friend in the six months I have been here.
No Navy friends to talk too, no shooting friends, and no where to shoot!
Hell,  might as well take up knitting!
I always read the obituaries from the Tidewater area.
Last week, the second Admiral that I worked for at SURFLANT passed away.
He was 80.
Admiral Donnell lived a full life but his death still hit me like a ton of bricks.
I was thinking about calling him recently.
I wish I had.
We had been in contact through my Civil Service career after we both left the Navy.
He was always supportive of me and I appreciated him.
Of late, I have been feeling like something has been taken from me.
I have a sense of loss.
I feel like I am drained and without energy and interest.
This overwhelming emotion is beginning to consume me.
Yes, my Wife and I go places.
Any where she wants to!
Truthfully, if she did not want to go out, I would stay home!
There is no where I want to go.
Today, my Grandson and his friend mowed my lawn.
My Grandson's and Son and Daughter in Law are always helping me.
I got to take a couple of turns on the riding mower, but they did the majority of the work including the trimming.
My wife makes sure I don't do too much or get over tired.
She follows Doctor Dowdy's instructions to me.
After the boys were done, we took them back to the house and we had a moment to visit with my Daughter in law who has recently had a heart attack.
She is doing well but is still dealing with the recovery process.
Of course, this event came as a total shock to me and has served to add to my emotional state.
The bottom line is, I put on a brave face, stand tall, and act tough.
But on the inside I m falling apart.
When I am alone with my thoughts, I suffer from this overwhelming feeling of loss and despair.
I used to make it through cruises by projecting my thoughts to the end of the cruise.
In doing this, the events of the day, the stress of doing my job on a Navy ship, seemed to speed by.
Now, I cannot do this.
There is no "End of the Cruise" and my "Home Coming" will be when I go home to be with the Lord!

Last night was one of the nights that upset me.
We went to sleep fairly early after watching a movie with our youngest Grandson.
It was a wonderful evening and I did not experience any stress or upset before bed.
I went to sleep quickly, but sometime during the night I had one of those "Combat" dreams.
I don't remember the dream but I obviously had one because I hit my wife twice in a row during the night!
I hate this part of LBD.
I feel guilty about the incident even though I did not do it on purpose.
She was not hurt, thank GOD, but I am still ashamed of my actions.
My wife understands and says she is fine and all seems fine this morning.
I just spent a long time on the telephone with an old shipmate.
He asked me how I was doing, and I said, As good as I can be!
I also said, if I have to have a disease, this is not a bad one to have.
After all, I can do most of the things I want to if I pay attention to my limitations.
So, all in all, thins are good.
This post reminds me of a comedy song Alan Sherman had out in the 1960's.
It was called; "Camp Grenada" and it was about a boy at camp writing home.
He tells how bad camp is, the food, the bugs, and then, he changes his tune when the sun comes out!
That is how my days go.
I feel terrible some times until I realize just how good I have it.
Maybe I will stay at Camp Grenada for a while longer!

My wife writes an exceptional blog on her own, titled; "The Days GOD has Planned for me".
It is a well written, thoughtful, insightful blog about life, our life.
Today she wrote an article about our struggles with my LBD.
It is mandatory reading as far as I am concerned.
Please try her blog also.
You won't be disappointed.

Well, after a couple of telephone calls to my neurologist and a reduction in the dose to one-half a tablet, I think we are on the right path.
I took the reduced dose for 6 days and I had no headaches.
So, today I upped the dosage to one pill.
This is where I was supposed to start.
I have also changed my dosage time to first thing in the morning instead of at night, just before bed.
I also think this is part of the beneficial effect.
My plan is, to take one tablet for a week, then increase to one and a half.
Finally getting to the two pills dosage in a couple of weeks.
This is slower than the neurologist wanted but I think I will tolerate it better.
Since I take so many meds, my body is just about at it's limit, in my opinion.
Yes, I know I  did not go to medical school, but I do know how my body reacts.
The one thing I am a bit aggravated about is the slow speed that my new neurologists office replied.
Again, I know they are busy, but when I call with one of the "Serious" contra-indications of the medicine as outlined on the sheet the Pharmacy gave us, I would expect the doctor to reply to me in an expeditious manner!!
Just my opinion.

<doc date=Monday, March 19, 2012>
My last post discussed the fact that my new neurologist did a blood test that lead him to believe I have a thyroid gland tat is not putting out as much, what ever it puts out, as it should.
His answer was a medicine, a pill, that would solve my problem!
Sounds reasonable.
I even checked on WEBMD and they agreed.
He started me on one half the dose and I was supposed to take that for two weeks to get used to the medicine.
The first couple of days went OK, but a couple of days ago, I developed a headache.
Not the run of the mill headache, but the kind you get after drinking too much, for a week!
It is a migraine, vascular, whopper of a headache and Excedrin does not phase it.
We called the neurologist and left a message but have not received a reply.
He is probably golfing!
So, I intend to cut the dosage to half a pill and see if that helps me get rid of this air hammer in my head!
Until then, I will sit here in the quiet.
</doc>
<doc date=Tuesday, March 13, 2012>
I have spent the last 36 hours thinking about the results of the blood tests the new neurologist ordered.
My wife and I, along with WEBMD, can trace the hypothyroidism symptoms back 9 months.
That's important, because I can now say that while I have hypothyroidism, I still have Lewy Body Dementia!
That statement is important to me because, like so many LBD sufferers, I have been questioned and doubted too many times.
Too many doctors, acquaintances, and health professionals, have said; "You are not sick, I have those symptoms sometimes, you don't look sick, that's not a disease."
So, I am sensitive about being called a malingerer and a gold brick.
It is not out of the question for an individual in declining health to suffer from numerous issues.
If someone has congestive heart failure and Asthma, no one would blink an eye.
So why is it, that some folks would question me on my LBD diagnosis along with the hypothyroidism diagnosis?
But, because of how I have been treated, it has taken me these 36 or so hours to come to this conclusion.
Tonight is the first time I will take the prescribed medicine for my hypothyroidism.
We will see how I do on this medicine.
Hopefully, I will tolerate it well because I really would like to get this issue under control.
For the last few months, I have really felt terribly tired, weak, lethargic, and just lousy .
I would like to get back to feeling just bad!

Well, we had our second visit to the new neurologist.
After waiting for longer than I wanted to, we saw the doctor.
He went right to his briefing on all the tests he did on me.
He said I have mild sleep apnea,  I have a severe memory loss, my muscle enzymes are up, I have a vitamin D deficiency and I have hypo-thyroidism.
That came as a surprise.
But, after the appointment, we did some time line construction and we determined that I started to gain weight about 9 months ago.
I am up 30 pounds!
I also can trace my tiredness, my increased memory issues, my leg muscle pain, and the fact that I am either too cold or sweating severely, to that period.
So, this may have came on recently.
In any case, this means more pills!
But it may be a positive turn of events because I may see an improvement in my memory and the leg pains may decrease.
Also, my energy levels may increase and that would be good.
I could also loose some weight and I need that to help the mild sleep apnea.
It's all tied together it seems.
My wife is frustrated with the constant change of diagnosis and prognosis.
Each doctor has their own idea and since dementia issues cannot be definitively diagnosed, it will always be this issue of the day every time we go to the neurologist.
At least he is not telling me I don't have LBD or that I am not sick.
One other test they ran was the cognitive skills test.
He said I had no memory!
But I knew that.
I really tried on that test, but, it gave me the results that I expected.
So, tomorrow I will start a new set of pills and we shall see if he has this one right!

One of the hardest parts of moving to Florida has been leaving my best friends behind.
That coupled with the complete absence of surface ship sailors to converse with leaves me without anyone to talk too.
Yes, I have folks I talk to, but they know little or nothing about the surface Navy and therefore, we have little in common.
But last Tuesday, my best friends came to visit and it was grand!
We pushed ourselves to the limit, staying up late, not taking naps, and going more places in three days than I would normally go in a week.
But it was wonderful.
They were the first visitors we have had in the new Florida home.
I enjoy visitors, they invigorate me and make me push my limits.
We talked Navy, politics, old times, and old friends.
I felt good.
It all ended too quickly but work and distance always win.
Now I am starting to plan our trip back to Virginia.
</doc>
<doc date=Saturday, March 3, 2012>
I have been on this road for a few years now.
And, much like the kids in the back seat of the car during a family car trip, I have asked way to many times; are we there yet?
Well, it appears to me that I am there, now.
I feel disconnected and distant in my mind.
I get tired easily, I am moody, grumpy, and I don't want to do anything.
But the one thing that is driving everything is the feeling of being mentally lost.
I know where I am, but I am lost within my mind,  My memories are lost or scrambled much of the time.
I have great difficulty putting sentences together.
Thank Microsoft and my wife for spell check or you could not read my thoughts.
Anything mental is becoming more of a challenge.
I loose track of what I am doing easily, can't recall facts that used to spill out of my mouth, and it is frustrating to me.
Another issue with LBD is the automatic functions of your brain get confused.
Like my blood pressure.
One time it is 110/60 the next time it is 140/100.
My new GP got really worried the last time he took my BP.
Wanted to jump into BP meds.
I told him to calm down.
Also, I am experiencing involuntary muscle movements that I cannot control in my legs and now my arms.
Right now it is just an annoyance, but it is a further degradation of my brain functions.
I guess I am just frustrated with my mental state.
I see the loss of mental function and I now know I am there, now.

Don and I were discussing his Lewy Body this morning and connecting with any issues and feelings that we had on our minds.
As we talked I mentioned something that Don wants me to try to explain to you all who read this Blog.
One of the difficulties with Lewy Body is the secretiveness that occurs.
The sufferer feels unable to connect with people that do not have the disease and often keeps to themselves how the disease is affecting them on the inside.
It is almost impossible to bridge the gap and understand their feelings and how our reactions to their feelings affect them.
They feel alienated and it becomes a vicious circle of alienation, more secretive, more paranoia, more alienation, etc.
An analogy is how society helps/hinders a person with a physical disease or disability versus how society helps/hinders a person with a mental disease such as Lewy Body.
If a person were in a wheel chair and needed to make a call and the nearest phone was up 2 flights of stairs the person in the wheel chair would not be expected to be able to make that call without assistance.
Either an elevator would be installed, or phones available on the first floor, or an attendant would be available for assistance.
Society understands that their part in the scenario would be to provide a way for the disabled person to function as fully as possible in an abled society.
What society in general doesn't understand with a person with Lewy Body or other brain disorders is that the sufferer IS in a wheel chair - it just isn't a physical wheel chair.
It is a wheel-chair that surrounds the mind and creates the same barriers as the physical wheel-chair does to the physically disabled person.
A person with Lewy Body loses the ability to sequence the steps of decision making, gets overwhelmed with the process of seeking help and then tries to hide from people the fact that they can't initiate the process of finding help for a problem they are having.
The phone that they would need to use might as well be up 2 flights of stairs because they can't understand the process of how to ask for help.
The difference between the way society acts is this: Of the physically disabled they would think:  you are in a wheel chair I know you can't get up the steps let me help.
Of the mentally disabled: there's a phone not three feet away why don't you get off your butt and use it?
The physically disabled know how to use the phone they just can't get to it.
The mentally disabled can get to the phone they just don't know how to use it.
When we joined a support group for Alzheimer's sufferers we thought it would be a way for Don to get to know other sufferers and to share stories of how they were coping.
That never happened.
It was a frustrating time for Don and we finally quit going.
We couldn't figure out why it didn't work until our talk this morning.
Early and mid stage Alzheimers and Lewy Body dementia patients don't talk about how they feel inside.
They don't open up about how they fear confrontation, how mentioning the budget sends panic their way, how they feel alone and afraid.
They instead talk about what the facilitators bring up, or how they bemoan the fact that they can't drive anymore.
They talk about safe, victim status issues that the facilitators and society seem to understand.
The issues of feeling helpless to initiate a decision-making process, the feeling of paranoia that people are plotting against them, the feeling of having to be secretive because people aren't interested or can't possibly understand how they feel inside.
They don't or can't tell others of all the emotional and mental turmoil that is roiling around inside.
Alzheimer's and dementia are often called by caregivers as the disease with the long good-bye.
That's our take on it.
But as I see and now understand more for the sufferer it is a disease of a long erosion and the feeling of sliding into a bottomless black pit.
No wonder the Alzheimer's support group didn't work for the sufferers.
How can victims of this mind erosion all of whom are in various stages of the disease possibly communicate their frustrations to others who are feeling the same feelings but don't know how to express them?
The caregivers portion of the groups are great.
We also share the understandable things of the disease.
When did you take away their driver's license?
Does your spouse make a mess in the kitchen like mine does?
Who do I call to provide day care, bus service, respite care, monetary help?But we don't talk about how it feels to watch a beloved spouse withdraw from you, or how it feels to watch them unable to cope with daily living.
Or how it feels to watch the rock, the center of your universe slowly slip away.
One joy I have is knowing that I can now be Don's rock.
I know that later he may not know that I am his wife, but that I will be the rock that keeps his world on an even-keel.

My neurologist in Virginia Beach cautioned me that my hallucinations would progress from my visions of small rodents running across the floor to people that I will talk to!
Turns out, she was right!
No, I have not had a conversation with one of my "Friends" yet, but my hallucinations are getting bigger and more realistic.
Yesterday, I saw a small dog, walking across the kitchen floor last night.
Now my faithful friend "Marcel" was laying closely by my side.
My wife was on the couch with us, and there was that dog, walking across the kitchen.
I looked at Marcel just to make sure it was not him, then I told my wife.
Her reply was; What does it look like?
She mentally catalogs everything I tell her.
But, she is not easily upset by my issues.
A great combination in a care giver.
So, much like the night I punched my wife because of a dream I was having, another issue surfaces in full cover.
By the way, when I told my neurologist about punching my wife, she replied; I was expecting that!
Funny, I wasn't and I am sure my wife was not either.

Well, the long avoided sleep study finally happened!
They made accommodations for my wife to stay with me, because I wake up disoriented and frightened sometimes.
They made accommodations for her, sort of.
There was a recliner for her to sleep in.
Not the best night's sleep for her.
I on the other hand, had a bed that was fairly comfortable.
The staff wired me up and I looked like the Mercury Astronauts getting ready for the first manned flight!
Tubes in my nose, wires stuck to my head with globs of something that looked and felt like Elmer's Glue, wires on my legs, my arms, my hands, my goodness, how do they expect me to sleep!
How can roll over?
How do I go to the bathroom?
But, it worked.
While I felt like I got very little sleep, my wife, who really did get very little sleep, said I slept pretty well.
I have not seen the results yet, but the technician did not come in and put a CPAP mask on me in the middle of the night, so I must have done well.
I view this a a required test.
A check in the box.
Something to suffer through.
Do I think that I have sleep apnea?
No.
But I understand the doctor needs to check all possibilities.
So, it is done, and I am glad.
I am sure they will come up with something else to do.

One of the frustrations in my life since this disease has started to progress is that I cannot fix the things that are wrong.
In the past, I have always been able to fix what was wrong.
If the faucet drips, I replace the seals, if the roof leaks, I get my friends and put on a new roof, if the car breaks down, I trouble shoot the problem and fix it, if a relationship has problems, I find the issues and provide a solution.
My wife says that's what men do.
Actually, when I said this was a frustration to me, she said; "That's what men do, fix things."
She is right, of course.
I explained to her today that I was frustrated because I have had to put her in the position of caretaker.
I know she understands, but I need the security of hearing her tell me all is OK.  That used to be my job, now, I am the one who needs consoling.
Our home Church is experiencing some difficult financial and attendance issues that we are dealing with from a distance.
We love the people of that Church and I wish I could solve the issues they are facing first hand.
Unfortunately, I am powerless and that frustrates me even more.
Yes, prayer is important, but the "Fix it Man" in me wants to be the repairman.
Of course, that's not going to happen.
So, I continue to learn how to live with the limitations of LBD.
But truthfully, I am getting tired of fighting this fight.
I am not sure i want to learn much more.
I know I will, but right now I am feeling the frustrations of coping.

We had a good day today.
We got up and had a leisurely breakfast.
My constant companion poodle got groomed.
My best friend called me and we had a great conversation discussing his and his wife's pending visit.
We went shopping for a few things and enjoyed ourselves and now, I am sitting on the couch, watching television, digesting a wonderful dinner.
I truly have it made!!
Yes, my legs hurt enough that I needed some pain meds tonight, I have problems walking too long and even standing for any period of time, and I still dream every night, things that frighten me.
And my memory continues to get worse, even old memories are fading.
But, this life is precious, I find great joy in my son and his family being so close.
I enjoy the time with my grandsons, and most of all, I love and cherish my time with my wonderful wife.
Even with all that is going on, I know that I truly have it made!!
There really is nothing that can change that fact.
And I am happy and secure in that truth.
GOD has blessed me with a wonderful life.

We spent the day getting our legal issues in order for our new home state.
It seems the law is different from state to state.
That's good!
It means States Rights and the Tenth Amendment still exist.
In any case, we met with our new Elder Law attorney to redo our medical directive, power of attorney and even our wills.
These are important issues to anyone but they are specially important to families and individuals effected with a dementia disease.
You see, at some time, probably sooner than later, I will become unable to conduct my own business or convey my wishes for end of life care.
And, since our society has become so litigation based, doctors and financial institutions are very protective of their share holders.
So they want to be sure the person telling them the wishes of the patient who is now unable to tell them himself what he wants, is actually legally permitted to do what they say they are!
Now, you say, I don't have dementia, so I don't need these documents.
You know that is not true, but you are in denial.
This visit was free and the documents we need will only cost about $400.
Now that is cheap insurance to ensure my wishes are followed, when I cannot convey them.
I have been in the hospital once since I was diagnosed and as the doctor was reviewing my medicine list, he topped talking to me and addressed all questions to my wife as soon an he saw I was taking Arecept and Namenda!!
Again, this is just one important step on the road to the future.
And being prepared is the only way to ensure your spouse, your children and you are prepared and legally protected.

I have addressed this in some detail before, but tonight I am really bothered by the staccato, jumping around, noise, activity of my wife.
Now DON'T get me wrong, my wife is a super woman!
She takes wonderful care of me and is exceptionally caring of me.
She does everything she can to make my life as smooth and pleasant as possible.
But, almost every evening, she gets this fit of activity that drives me crazy.
I can control my emotions and hold in my rage.
But, sometimes, after a time of extreme activity, when I am tired, worn out, I am extremely susceptible to the effects of this hyperactivity.
Again, I know it is not something she does on purpose, it is just the way she is wired.
But she needs to understand that my wiring is "shorted" and things that she sees as normal for her cause me great discomfort.
No, I don't discuss it with her.
I did once, that was sufficient.
I take meds at night to ease the stress, emotional discomfort, take the edge off.
But I do not think they do much because I still experience this issue almost every night.
I guess on the positive side, I can say she is consistent!
So, I will just continue to deal with this issue.
I do worry about this as an issue that will continue to get worse as I progress down the road of Lewy Body Dementia.
But, there is nothing I can do about it, now or in the future.
So why worry.

During a telephone call with my Brother yesterday, we talked about my retirement and he asked me how my wife liked retirement.
My answer was; "She thought she would miss work.
That lasted about 15 minutes."
The truth is, we are much better off, health wise, retired than in our individual careers.
The reasons are both obvious and hidden.
The obvious reasons are know to most of us.
Having our entire day together.
Being able to do what we want, when we want.
No deadlines, no projects, unless we plan them.
I often call retirement six Saturdays and one Sunday per week.
These benefits are good for our mental and physical health.
The hidden benefits are things we choose not to talk about.
For instance, my wife and I both worked in caustic, emotionally poisonous environments.
The office politics, the management bullies, the individuals that only profit if someone in the team fails.
All of these emotional stressors  combine to make going to work painful, even repulsive!
We all have experienced these issues and we justify them in our mind by telling our self; "It's this way every where."
Well, if it is, it shouldn't be.
I retired because I had reached the point in the progression of my LBD that I could no longer effectively do my job.
I could not remember how to do the basic parts of my position.
Yes, there were friends that would have carried me.
But that is not fair to them or the organization.
But, retirement has actually helped me feel better.
Retirement has extended my useful mental capabilities and made my quality of life better.
Will I live longer,  no.
But, I will live better!
I regretted retiring because I enjoyed what I did and the people I worked with.
However, after looking at the positive effects of being retired, I have to say that the ability to retire has been a great benefit to me.
The caustic effects of office politics took it's toll on me, and now I know just how much.
I often tell people, there are two things GOD is not making any more of;  Land and time!
Time, not money is the most precious thing you have,  And, since we do not know when GOD will call us home, tie is also an unknown.
There will never be enough money if we don't stop wanting and spending.
If you are diagnosed with a disease that is not curable, consider how you are going to spend that valuable time.

The sole reason we moved to Florida is because our Son and his wonderful family moved her.
I talked to my wife a number of times about a possible move to Florida and I met a mile long list of reasons NOT to move.
I even looked into The Villages!
No deal.
But, now we are Floridians.
As I said, Florida means Family.
Today, we had everyone at our house to christen my new gas grill.
I cooked chicken and did a good job.
The entire family plus a friend of our Grandsons came to enjoy the afternoon.
But the secret is, I enjoyed it even more than they did.
It is therapy for me to have people to talk with, to tell sea stories to, to listen to.
I really enjoyed myself.
And, in the next few weeks, my sister and our best friends, are coming to visit.
So, I am excited!
Another thing I really enjoy is telephone calls from friends and family.
Today, I had the opportunity to talk to my Brother.
We talked for a good long, time, and I really enjoyed it.
So, this was a good day.
I know I write about the tough issues, so I think I should talk about the good days too.
And this was a great one!
Thanks.

I was just discussing with my wife that I am tired of not feeling like myself!
I believe this is my way of starting to deal with the fact that I will never feel like I used too.
The neurologist I saw before I left Virginia said I had not yet dealt with my disease.
I strongly disagreed with her then, but maybe she was right.
Since the move to Florida, my wife and I have noticed changes for the worse in my mental and physical condition.
This disease is progressing and I know it.
Up to now, I may have been in denial like others were.
But now, it seems I may have a fight on my hands.
On another note.
I have received a number of telephone calls from friends used to work with.
Their telephone calls are great therapy for me.
I enjoy hearing their voices and discussing the issues of the day.
Politics, sports, work, their's not mine.
They seldom ask how my disease is progressing and I appreciate that.
I love to get their calls, I miss them.
So, that's the sate of me, today.
But, like a tide moving on the sand, this will change too.
I like that.
Change is good.

I was looking at my blogs this morning and I realized I had not posted in a few days.
It is not a new thing, but I loose track of time.
If you asked me, I would have said it was only yesterday that I wrote my last blog.
But, as you know, it was not.
Today, my wife is at a crafting event, so I am alone, except for my faithful companion Marcel, at home.
As it always happens, I will be totally surprised when she walks in!
And I will not have accomplished all the things I had planned.
Why, because I loose track of time.
I even know how it happens, I get distracted.
Like now, I am blogging instead of working in the garage getting it organized.
Oh well, no big deal.
On another note, I went to see my new neurologist sometime last month, I don't remember when.
He did some memory tests and blood tests.
I am anxious to see the results of those.
I don't remember what the blood test was for.
He will tell me when I see him next.
When is that, I don't know but my wife does.
She keeps me on track.
Well, back to whatever I am supposed to be doing.
Or maybe I will just watch the rain.

I love the comments, support, and love, that I receive from my blog support group.
I read every comment you send several times, and get reassurance, information, and emotional help, from each comment you write.
Like many of us, I don't take enough time to thank you for your efforts and care.
But I do appreciate your efforts to keep me informed and encouraged.
Unlike other blogs, this one is pretty intimate.
I have brought to you some sensitive issues in order to document my journey.
Each time I have bared my heart, you, my readers who mostly don't know me personally,  have offered your experiences, your encouragement, and your caring love.
So, I want to take this moment to thank you for your concerns and friendship.
You make my journey easier on me and my family.
Please keep your comments, experiences, and concerns coming.
And I will keep writing as long as I can.
Again, thank you!

Since we moved to Florida, I had to get a new Neurologist.
And, since I have a NEW Neurologist, I have to undergo a new series of Cognitive Skills tests.
The New Doctor's staff is a little COLD in their approach.
Professional, but cold, like ICE cold!
The new tests I took were completely computer based.
Past tests were done by humans and were interactive with the administrator of the tests watching my reactions, effort, and reactions.
This test administrator sat on a chair, behind me on the other side of the room.
She could not see my face or my reactions.
When I was being watched in the past, I think I tried harder.
Don't get me wrong, I tried this time too, but I still like the human interaction.
In any case, the test had the same components.
For instance, the computer gave me 15 words, and then at the end of the hour of testing, it asked me to remember the fifteen words.
I remembered three!
Then there were the 15 different shapes.
the same drill, and I think I remembered seven.
But that makes sense, I am mechanical in nature, so shapes mean more to me than words.
In any case, I will be interested to see how I did.
I will keep you posted, if I remember!

Today, we had our first visit with our new Neurologist.
I say, our NEW Neurologist, because I am going to keep him!
He is attentive, engaged, and took ownership of me!
He dd not question my diagnosis like so many others do.
But, he wants to do more testing and said there is a new "Memory" drug on the market that may help more than the Namenda and Razadyne.
He also could explain the "Dark Spot" that shows up in my brain scans.
No other Doctor could do this!
I'm impressed.
I have another set of cognitive skills tests set for this week, he did blood tests today to see if my muscle pain is related to any drugs I take, and he is working on getting me a better nights sleep.
Not bad for a first visit.
By the way, he spent an hour with me!!
Maybe, the move to Florida is good for my health in the long run!

I am not a Neurologist, a Psychiatrist, of a Psychologist, so I don't have the answer for the questions that I am going to ask.
And, if you are squeamish about bodily functions, stop reading.
Of course, if you have LBD or care for someone that does, these issues are not new to you.
Additionally, I am venturing into some new territory for my blog, and for most LBD blogs that I read.
But, that's what I do, I address what I am going through.
So, here we go!
When my father in law had Alzheimer's and lived wit us, he had a habit of picking his nose.
Not the usual, discreet, necessary, nose picking that we all do, especially at stop lights!
But the incessant nose picking, for no apparent  reason that lead to him wearing a hole in the inside of his nose.
This lead to extensive bleeding because he was prone to bleeding.
I thought maybe he was bored, or maybe not in control of his actions due to the Alzheimer's.
The doctors did not have an answer then.
But they knew little about the disease at that time.
But, I now pick at my face, hair, fingers, nose, incessantly!
I cannot stop.
My wife calls it to my attention and I stop for a minute, but then I am back at it.
My hands are an easy target due to the damage from the hydraulic fluid that I worked with in the Navy.
I also find sores other places on my body and assault them too.
I will pick until I bleed!
Then find another place.
I never seem to run out of places to pick and never find the ability to stop.
I partake in this practice every waking moment, no matter what I am doing!
You may say I am OCD, and maybe I am.
But no one has told me that.
And I don't exhibit any other "Monk" like issues.
But one thing I know for sure, I am driving my poor wife crazy!
She will look at me and I am bleeding from two or more spots that I have picked.
She tells me to stop, but I can't.
So, I ask those of you who are my electronic support group;  Do you see this in your patient?
Let me know.
I m sure we will bring it up with the new Neurologist tomorrow.
Oh joy, another Neurologist to prove my sickness too!!

I have said before how much I loved and respected my parents.
They took me in, and raised me, loved me, taught me how to succeed.
They raised me after their own children were grown, married, and had their own families.
Being raised by older parents, I had the benefit of learning from their experience.
My Mom had cancer, before all the wonderful treatment options that we have today.
The medical experts of the day did buy her five good years, but the radiation treatments that helped her, eventually killed her.
My Dad dearly loved his wife, my Mom, and was devastated by her illness.
Yet, he did not understand what she was experiencing at the end.
He used to say;  If she would just get up, eat a good meal, and walk around the block, she would feel better."
Of course, nothing could have been further from the truth, but that was what he wanted, Her BETTER!
This memory has helped me understand the people in my life.
They want me back the way I was.
They want me to be active, strong, involved, in my life and theirs.
But I can't be what I was.
I can only be what I am now.
Today, we took a walk.
A long, brisk walk.
In the past we would walk 5 miles, at a pace that most people would consider a jog.
We would take those types of walks everyday!
But now, my energy levels, my strength, my muscles, just can't do what I used to do.
So, sometime, my wife gets frustrated with me because I don't want to walk.
But it is not that I don't want to, it is that I can't.
But, now I understand, from what I observed in my parents, that, she wants me to be better, be what I was, and so, doing what we DID will make me the way I was!
Now I understand.
She loves me!
But I always knew that.

My wife and I have discovered a local pottery shop in Gulf Breeze on Florida 98.
This shop is fantastic.
They carry some very whimsical and unique Mexican pottery that we really like decorating with.
Brightly colored lizards, frogs, suns, turtles, just about anything you can imagine.
We have used these as wall art and accent pieces.
They are different, and happy!
While we were in the shop this week, the shop owner asked me to sign her log book, including my email address so she could let me know what she was finding on her upcoming trip to Mexico.
My wife was busy perusing the shop, so I obliged her.
I did the best I could printing the required information.
The shop owner commented on how good my penmanship was and my wife looked surprised.
I had done my very best and it looked like very good third grader printing.
I know that, but it is the best I can do.
As my LBD has progressed, my hand writing has gone down hill.
My wife, who has beautiful hand writing, says my writing always looked like chicken scratch.
But now, I don't even try to write cursive.
Instead I print, slowly, deliberately, and poorly.
After just a few words, my hand begins to cramp and my printing gets really bad.
So, thank technology for computers.
Although, my typing and spelling are not much better than my printing.
Thank technology for spell check!

Yes, it's not a trick title.
My wife, for my health, has encouraged me to start walking on our treadmill.
We purchased it after we moved to Florida for her to keep in shape with.
As you know, I have had increased issues with major muscle group pain, especially in my legs.
So, since my Neurologist in Virginia wanted me to stretch and do some physical workouts,  she decided the treadmill would be good for m.  The treadmill offers me a secure place to walk.
I am actually surrounded by a grab bar and I am home, so if there is an issue, I am in a safe location.
Also, I won't use the treadmill unless she is here.
My poodle, Marcel, watched me play "Hamster on the wheel" as if to say;  You're not going anywhere!
And, where do we pee?"
Just the same, he stayed by the machine for the 22 minutes I walked.
Before I was attacked by Mr. Lewy, I was a disciplined workout nut.
I used the gym at work, before I went home, at least three times a week.
And my wife and I walked our neighborhood for hours.
I used to accuse her of taking me on the "Bataan death march" every time she wanted to walk to trim down!
Walking is also relaxing for her and I enjoy it also.
But, I am increasingly unstable and I get tired easily, so I don't go on big walks anymore.
So, the treadmill may be the answer.
I did well for my first tie, I walked 22 minutes, a little over a mile, and my legs hurt.
But, they hurt before I got on the treadmill, so, no change there.
I am sure it is good for my waistline, my heart, and probably my other issues.
In any case, it won't hurt!
Now, let's see if I can get disciplined enough to keep it up.
I am sure my wife will help!
I' glad!

Since we were small children, there were things we did not want to tell someone.
For instance, when Mom asked; "Who broke this vase?!"
or, "What did you do now?!".
Of course, there is always the awkward time when your date had broccoli in her teeth.
And we want to have to tell our loved ones bad news.
There are all sorts of stories about men who lost their job, but kept going through the motions because they could not bear to tell their wife the bad news.
I have reached that point in the progress of my disease.
There are just more negative issues than good ones.
For instance, my major muscles ache most of the time from the "push and pull" muscles fighting each other.
The pain is not excruciating, but it is constant and building.
Because of this near constant pain, I don't feel like taking big walks, doing exercise, or anything else that makes the muscles work too much.
Not to mention that I have very little energy an even less desire to do much of anything.
I have a cold that my family is sharing.
That happens, but every time I get a cold I get bronchitis!
Coughing the phlem out of my chest is very difficult.
So, early in this and every cold, I use Mucenix D.  It works, sort of.
But, I really can't keep track of the doses of medicine and today, my wife determined that I may have taken a different med that is a 24 hour type.
Since we really don't know what I took, I cannot take anything!
It is going to be a tough night, without breathing!
So, now I cannot manage even my cold meds.
More loss of control for me.
Again, things are ganging up on me and it is becoming an issue.
My wife was talking in the car today about the effect of Medicare and Tricare for Life on our health care costs.
She was talking about an issue that is five years from now for me and I told her; "I really can't see five years from now."
I used to have fairly good forward thought and planning but now, tomorrow is long range planning.
Of course, I don't want to tell my family about these issues, they already have their emotional plates full.
And I know their defense point is that I will be as good as I was yesterday, forever, but you, I, and they know that is not the reality of the future.
Again, I know that is hard to face.
So, I just don't say much.
Of course, when I don't want to do what they think I should, they think I am being obstinent or uncooperative.
The truth is, I just can't walk four miles, paddle a canoe against the current, or most other things that I used to do.
I am even deferring to my wife for the driving duties.
That is difficult for me since I like to drive and have always believed it is the man's job to do the majority of the family driving.
But, it is time to let her do more driving.
So, I guess I have now told everyone where I am and that is one of the purposes of this blog.
But, it is still difficult and painful for me, a macho Alpha Male, to admit I am not what I used to be, and that no amount of exercise, therapy, or medicines will restore me to my previous status.
And that is the hardest thing for me to tell them, especially my wife.
She has always treated me as her hero and now her Superman is wearing a kryptonite suit.

In a few days it will be 2012!
Happy New Year!
I look at the changing of the calender with interest and maybe just a little pensiveness.
I just read a new study that presents the idea that Lewy Body Dementia patients have a life expectancy shorter that like aged Alzheimer's patients.
I found that interest and a little unnerving.
Yes, there are individuals with LBD that have survived 20 or more years.
Yet, the study found that the average life expectancy was eight years!
Now, don't get all weak knee on me.
It is a study, and that is an average.
But, it still causes me to pause since I am at the 4 year mark and I am seeing an increase in symptoms and a speeding up of their development.
For instance, I have written about the increase in muscle cramping and pain, especially in major muscle groups.
Today, while driving on Interstate 10, I had a muscle spasm that caused me to speed up and slow down, maybe 3 miles per hour, just for an instant.
No big problem yet, a big problem.
I don't tailgate, so it would not effect me there, unless the spasm lasted longer.
I drive now, but I wonder how much longer.
Another issue is perspiration.
I break out in major sweat just doing minimal labor.
Like removing the sheets from the bed.
I know from reading that the automatic functions of my body are impacted by the LBD.
But, it is still increasing and therefore an issue to look at.
I am more emotionally impacted in the evening, and this has increased somewhat.
I need my quiet time.
But, I also need to get out and about, even if I don't think I do.
For instance, I had no thought of going anywhere today.
But, my wife knew I needed a day out.
Again, I did not know that.
But, I agreed and we left the house at 9 AM!
We were out until 4:30 PM, a long day for me.
I enjoyed it and she knew it.
My wife always knows what is good for me.
Back to the New Year.
I am not afraid of the future.
I am interested in how it will unfold and I am concerned over the suffering my family will go through as I deteriorate.
This is inevitable, but still it causes worry.
So, as I look at new medical and scientific information and compare that to what I know I am experiencing, it causes me to pause.
When we are young, we want the days to pass quickly as we wait for those milestones in life.
Christmas, our driver's license, graduation,  even retirement.
Now, as I enter the home stretch of life, I am not so anxious for that quick passage of time.
Yet, I also know what the future holds.
The question is when, not how.
Remember, I write this blog to describe what I am experiencing as a way of release for me and a resource for those sufferers of LBD and their care takers.
It truly does help me and I know it helps others because they have told me so.
Their communications with me is also a great comfort.
I am able to communicate these feelings, emotions, thoughts now.
In the future, I am sure my wife will take over the writing to continue this string to it's natural conclusion.

Merry Christmas to everyone!
This is a season that I have always had problems with.
Even before LBD, I suffered from depression and withdrawal during Christmas.
I did not like the decorations and made Christmas drudgery for my wife.
This year is different!
I have enjoyed the season.
I wanted a Christmas tree.
WE bought a new tree and I put it up as soon as we got it home.
Then, I helped decorate it.
I can truly say, I am fully enjoying this Christmas!!
No depression, No withdrawal.
This is good.
I do not know what brought the drastic change, but I am glad it happened.
So is my wife.
While I know that any good time is followed by a severe degradation of my condition, I am really enjoying this respite.
I will take the bad, later.
I have seen some new articles about Lewy Body Dementia on the Web.
It seems there has been more recent research on our disease that centers on the prognosis.
While some will take this news badly, I am glad to see more attention being paid to LBD.
I pushed my Neurologist for an accurate diagnosis so that my wife and I could concentrate on research and medicines specifically designed for my disease.
I never liked the "Shotgun method" of addressing anything!
Check out what is available on line.
Again, enjoy this season.
It is a season of hope and love.
That is all we really have.
Merry Christmas.

My son and I spent the day touring the USS Alabama.
It was wonderful for me to be back on a combat ship.
As a tech rep at NAVSEACENLANT I worked 16" Guns on the Iowa class Battleships.
The ones on Alabama are 16"/45 but still awesome.
It was great, I was home.
There is always a "but" in today's stories though.
That would be that for the first time, I had difficulty getting around the ship.
Normally, before LBD, I could go up and down ladders, in and out of hatches, without ANY effort.
Today, after an hour I was tired,  We broke for lunch and in the afternoon, I was stumbling, having trouble lifting my legs over the "Knee Knockers" and in general having trouble moving about.
Tonight, even after a soak in my son's hot tub, my legs are stiff, tight, and sore.
I know, what am I complaining about, I got to go see the USS Alabama.
True, and it was wonderful.
But it reminded me of what is happening to me and that always pulls me up short!
Again, this is a report, not a complaint.
Just two months ago, when my wife and I toured the same ship, I was able to get around without pain or difficulty.
Today, that was not the case and I believe that is a progression of my LBD.
I know, soon, I will need my cane all the time and a walker some of the time.
I expect that.
For now, I will remain stubborn and hard headed until I fall and break something!
That's my way of fighting back and not giving in to LBD.

This posting will upset those close to me and I am not writing it to evoke that emotion.
However, I need to record what I am feeling, my reactions, and my emotions.
I must be totally honest for my own well being.
The move to Florida has had it's benefits and issues.
I did not realize how much I liked having the Grandsons, my son and daughter-in-law so close.
We have had a number of family meals, outings and talks, that would not have happened if we lived in Virginia.
We have more planned.
Another positive is, this year, I am enjoying Christmas!
I wanted a big Christmas tree.
I put it up without prompting and even decorated it.
That is different for me.
I am getting more acclimated to the area and even drove back from the commissary today, without the GPS!
I did not get lost once.
So, all these things are positives.
However, my mental acuity, my desire to stay home,  my moodiness, depression and difficulty with nights has become more of an issue.
I continually have issues with noises at night and I have problems getting to sleep at night.
I do not feel, in my mind, that Florida is my home, even though I like this house.
My emotions tell me this is a nice place to visit, now let's go home.
But, my mind tells me, my stuff is here, so this must be home.
I am in conflict.
I spend more time thinking about the past, my parents, my Navy career, old shipmates, school friends.
I look up old friends through computer searches, but I don't contact them because I fear rejection.
I am secure in my home, and frightened otherwise.
It all wears on me.
Another frustration of LBD is the continual "on and off" of this disease.
I have had times that I felt there was nothing wrong with me, and other times, I feel so out of it, that I don't know how to take my next step.
I got a haircut today, and for a while, I was really not in the chair.
I could not figure out how my hair got so long.
After the haircut, I sat on the bench waiting for my wife.
I could have been anywhere.
Florida, Virginia, Ohio, California, anywhere.
Then my wife showed up and I was back "on".
That is very frustrating to me.
I had another thing to write, but it is now, not in my mind.
Another frustration.
So, "Where do I go from here?"
is really the question.
My logical mind says; "This is home now."
My LBD mind says;  "Where do I go from here?"

I have been blogging quite a bit lately.
There are two reasons;  One, I have noticed more issues.
Two.
I need to release the stress through my writing.
Writing these blogs feels like I am talking to friends, who care.
It is good for me.
Tonight I am writing about my evenings.
When the sun goes down, I am really noticing an increase in the effects of noise and stress.
I have written before about how noise causes me to react negatively.
I get angry, yell, cringe, recoil, to a loud noise, the increase in volume of the television commercials, or the telephone ringing.
I also notice that I am more verbally aggressive to things I view on the television.
I say things I would not normally say and react in a manner that upsets my wife.
It is unintentional but, disturbing just the same.
Another issue is my reaction to stressful situations.
During the day, Things bother me less in the day than at night.
For instance, television shows.
A drama during the day, I view as entertainment.
But at night, the same genre of drama upsets me so much that I need to turn the show off.
Another issue happens when there is an issue in our household.
I try to remain calm, not loose my temper, and not react to others emotions.
But that internal fight causes me emotional issues, internal anger, and depression.
I try not to show it, but I know it shows.
Just the same, loosing my temper over something, big or small, is not productive and certainly not good for me and those around me.
I am truly not sure how to deal with this issue.
I will bring it up with the new Neurologist in January.
That's not too far away.
PS;  One other issue, every evening my legs now hurt, ache, feel tight, like the muscles are fighting with each other.
During the day, if we walk a moderate amount, my legs hurt and begin to get weak.
The fact is, I just cannot walk as far as before.
Walking is an exercise my wife and I both enjoy.
But I cannot do our Batann Marches anymore.
I also notice other large muscle groups being painful in the evening, even without excessive use during the day.
But it is my legs that worry me.
The Family Practice Physician I visited yesterday did a leg lift test and then asked me if I noticed weakness in my legs.
I told him I had and he acted like he already knew what my answer would be.
Again, something to discuss with the new Neurologist in January.

Yesterday's doctor's appointment brings a funny story to mind.
A while ago, I had an appointment with my previous neurologist's Psychologist.
She and I had a good discussion about how I was dealing with my disease and at the end she asked me; "Are your suicidal?"
I answered hew with a simple, "no".
Then she asked me; "Are you homicidal?"
My answer was a little longer,  I told he; "No, I like sex with women!"
It took her a minute to digest my comment, and then she burst into laughter.
I had an Executive Officer on a ship that I was stationed on that always said; "If you aren't having fun, your doing something wrong.
Life is supposed to be fun!"
I agree with him and I try to find humor in anything I can.
That moment was funny, at least to me.

One of my fears with the move to Florida was finding a doctor I could relate too.
My Family Doctor in Virginia Beach was a wonderful, caring, personal, man with professionalism and compassion that is rarely seen.
I was his patient for 15 years and I did not want to leave his care or his friendship.
Today, I went to visit a Family Practice doctor who was recommended by my Son's Brother in Law, who is also a Doctor.
This fellow is very caring and seems genuinely interested in my care.
He listened to my ramblings and I believe he was interested.
However, I learned something today filling out all the forms, answering all his questions abbot my condition, my past injuries, my exposure to the hydraulic fluid in the Navy, and my surgeries;  I learned that I am SICK!
There's a lot going on with me and none of it is good.
I am a wreck!
I was rode hard and put up wet.
I abused my body and the Navy did the same, for over 40 years and now I am paying the price.
I suppose this is nothing new to you who read my blog, but it just overwhelmed me to openly discuss everything at one.
In one 45 minute appointment, we discussed ten years of medical procedures, operations, medicines, tests, and symptoms.
Again, I say, WOW, I am sick!!
I also had difficulty conveying all of my issues.
I would formulate an answer to his question and then loose half of the answer.
Then, two questions past the answer I lost would pop up in my memory and I would tell him about that issue.
He must really be confused!
I know I was.
But, he calmly listened and asked leading questions.
I almost felt like I was talking to a speed dating service!
Maybe not.
But, it was rapid fire questions and answers, separated by gaps in memory on my part.
But, he is a keeper.
Now, we will see how the neurologist is in January.

Tonight, my wife and I watched a new episode of the television show, "Law and Order, Special Victims Unit".
It addressed the effects of Dementia on one's ability to understand the difference between right and wrong.
I will tell you that the writers went around the "Prostitution" corner to portray this issue and I wish they would have chose another venue to portray the terrible effects of Dementia.
But, at least they DID show the terrible confusion that someone with Dementia suffers.
The person effected with Dementia was a retired professional football player suffering from Dementia from the terrible beating that football players take starting in "Pop Warner" youth football, high school, college, and maybe, if they make it, professional football.
However, many military men have had numerous, repetitive concussions and suffered them long before they came under the scrutiny they are now.
In any case, the person suffering from Dementia commits suicide in the end because he finally faced his disease and he could not live with the reality of that truth.
One of the facts that this brought out was the need, the absolute necessity to diagnose Dementia early.
Why, because when we are still in "The Now" we, the effected persons, can deal with the disease logically.
We can talk about Dementia, research it, digest it.
The person in "Law and Order" was pretty far down the Dementia path when he finally faced his disease.
Do we, those who suffer from Dementia think about suicide?
I cannot answer for everyone, but I have.
But, I choose NOT to take my own life because I did not give myself life, GOD did.
Therefore, I cannot, I am not authorized, to take my life.
Truthfully, it is not my life, but Jesus life, since HE lives within me.
So, suicide is out of the question.
Yet, I will welcome my "calling home" when GOD chooses to call me.
Until then, I will continue to share my experiences and my journey until I am unable to do so.
Thanks for being there for me.
It helps to know I am reaching so many people.
Another issue came to the fore front today as I read the blog of a fellow sufferer's wife and caretaker.
He has lost his ability to remember the people in his life and can be difficult to take care of.
She has chose to sleep in a separate bedroom to maintain her sanity.
She monitors him by camera and monitor, so he is never really alone.
In her blog, she told of the stress, pain, and dismay of making this decision.
Those of us who suffer from LBD can be difficult to live with and even worse to sleep with.
Bad dreams and the fact that unlike people not suffering from LBD, we CAN act out our dreams!
So, we can and DO hit our spouses, not in anger, but in acting out our dreams.
SO, I can see the day coming when my wife will have to do the same thing.
While I try to be a good patient, I fail and I am not as far down the road as this ladies husband is.
She has endured much more than she should have and has bore that burden in love.
Separate bedrooms will only make he a better care giver and give her the rest she needs.
The moral of this story is, caregivers need care also.
If you are related to a caregiver, step in and give them a day off, and afternoon out, or a special dinner.
They will appreciate it.

<doc date=Sunday, December 4, 2011>
My last visit to the neurologist in Virginia was to  a new neurologist at the recommendation of my neurologist.
The new doctor was young, newly educated, and more up to date on LBD.
She was wonderful, not bashful, and not affraid to say things that shocked me.
St told me that I had not yet come to terms with my disease.
I openly disagreed with her and she said I was full of, you know what!
Now I know she was right.
Her forcefulness made me think, and I have been since that day.
I have known in my mind, that I was sick for a while, but I never really accepted the fact that I was sick and I was not going to get better.
I have been doing OK, some ups and more downs, yet I always fooled myself that I would be OK in the end.
Now, I am beginning to digest the facts that this is as good as I will ever be and I am going to get progressively worse until I die.
Now that is the reality of my condition.
Again, I have addressed that fact in theory, but not as a actuality in my life.
I have written that I have the ability to look at my disease as if I was out of my body, looking at what was happening to me in a subjective manner.
Now, I am actually experiencing the problems live!
She really shocked me into looking at the realit of my condition.
That brings me to another related issue.
My emotions are raw and I am sensitive about anything directed at me.
When my wife asks me a question about something I have done, I automatically think I am being disciplined!
I react as the child who was caught!
Today, I addressed that with my wife and she understood my emotional position.
She is good about listening to me and trying to understand my needs.
So, much like how I reacted to the neurologist, I react in a defensive manner whenever I feel challenged, disciplined, or corrected, by anyone.
That's is just the fact of where I am.
And, since I now am getting better at accepting the reality of my condition, I can tell you, it will not get better.
So, like the title, it's not what you say, it's how I perceive what you say.
If I get defensive, you will have to look at what you said through my eyes.
That's called compassion.
And that is what I need.

Today, my wife and I had a good day.
We had some business to conduct at the County Tax Assessor's Office and that went very well.
We walked on the Navarre pier.
It was beautiful, the weather was warm, the Gulf of Mexico was inviting, and we had a great time.
After that, we went to the Air Force base to check out their rifle and pistol club.
They have a good facility that will meet most of my needs and desires.
The thing that was missing was Navy personnel!
I was surrounded with Air Force personnel.
Not that they are bad or sub-standard, but they are not the people that I have been with for 40 years.
Additionally, Pensacola is an aviation base.
So the sailors and officers there are "Brown Shoe" sailors not the "Black Shoes" that I am used to.
Neither the Air Force personnel or the Navy Aviators know about or care about Navy combat ships, gun mounts, or Gunner's Mates!
And I miss that camaraderie.
That loss negative effects me.
Do I think it will pass, probably.
But for now, I have no one to talk too and no one to relate too.
So, we will see.
Maybe I will take an add out in the local paper for a Navy "Black Shoe" to talk to.
It can't hurt!

It is interesting the effect small disappointments in life have on me.
For instance tonight, two of my favorite television shows were not on.
They should be new, but they were preempted for a Christmas special that has been on every year for 40 years!!
That really aggravated me!!
Now, I know that is a small issue, but I am such a "routine" driven person now that I get angry over the slightest change in my routine.
Another issue is that I cannot figure out the new cable system that we have here in Florida.
Now, I know that learning new things is almost impossible because of the "Executive Function" of my brain is broken by my LBD.
Just the same, knowing and being effected by it are two different things.
Many times I know it is Lewy causing me my issues, but I still get extremely angry.
Another issue is web sites changing their look.
For instance, the web tool I use to produce this blog.
Some "Geek" somewhere, thinks changing the look of things is good.
Why is changing what works, good?
CHange drives me up the wall!!
Don't change things, leave them alone!!
What do I do, nothing.
I try to hide my anger, but that only causes more issues.
So, I will just continue to cling to things as they are.
At least until I no longer remember how things were.

Have you seen the mini series advertised on the Lewy Body Dementia Association web site titled "Boss"?
It is pure rubbish!
I watched an episode today, because I saw it advertised on the LBD site.
They stated that it was about a man with LBD and the effects of the disease on him and his family.
NOTHING could be farther from the truth.
It is a series filled with Foul, foul, language, nudity, illicit sex, political power brokering, and intrigue.
But not a SINGLE word about LBD or it's effects on the sufferer or the care taker.
If Hollywood wants to make a movie about our disease, please tell about the despair of loosing your memory, your motor skills, your independence.
Please tell about the wear and tear on the spousal care giver.
Please show the limited institutional care choices and the cost of these services.
Don't pervert our disease with Hollywood smut!
Shame on you Lewy Body Dementia Association for touting this series as being representative of us sufferers!
Shame!

I have found and increasing inability to deal with all but the mundane things of life.
A mention of the budget, what we spend, savings, planned purchases, anything money, make me want to run into the closet and hide!
This problem has been growing and I knew it was there, but the recent rapid rise is disturbing to me.
Now, I will be honest, I was never into the day to day budgetary management of our family.
My wife has handled that job in an exemplary manner over our almost 39 years of marriage.
But, it never caused me pain when we discussed our budget, and I always managed the long term finances.
But now, I am overwhelmed and repulsed by this topic to the point of wanting to run away.
It would be interesting if it were not so unnerving for me.
I am quickly loosing contact with daily life.
There is little I want to do, and that is not totally new, just more so.
I only want sleep, eat, and watch a few television shows, mostly reruns, that I like.
I see no need to shower daily, shave, or even brush my teeth.
This also has been a progressive degradation.
But, it is what it is.
My wife makes a great effort to get me out of the house and takes me places of interest.
Today, we walked the Navarre Pier.
It was a warm day and a pleasant time.
But, she wanted to look at the fish, the surfers, and move around the pier, I wanted to sit on a bench.
I realize this is the natural progression of my disease, but for the first time, I am actually angry at my condition.
Again, a new emotion.
We will see what happens next.

<doc date=Saturday, November 19, 2011>
As most of you know, we have moved to Florida and we are in the throws of settling into a new home.
As you know, this required shelf lining, hanging pictures, towel bars, coat hooks, even putting together some of that "Easy to Assemble", "Even a Five Year Old can do it" furniture.
All of that has gone surprisingly well.
Yes, because my brain has problems controlling my autonomic functions, I SWEAT at drop of a hat.
As a matter of fact, putting on my hat causes me to perspire profusely.
I also get tired very easily.
So, what used to take me a day to do, takes a week.
However, my wife has been very understanding and very supportive of me.
She has kept my pace to one I can handle, and I really appreciate that.
However, last evening, I ran into a problem that cascaded to the point of frustration and tears.
We had purchased a shelving unit for the office, and after the "easy" assembly, I was placing the computer router, my APPLE remote access computer transmitter, into the shelves.
To o this, I had to disconnect both units to route the wires through the back of the shelving unit.
This is where I got in trouble.
It would not have been hard, a few years ago, but since I have NO short term memory, I could not get the APPLE unit wired correctly.
I was frustrated because there were two wires that have oblivious places and the third wire had four places to go.
Try as I might, I could not remember where that wire went and I tried every combination.
Finally, after accidentally creating my own WEB unit, I gave up and called my son who lives very close.
He graciously came over, with his wife, and fixed my mistake.
For him, it was a five minute job.
For me, it was a mountain too high.
I am very thankful that we live close.
But, if I had not moved, the computer would have been fine!
Probably not.
I had my eye on these shelves for a while.
P.S.
Writing this blog post, I am sweating profusely, to the point of having to wipe my brow, and it is 71 in the house!
This is a strange disease.
</doc>
<doc date=Sunday, November 13, 2011>
I have always been a person who learns from watching.
Yes, I HAD almost total recall of all that I read, heard, and saw.
It served me very well through out my technical career.
Now, my memory is diminishing at an alarming rate.
A least, an alarming rate to me.
But I still try to observe the reaction, people close to me have over issues I have or cause.
For instance, some people close to me react in a very interesting way to my postings.
I write, what I believe, are insightful, honest, reflections of my emotions and symptoms as I progress through LBD.
I do this as therapy for me and to record this journey for who ever wanted to know what I went through.
Some folks choose to get upset and react in ways that are emotional instead of just taking what I say as a statement of fact.
I know they worry and love me.
But, I still need to have the latitude to be honest and open.
Another, issue is that some people get angry with me when I have done my honest best to remember things and accomplish tasks, and yet have not measured up to their expected level for me.
Some folks close to me continue to hold me to the standard I once met easily, but now can't ever hope to reach again.
I can understand their frustration.
Heck, I am frustrated!
But, they must understand that I am not being the way I am on purpose!
I cannot be held accountable for the way my brain works.
It is a disease, a chemical deficiency and brain function failure that causes me to be the way I am.
I began this post some days or weeks ago and set it in the "Draft" section until tonight.
Why, because I did not want to hurt any one's feelings   Today, I helped my wife make dinner for our friends and family.
One of my jobs was to bake the ham.
I followed the instructions on the ham wrapper to the letter.
About 45 minutes after I placed the ham in the Nesco roaster, I noticed a faint haze of smoke coming from the roaster.
I thought it was fat burning off, but I went to check.
That is when I found out the ham had two wrappers on it!
The outer wrapper which I carefully removed, as instructed on the wrapper.
They did not tell me there was another thin, wrapper around the ham, and I just did not notice.
I would have before LBD, but evidently not now.
It came off easily after being heated to 325 degrees!
No harm, the ham was very good and no one got sick.
But, this is another example of me not being capable of meeting expectations.
This is also the first I have said anything about my mistake.
Why, pride, sensitivity, shame, self-anger, I guess.
I hate not being able to be depended on.
That may be the one thing that hurts the most.

Well, the boxes are unpacked and gone, the furniture is in it's place, the refrigerator and washer/dryer are delivered,  (although with great difficulty from Best Buy) and we have shades on the windows.
Life is returning to normal or something that resembles normalcy.
We even made it to Church today!
Also, we had our family over for dinner on Saturday and that was great!
So, many of the things I wanted from this move are coming to pass.
However, my wife and I have both noticed a degradation in my condition.
I am more detached from the world around me and I notice that I look at the world around me from  distance.
It feels like I just woke up from a long sleep and am still groggy.
I am also noticing some problems with the autonomic functions of my body.
I have trouble maintaining my body temperature at a normal temperature.
I am either too hot or too cold.
My neurologist noticed that my blood pressure was elevated, but I have also had recent times when my blood pressure was normal.
Both of these are normal issues for people with LBD.
However, they are new to me.
I can actually feel when my blood pressure is elevated.
As things get more routine, I hope, but do not believe, that I will return to where I was two months ago.
That's not bad, it is just the way it is.
Knowing about this disease makes it easier to deal with it.
It also makes me expectant of future changes.
It is like waiting for the thunder after seeing the lightening.
You know what is coming, but you don't like waiting for it to come.
That may not make sense to most, but it is how my mind works.

I almost feel like I should have a disclaimer stating; "Professional idiot, don't try this at home!"
Making a cross country move, while suffering with mid-stage Lewy Body Dementia is not a good idea!
I may go as far as to say, learn from me, but don't try this yourself.
Yes, I am very happy to be with my Son, Daughter in law, and grandsons.
And Florida may be a nice place.
But moving away from my know surroundings, friends, doctors, church, and landmarks was not a good idea.
The stress of moving across the hall in the same building is tough enough, moving into everything new is frightening!
Nothing is as it seems or as it once was.
The stores that promise delivery don't keep their promises.
The companies that provide services, don't.
It is a constant fight to maintain.
My poor wife is overwhelmed with unpacking, arranging, organizing an entire home.
All this while she worries about my well being.
This move is like a television show where the hero jumps out of a car at 70 mph and gets up to fight three bad guys, and wins!
Watch the show, but don't ever try it yourself.
I think they call that living vicariously.

We are a day away from getting our furniture, but we now own a home, again, and we have Florida Driver's Licenses and our car has a Florida tag on it.
So, we are officially Floridians.
The home closing was a bit difficult, drawn out, and frustrating.
We were supposed to close at 3PM and did not sign the papers until 6:30 PM.
But, it is done.
This move has been harder than I thought on me.
Yes, I wrote about the expected issues before, but I am really having issues with energy levels and attention span.
I am good for about two hours and then I fade into a fog.
I cannot pay attention to any details, have problems staying on track with a conversation, and have problems formulating sentences.
I guess this was all to be expected, but I am still somewhat unnerved by it.
I hope these declines in my mental ability reverse after we get completely settled, but that may only be wishful thinking.
Our furniture gets delivered Sunday.
The driver called today and asked to make the delivery Sunday instead of Monday because he has an issue at home.
Who am I to say no.
Our refrigerator does not come until Wednesday, but that will have to do.
Every step in this process has been painful to me.
But I still think it will be a good move, after the dust settles.

One of the BIGGEST stressors for me and my wife is the new mortgage rules.
I did not provide this much information to get a Top Secret Clearance to work in Nuclear Weapons!!
They want every financial statement, every five minutes.
The loan officer just explained to me it is because of the issues with the "Sub Prime" mortgages.
He said we were fine, but we have to meet the requirements for no loads!
Today, we were required to prove we had the money in the bank to cover a "Certified Cashier's Check" that is already cut and sitting in my brief case!!
Now that is stupid!
But what is even worse, is that things like this drive me to the point where I can no longer function.
I really feel that we should have paid cash!
I have really lost my ability to objectively look at anything at this moment.
I believe I will go to sleep.
The moral of the story;  If you are a great credit risk, you will be treated like a no load.
Why work your entire life, following the rules of the society, if there is no benefit.
I could have been a "No Load" and be treated the same way,  This country is falling apart with this treat everyone the same stuff!!
I will sleep now.

I write from a hotel room in Augusta Georgia.
We are completing the first leg of our relocation cruise.
We will be in Gulf Breeze Florida tomorrow.
The movers from Bekins Movers did a wonderful job packing us out and moving us!
We were packed n Friday and they loaded the truck today.
We were on the road by 2PM.
Yesterday, my Church, Grace Community Church off Virginia Beach gave me a great send off.
I had the opportunity to preach my last sermon, at least for a while, and my brothers and sisters in Christ made Linda and I feel loved.
Our best friends, Jerry and Marcia were there as well as Nancy Allen from the Virginia Beach Senior Services.
It was the hardest part of our move to Florida.
I truly love all of these people.
They are very important to me and I will miss them, tremendously.
Yes, I know this move has many good points.
Finally being with my Son, Daughter in Law, and grandsons again, is a dream come true.
But these friends have been a life line for me.
I will miss them and I hope they come to visit us soon!
More driving tomorrow, busy Wednesday getting ready for the closing on our home, Thursday closing, Next Monday the furniture arrives!
We are going to be busy!
So I will rest for now.
Thanks Virginia Beach!

Well, today is the day.
The movers come this morning to pack our belongings.
In other moves, my wife and I did this.
I remember her carefully wrapping and re-wrapping our china.
That was always the first thing she did.
But, this time we are trusting the "Professionals".
How am I doing?
As good as I can be expected to be doing.
I have a "Fight or Flight" feeling right now.
I am very apprehensive of what is going on and I have a need to talk to people.
I will be very glad when this is over.
I went to my neurologist's appointment a day or so ago.
My long time neurologist has a new member in the practice and she wanted me to see her.
I must say, she was very good.
She had extensive knowledge about LBD and she explained things about my disease that I had nerve been told.
She also "Confronted" me about facing the reality of my future.
She aggressively encouraged me to seek counseling to help me face the future and also my present state!
Again, she was very direct yet very concerned.
I liked her approach and I am sorry that I will not be able to continue with her.
She recommended I seek treatment from the University of Alabama.
Her statement was any neurologist can "Baby sit" me, but to get the proper testing and up to date information I needed the University setting at least once a year.
I am sure my wife will take that advice and act on it.
Another "close out" for the move comes Sunday.
I believe I have told you that I am an Ordained Pastor at my local Church.
Positionally, I am the junior Associate Pastor.
But it was an unbelievable honor to have the members of my Fellowship vote to Ordain me.
This Sunday is our last time worshipping with these wonderful people.
The Senior Pastor has given me the honor of speaking this Sunday.
I have preached a number of times in this Church, but this one will be difficult.
I have my sermon done, and I am ready.
But I do not think I am ready for the emotions I will experience.
In any case, the move progresses, with or without me.
I am trying to stay engaged.
But I must admit, I would be much more comfortable in my bed with the covers pulled up!

<doc date=Monday, October 17, 2011>
OK, I admit it, LBD and age are really doing me in!
We are having professional movers do this move but, we are packing most of the art work and some things that are precious to us.
Just doing that, really HALF of that today, has really worn me out!
Used to be, I could work all day, party all night, and repeat that sequence for a week!
I was a hard worker, strong, resilient, worked and played hurt.
Now, I just cannot keep up.
There was a comedian, from the early days of Red Foxx, her stage name was "Moms Mably".
She made it on the nightly talk shows.
She was mainly known for "Blue" humor.
But, one night on the Merv Griffin show, she said; " My get up and go, got up and left!!"
I now know what she meant!
My energy level is very low, no matter how much sleep I get or what I eat.
I realize this is a symptom of LBD, but I thought it would manifest itself later.
Guess what, later is now!!
No big deal, I just have to pace myself.
Pack a box, nap for an hour, pack another box, another hour's nap.
Sounds like a good theory to me.
Tomorrow, I have my last appointment with my neurologist's office.
That should be interesting.
I will let you know how that goes.
Now, it's nap time!

If you read my post of a few days ago, I told you about my Doctor's view that my symptoms will get because of the move.
He did tell me he thought the move would be good for Linda and me, but he cautioned me to expect a worsening of my symptoms.
I can tell you that I am already seeing issues.
What causes this degradation?
Stress, change, the unknown, the loss of my known safe environment, and the general uprooting that a major move causes.
On my other blog; "The Master Chief's Lair" I wrote about my emotions over leaving my long time best friend and his wife and family.
Leaving my Church family is almost as tramatic form Linda and me.
Tonight, we had a communion service together.
Since this will be our last communion with our Church family, it was bitter sweet to ssay the least.
We have grown greatly in out faith and Bible knowledge under the teaching of ouf our senior Pastor.
He is a gifted teacher and an accomlished Bible scholar.
But there are others in our Church family that have equally help us to grow.
This fellowship is truly a family.
We are one, regardless of good times or bad.
We work together, pray together, bear each others problems, and love each other.
We all know that, no matter what, we can call on our Church family for real help!
Not just a cursery: "I will pray for you", but real work.
I remember when I was putting a roof on our home.
missed Church on Sunday because I had so much to do and I hurt so much from the labor of re-roofing a house.
Instead of giving me a hard time for missing Church, the majority of the Church members came to my house after Church and helped me clean up by picking up the old shingles on the groung, raking the yard and sweeping the drive way to ensure there were no stray nails to hurt someone or flatten a tire.
I can give you ten other examples of this fellowship's love in action, but you get the idea!
I will miss this Christian family.
I am not sure if there is another one in the world like them.
I will miss them and there will always be a part of my heart missing because of this move.
You cannot live somewhere for 28 years and not feel the loss when you move away.
Yet, this move will be positive.
Having my son and family close will help Linda and me.
We have been away from them way too long.
I need this family connection now, more than ever.
So, broken heart and all, it's off to Florida we go.

I had an appointment with my Primary Care Physician yesterday.
He is a great Doctor and friend.
He was very aggressive in finding my disease and has followed up on every turn of this prognosis.
I told him of our planned move and he was shocked, to say the least!
He offered some insight into what I should expect as far as my LBD is concerned.
He told me to expect a down turn in my disease.
In other words, I should expect to get worse.
My memory will suffer, and I assume other mental issues will decline.
He did not say if that decline would be permanent but I believe he meant it would.
How much of a decline is yet to be seen.
He was also very adamant me not doing yard work.
That was one big reason we sold the last house.
I have lost so much muscle strength and mass that I get exhausted and over heated doing the simplest physical labor.
I could ride a lawn mower, that is no work, but I even sweat and get tired doing that at the church.
My son has assured me that he would take care of the yard work.
I am sure he will.
The preparations to the move seem to overwhelm me also.
Taken in small bites, I do well, but I notice, and my wife does too, that I quickly tire and loose my ability to cope with people, noise, and being away from home.
So, we are doing things in small doses and managing my time as well as we can.
Of course, you can't manage the people who you come in contact with.
Some are very good and some,  not so good!
We went to Best Buy yesterday to purchase a refrigerator, washer, and dryer for the new house.
The associate we worked with was very good!
He was knowledgeable, efficient, and caring.
He made fast work of our order and I was impressed.
So, all in all, we are handling the move pretty well.
I am excited about the new home and the prospects of being with my son and his family.
I am concerned as to how this will effect me, but life effects me anyway.
So, we will see what we see.

<doc date=Wednesday, October 5, 2011>
I went into visit my friends where I worked before I retired.
I knew today, or more so, this week was probably the last time I would have the ability to visit my old office.
The next few weeks will be filled with the rush of moving preps and packing.
My wife is doing a stellar job of getting our financial affairs in order for the move.
I am taking care of the few items in the apartment that I have to take down, patch, or remove.
Actually, I don't have much to do.
That's good, because I don't think I can do much.
I am increasingly overwhelmed with this move.
Yes, I know it is good for us.
And, yes, I think it will be good for me once we are settled.
However, I am very concerned how this move, the uprooting of me from my routine, will effect the progression of my disease.
Do I think we should not move to Florida?
No, since I think it is good for the entire family.
But, everyone involved needs to know and understand the stress this brings on me.
I will have NO ROUTINE!
Nothing will be as it was!
My friends, doctors, stores, locations of everything in the home and out, will be unknown to me.
My best friends have been close to me for over 30 years!
Now they will be 900 miles away!
I am unnerved and this is the first time I have acknowledged this.
Some of my friends at work voiced their concern for my well being but even they agreed that this was a good move.
Again, I know we are moving for all the right, sensible, reasons.
And I cherish the idea of being close to my son and his family.
I know Linda and I will receive abundant love and support from them.
But, there is still the real issue of how this will effect me, for the short and long term.
I know Linda knows this and has considered it in the move planning.
I also know she will carry a tremendous amount of personal stress and worry over my well being.
This also concerns me.
Another fact to discuss is, as I write this, I am very connected and rational.
However, I have had increasing bouts of decreased rationality and connection to the present.
Even today, during my visit to work, I found myself drifting off into a disconnected state.
It seems the present that surrounds me fades away and I am left in a disconnected no where.
I have often described this as the feeling you get as you get increasingly drunk.
I was a quiet, solemn, drunk.
Very few fights, just a mellow, retraction, from the world around me.
That is exactly how I feel during these times.
I loose track of where I am, what time or even what day it is.
Familiar people become strangers to me.
This sensation or state of mind seems to be increasing in frequency and length.
Again, much like my hallucinations, it does not frighten me, I just find it interesting.
So, as this move progresses, and I again must tell everyone, i support this move, regardless of the effect on me, I will be interested in how it effects me and how I react to the changes.
More to come.

No, not that kind!
Or, maybe exactly that kind.
My son and his family, moved, very abruptly, to Pensacola Florida 5 weeks ago.
They had previously spent 8 years in the Finger Lakes area of New York.
Last winter was especially tough and they decided, enough is enough.
So, they now live in Florida.
We went to visit them this week.
Pensacola is nice.
I had been there before, but my wife had not.
I knew, my California born and raised wife would love it.
She did.
The beaches, the palm trees, the warm weather, it is almost as good as Hawaii.
Maybe better, since the grand kids are there!
We have been away from our family since they moved to New York.
We could not move there because we were both working and in the high earning parts of our careers.
Not to mention that we both strongly dislike cold weather, well enough snow up to your ear lobes!
But, now we are both retired, and, as you know, I am in the middle stages of LBD.
Still cognizant most of the time, and still able to cope with a move.
My wife has been sick over missing the grand kids and my son and his wife.
This week, we had a great time with all of the family.
I had the opportunity to go to my youngest grandson's school open house.
I met all of his teachers and interacted with him on issues pertaining to his adjustment to a new school.
It was wonderful for me!
I asked both grandsons, 14 and 12 years old, if they would like to have us live close to them again.
You may recall that we lived two door from them until the youngest was 3!!
In any case, both boys were ecstatic to have us close to them.
Of course, y son is worried about me and his mom.
Having him close would be a great help to my wife as I progress.
So, this is a big win to all of the family.
Of course, there are some negatives.
We have been in the Hampton Roads area of Virginia for 28 years!
We have many close friends.
My Navy friends are very dear to me.
I have many fond memories of this area and what it means to me.
There is also my Church.
I have NEVER been associated with a stronger fellowship of Christians in my life.
They have helped me, loved me, been my family for a long time.
Leaving them will be the hardest.
But, the pull of family is stronger than any other pull.
So, we are moving to Pensacola, Florida.
More correctly, the town of Gulf Breeze, Florida.
It seems a vacation became a way of life.
At least, I hope so.

"Old Blue Eyes"  Frank Sinatra sang a song about; "Regrets, I had a few.." and he was right.
I have a number of regrets that I can now admit.
When you are young, healthy, and death is not a thought you have, you think that you are "bullet proof".
Don't believe me?
Look at the list of Medal of Honor awards.
All of them, or most of them are under 21!
Why, they think that grenade won't hurt them.
When I was young, and I injured myself on the ship, I rubbed it with my dirty rag and kept on going!
I had a number of concussions on the ship that I never told the "Doc" about.
Why, I was supposed to be tough.
Now, I am paying for that toughness.
Now, when I get a cut, I treat it properly so that I do not get an infection.
I am NOT "bullet proof" and I know it!
That was a tough truth to swallow, but I have indeed swallowed it, bitter as it was.
I have regrets about my Navy career that I have discussed at length in my other blog; "The Master Chief's Lair".
But one that I only admitted to myself, until now, is that I regret retiring at 20 years of service!
Yes, I probably made more money the way things turned out, but  left the career I loved.
I let my ego get in the way of my judgement.
My advice to all of you who are young, NEVER listen to your ego!
In every way, it will lead you down the wrong path, and you can't come back!
I regret that I wasted money on houses, cars, booze, guns, trucks, and other foolish endeavors.
Not because I need the money, but because it could have gone for good instead of foolishness.
I tried to be a good husband and a good father.
I tried to provide a secure life for my family, but truthfully, I could have done better.
It is the truth!
But, most of us probably have this regret if we are honest.
Just the same, at this point in my life, it bothers me.
There are things I wanted to do, like drive a NASCAR race car at a driving school.
My Neurologists says I can't do that now.
And my wife is enforcing that rule.
There are places I wanted to see that I will never see.
Why, because now, I don't have the desire to get out of bed, well enough take a trip across country.
I spend way to much time thinking about the "What Ifs" of my past, but the past is what I think of all day and those memories are beginning to fade also.
LBD and any Dementia is a cruel disease  because it robs you of today and imprisons you in yesterday.
You seek comfort, not adventure.
The known instead of the unknown.
Yes, I like the feeling of routine, comfort, and things known.
But I still long, every once in a while to live life on the edge.
But, i know that I would fall off now.
One other thought.
I am full of "Sea Stories" that I still love to tell.
But, no one really wants to hear them.
I write them in the other blog and many folks read that blog.
But, people around me grow weary of my "sea stories".
I don't know if it is because I am a dinosaur or because they never experienced what I did and they think I am not telling the truth.
Just rantings of an old man.
Then again, maybe most people today are not interested in a story about a young First Class Gunner's Mate, throwing up a stomach full of San Miguel and fried rice in a Captains from yard in Navy housing in Subic!

<doc date=Friday, September 9, 2011>
Over  and I had to the last couple of week, I have been overwhelmed with a need to change my living conditions.
The over 55 apartment complex that we live in is fast becoming something it was not supposed to be, a place with kids!
It seems, the management has decided that, as long as ONE person on the lease is 55, any other age is OK.
So, we have teenagers, elementary school kids, and all the problems that come with them.
The parking lot has been littered more than once with broken beer bottles and I had to call the Police on a group of teens parked in our GATED, after mid-night, lot smoking pot!
So, I am less than happy.
Add that to the fact that the people who live over us still have the Rugby Team practicing in their living room and the new neighbors below us like to discuss their life at 1000 decibels.!
So, today we visited a "Continuing Care" community.
It is very nice, some what pricey, and probably not for us.
But, the visit still was educational, specially when the sales person told us I was not eligible for continuing care because of my diagnosis of Lewy Body Dementia.
That was very sobering.
But the sales person spent a few minutes telling me I did not look or act like I had LBD and I should get the doctor to say I was "Cured" and then after we were approved, we could go back to the way things are.
Then, on the way home, her questions brought up all of the old questions of, what if?
I explained to my wife that I am the recruiting poster case of LBD.
Just look at the LBD Association web sight and review the list of symptoms!
I have the "on and off" days and even hours, just as they describe.
Also, as I have discussed before, I HAD near photographic memory.
Ask anyone who served with me in the Navy, or anyone who was in GEICO Material Damage Adjuster's Course in 1989.
I could remember anything.
We had to memorize 200 components in the GM 400 Hydromatic Transmission in one night, no problem.
I aced the test.
The other part of this is that I can "ACT" like I am "Normal".
I can follow your conversation, inject a few comments, and you will think I am just fine.
But, I don;t remember what we talked about or even if we did.
So, after today, I have decided I am no longer going to try to look normal.
I know, I said this before, but, this time I am further degraded and I am tired of trying to make people comfortable with my condition.
So, from now on, people, even family are going to see the un-varnished effects of LBD on me.
Today was an eye opener and also very frustrating for me.
It hurts me to be told I am not ill and I am tired of hiding that pain and the effects of my condition.      
</doc>
<doc date=Monday, September 5, 2011>
Since I remember things when I remember them, I wanted to bring up something that is relevant to my condition.
My Neurologist is a tenacious professional who, once she bites into a case, she will not spit it out!
She has treated me with dogged determination to extend my coherent life as long as is physically possible.
Once she reached the 80% solution on my diagnosis of Dementia,  she immediately placed me on the two newest Alzheimer's drugs.
She then sent me to UVA to get a second opinion.
No professional insecurity here!
The UVA folks determined it was Lewy Body Dementia as I have discussed before.
The UVA Doctors told my wife and I that my Neurologist was the reason I was doing as well as I am.
Here is what I wanted to relay to you.
I did some research on the British medical system.
What I found out is shocking.
IN their system, they reserve Arcept and Namenda for the last six months of the patients life!
Now, what good would administering these drugs after the patient is already gone mentally and deteriorating physically to the point of failure?
Yes what I take is expensive, but it will extend my productive life and keep me from needing extensive medical intervention until the end.
My Father In Law lived in a nursing home, with Alzheimer's, for 7 years, at the States expensive.
There were no drugs for Alzheimer's then, and the State paid the price.
Now there are effective drugs and reserving them until six months before the patient dies is criminal.
So, the next time someone wants to tell you Socialized Medicine is good, tell them about Alzheimer's treatment in Britain.

There are some mysteries in my past that I really would like to have the answers to.
Not, who shot JR Ewing, or what someone would do for a Klondike bar, but there is one question I want to have the answer too.
Those of you who know who I am, may know that I was raised by some marvelous people, who loved me dearly, and I love them, but were not related to me genetically.
My mom and Dad did not have legal custody of me until I was 16.
By then I had got myself in a heap of trouble and my Mom took my shovel away to keep me from digging the hole any deeper!
She was wonderful!
You may also know that my biological Mother was in my life and friends with the people who raised me.
The question I always had, was who was my biological Father?
I was told fabricated stories about my biological father that are not worth going over again.
When I was 32, I found my biological Father and called him.
He denied the connection and I called my biological Mother and confronted her with the truth.
She called my biological Father and they worked out the problems of the past and called me back, telling me the truth and then I called my biological father and talked to him.
He did not really want to talk to me, so I got little information other than him telling me how bad a lady my mother was.
How bad could she be, at least she stayed in my life!!
I talked to him once more, a few years later, and got the same response.
He died in 1989.
He had a son, with his wife, about 6 months after I was born.
He has the same name as me and since he is from the same hometown as me, he has a Social Security Number that starts with the same first three numbers, most likely!
I called him once and he was nice, but has never contacted me again and has refused to return my calls.
I understand their reticence since they probably think I was trying to get an inheritance , which could not be further from the truth.
My half brother is a successful, published, electrical engineer and a senior officer in an electrical company.
He has succeeded and I am happy for him.
But, he IS my brother, blood related to me, and I would dearly love to get to know him, to learn from him, about my biological father, and the medical history of our family.
Through the miracles of Ancestry.com, I have found my biological Father's parents, my grandparents, their immigration dates, death dates, names of my uncles and other family members.
I even met, briefly, my grandfather at a car dealership he worked at.
I was 16 and purchasing an automobile.
Of course, he denied being related.
I am 60 years old, dying from a progressive neurological disease that was most probably caused by exposure to a neurotoxic chemical related to my Navy career.
I don't need any one's money.
But I do need to be accepted by the people I am related to..  My biological mother had three other children after me that were ALL adopted out and I, most likely, will never find them.
But this brother, with the same exact name as me, from the same home town as me, I do know and can have contact with.
But HE does not want to know me.
And that bothers me, more than anyone knows.
How does this relate to my Lewy Body Dementia?
It sets my end date.
My memory is failing.
My ability to deal with reality continues to diminish.
Before my mind quits working, I want to sit down and have a long conversation with my brother, in person.
I believe I deserve that.
Now, those of you who raised me, have stood by me through all of my issues in life, and who stand by me now, know even more than I do.
These secrets have been well kept, guarded, for my protection, and I understand and appreciate that.
But I have to believe someone knows my brother and, maybe even the other children, that my mother had.
I want to meet then, not rob them.
What could you possibly be protecting me from now?
Someone do something, before it is too late.

I really want to thank each of you who read this blog and specially to those who send me replies.
I began this blog looking for a connection to those who are traveling down the same road as I or are a care taker of a person on this road.
I deeply appreciate your experience and encouragement.
It is good to know others are on the same road as I am, even though I may not see them all the time.
You are probably old enough to remember the Citizen's Band Radio (CB) craze of long ago.
I remember we used to drive down the highway, looking for someone a long distance ahead of us to give is the road conditions and a "Smokey Report".
That's what this blog is, people looking down the road, looking for information that will make their trip easier, more comfortable, or maybe, just to share our experiences with.
Almost anyone has had a tooth filled, a broken arm, or their appendix taken out, so we can always find someone with those conditions to commiserate with.
But Dementia of any kind is still not that common and finding someone to compare notes with is difficult.
But through this medium, and others like it, we can share and learn about our journey.
Again, THANKS for your comments and concerns.
You are all in my prayers nightly.
Keep your sense of humor and keep the faith.

I have really curtailed my travel plans for the summer and my canoeing has been limited by the heat and my upper body strength loss, yet I still find thing about my disease that make me laugh.
For instance, I check to see if I closed the garage door numerous time throughout the day, yet I almost always fail to zip my fly after going to the bathroom!
That strikes me as funny.
Another quirk is that, even though my wife manages my prescriptions, I must know how many pills I take at each dose and I count the pills numerous times before I take them.
If I go to bed and don't personally check to see if the doors are locked, I must go back and check, twice.
Another quirk is that before my diagnosis, I took at least one shower a day.
Now, I really find showers annoying and only take a shower when I am going to be with people.
And, I only shave on Sunday!
I cannot remember to get a haircut and only go when my hair touches my ears.
Then I get it cut extremely short.
I used to get my hair cut every two weeks!
Still another change is my new introvert nature.
As I have written before, I always liked to be with people, crowds, and at events.
I drew energy from large groups of people.
But now, I only want to be home, with my wife, or with my best friends.
I enjoy only what I am comfortable with and do not like new experiences or locations.
I can go to our best friends home and be perfectly comfortable.
Why, because I have been at home in their home for 30 years.
But take me to a new place and I am not comfortable and I clam up.
I guess, I am just moving into the next phase of my LBD, at least that is what I read on WEBMD.
My inability to deal with extreme temperatures, extreme sweating, inattention to life's details, all point to my progression.
No big deal, just the facts.
As a tech rep friend of mine says; "It is what it is".
So, that's where I am today.
I am still interested in what tomorrow will bring.

Today, I was enrolled in Project Lifesaver.
It is a wonderful service that the Virginia Beach Police Department offers.
I might add that many police and sheriff departments across the country offer this program.
You can Google "Project Lifesaver" and get the information for your area.
The bottom line is, it will save an individuals life if they wander away.
Why do people wander, Dementia, Alzheimer's, Down Syndrome, Autism, any number of medical condition.
How does it work?
I wear a small transmitter on my wrist that looks like a wrist watch.
It has a transmitter with it's own frequency, specific to me.
Then, if I wander, the police can use receivers in their card and in the helicopters to locate me.
How fast can they find me.
They did a demonstration a few months ago.
They hid a transmitter and then had the police look for a missing person.
It took 38 minutes to find the transmitter in the largest city in Virginia.
Not bad!!
I was visited by a police officer that, it turns out, was a retired Navy Senior Chief.
We shared some mutual acquaintances, so we had fine time reminiscing.
He fitted the device and told my wife about all the features and services available.
He was very informative and very concerned for my welfare.
The city will have someone come by our home once a month to change the battery and make sure everything is going well.
What is the cost of this peace of mind?
$108 per year and that includes batteries, wrist straps, and a testing set.
I find that very reasonable.
If you have a spouse or family member that is suffering with Dementia, I strongly recommend this service.
Hopefully you won't need it, but it will permit you to sleep more soundly at night, knowing your loved one is protected.
I felt much more secure knowing my dog was protected from loss by a "Chip" and now my wife can feel that same sense of peace.
I am glad she took the initiative to protect us.

I don't want you to think that I am complaining, I am not.
But, as many of you know, one of the purposes of this blog is to record what I am going through.
Why, to inform my family and others, to learn from others affected by LBD, and to solicit feedback from care givers and LBD patients.
Recently, I had my son and his family visit for two weeks.
Now, it was not the entire family for two weeks straight, but more of a depot of family travel.
Both grandsons spent a week in a Christian summer camp.
My daughter in law went to another state to search for their new home, and my son traveled for work for a few days.
So, the company I had was as high as four and as little as one.
Just the same, it was company.
Why do I say it that way, because company disrupts my routine.
Now, that is not totally a bad thing.
Sometimes, changing my routine is good for me.
It takes me out of mu comfort zone and makes me adjust.
But, company also brings with it the feeling, for me, of being invaded!
You know, like Sherman's march to the sea!
If you don't know about that disaster, blame Yankee, liberal, public education.
In any case, as much as I like to see family and friends, 2 weeks may be too much.
Another issue with this visit is the going and coming of the visitors.
Again, I am routine driven, and the changing of the numbers of people staying in my home was difficult for me.
Trying to keep track of who is where upset me and my son noticed that.
My wife did make a calender of the people shifts and that helped.
She is the master of organization.
Just the same, I learned or confirmed some things.
One is, I withdraw into myself when I feel invaded.
This is interesting because I used to be a type "A" extrovert who drew energy from crowds.
Second, I see my bedroom as my safe zone.
Sort of a safe room from the invasion.
I would retreat into my room for naps, quiet time, or early bed when I was overwhelmed.
Third, most people still don't know how to deal with me.
My son said that he noticed a degradation in my condition, and he made adjustments in the demands he placed on me.
He realizes that I am not the man I once was.
Yet, he still lives in denial and expects me to be able to be as active as I once was.
One editorial note here;  I still feel that people don't think I am sick and they won't until I am drooling on my shirt and going to the bathroom in my pants!
I still look too normal to the outsider.
Trust me, try looking at life from inside my head!
Things are distorted from my point of view.
Another thing I noticed is that outsiders expect life in my home to equal what they have in their home.
For instance, noise, especially at night, causes me to react negatively.
My wife and I had made accommodations so that the television volume can be kept low while allowing her to hear it.
However, others in the room cannot.
Company has the unreasonable expectation that they should be able to hear the television at the same volume they can at home.
At least, that is unreasonable to me.
Noise of any kind is a problem for me!
Finally, because of my LBD, I am more routine driven than ever.
Everything MUST be in it's place, neat, clean, tidy.
Anything less agitates me.
I must be able to find things immediately or I feel out of control.
Of course, when you have company, things get moved, shifted, and rearranged.
This is a problem for this LBD patient.
One other issue that has become a problem, and it was amplified during this period.
I MUST know where my wife is at all times!
When I come back from taking the garbage out or walking the dog, if my wife is not where I can see her, I call out and locate her.
Then I go see if she is really where she said she was.
Why, she is my security.
If I know where she is, my world is right.
This may become a problem for her down the line.
As I have written before, I truly believe I am entering the middle innings of this disease.
And I know, from research and experience already, that these innings will not be near as easy as the first few.
I know that I am facing the heavy hitters on the LBD team!
Again, I am reporting and recording, NOT complaining.
So, don't be offended, just learn from the experience.
I really enjoyed the visit and I did tell my son that shorter visits may be necessary in the future.
But for now, bring on the visitors, as long as they understand my issues and quirks.
All in all, we all survived the invasion, and maybe, we learned from it.

OK, I need the experience of those of you who are care givers or patients with Lewy Body Dementia.
In the last two days, I have developed a severe cramping in the back my left leg, behind the knee.
It is scary, sharp, immediate, pain that subsided after a few minutes.
It happens standing or sitting.
There appears to be no rhyme or reason to it.
The one thing I can add is that Sunday, three days ago, I missed all of my meds.
I just got mixed up.
I was fully back on schedule on Monday.
Anyone who has this issue, please let me know.
I am interested if it is associated with the Parkinson's side of LBD or another issue.
Pains don't usually scare me but this one, coupled with the LBD progression has me worried.
On a separate note, I have told you that my symptoms seem to be increasing in severity.
This pain has me thinking that the next chapter of LBD may not be as easy as the first.
In any case, you inputs would be appreciated.

I was sitting here in my computer room, looking over past posts.
Why, because I don't remember what I wrote for the most part.
Sad but true.
In any case, as I looked over my postings I realized that the last 6 months have been a roller coaster ride of symptoms, problems, and doctors.
There have been good days and some not so good.
My symptoms have been better some days and worse others.
Just like the symptoms of Lewy Body Dementia.
I say that, not to stick my finger in my neurologist's eye or any of my doubters, but as an affirmation of good research.
I can doubt my own illness and the diagnosis of numerous doctors on the days I feel good.
So it is good to know that I am not going crazy, it is LBD that is changing it's mind as ofter as a two year old.
Understanding that is the key to dealing with this disease.
I am convinced that this roller coaster ride will continue for the foreseeable future and that the big hills are yet to come.
But, understanding what I have and how it acts is the best defense for me.
If I know what I face, I can understand my issues, and not be frightened.
That is why I pushed for an exact diagnosis and that is why I can deal with this in such a positive manner.
Thanks to all of you who support me in the many ways that you do.

Over the last few days I have learned and demonstrated that my social filters no longer work like they used too.
I looked at the Lewy Body Dementia Association web sight and it is a documented symptom.
I know my Neurologist will say; I was expecting this!
She said the same thing when I acted out a dream in my sleep and punched my wife in the head!
The fact is, parts of my brain are malfunctioning due to the effects of this disease.
Just like my problems with memory, my brain is showing more and more effects of Lewy Body Dementia.
While I am concerned about this, I am not upset because I know it is a normal part of LBD.
However, people that I interact with don't understand this fact.
I have thought that maybe, I should buy a T-shirt that says; The person wearing this shirt has Dementia!
Or, the person wearing this shirt is subject to loud, emotional outbursts for no apparent reason!
I can't wait to see the look on someones face when they see that T-shirt on me.
I am not making excuses for my actions, but I am asking for understanding.
Loosing my temper is wrong, but there are mitigating circumstances.
So, I continually work on my emotional actions and pray that I will be civil, courteous, and polite to everyone I come in contact with.

My Lewy Body Dementia has "Progressed" to a new lower level.
I am having more stiffness, difficulty walking, jerking in my legs, and increased memory issues.
My walking has shifted more to a shuffle unless I really get going.
I also had the recent anger issues that I discussed before.
Those issues seem to be staying with me, much to my wife's dismay.
All of the issues are beginning to weigh me down.
My LBD has ran along at a stable level for some time, but now it seems to be accelerating.
While some people are negatively impacted by these events, I am not.
I have actually felt like I was waiting for the other shoe to fall for quite some time and it has been unnerving!
I get upset, as I have written before, with people who tell me; "You are not sick!
You look normal!
I forget things too!"
They are all trying to marginalize what is wrong with me because they are uncomfortable with my disease.
I saw an article about Glen Campbell's recent statements about his Alzheimer's Disease.
His wife said keeping him singing his music helped him retain his memory.
My statement to my wife centered around his wife's selfishness.
Her desire to keep Glenn "normal".
To keep that "shoe" in the air.
Well, I will not try to talk for Mr. Campbell, but for me, I want my LBD to progress and finish!
Can you imagine living with a tooth ache that the dentist could not fix, drugs would not subdue, and you could not get away from?
Well, that's how I feel.
My legs, arms, shoulders are stiff and hurt.
I can't sleep at night.
I see, hear and feel things that are not there.
I am suspicious of people  and I am angry at things that I probably should not be.
I am even having problems writing this blog.
My attention span is so short that I have problems concentrating.
And don't let me forget that my "Social Filters" are now so broke that I say anything to anyone.
I am not the man I once was, in so many ways.
All of these changes effect ME more than anyone else because I know better than anyone else that I am different.
My mind does not work like it used too and that effects everything else.
Ten years ago, I had the ascending half of my colon removed because of a tumor.
No big deal.
The surgery was relatively uneventful and I recovered and went back to work.
Maybe not as strong as before but good.
The only real side effect was that I went to the bathroom way more than before.
But, that made sense, I had half of the storage capacity.
Now, thanks to my LBD I suffer from constipation!
Try that with a 50% smaller tank!!
So, as I said, I really want the other shoe to drop.
Let's get this show on the road.
I am ready.

In the Navy, it was always said; "One aw shit wipes out 100 compliments!"
Actually, the last term was at-a-boys, but I thought I would loose you with that one.
Yesterdays anger out burst is certainly the "aw shit" in my week.
I was doing fairly well.
Cruising along as it was.
I even went out alone to get a haircut at the Exchange and do a couple of errands.
That was Thursday and even though I was emotionally drained when I returned home after 3 hours away, I felt like I was going to have a few good days.
Then, the anger out burst happened and I am again questioning my position in the progression of my disease.
So is my wife.
Yes, we did one too many things yestrday, but I get tired of not accomplishing things and we had to go to the Commissary in prepare for our family's visit.
But this event has shaken me to the core.
I woke up at approximately 1AM having a fight dream and violently punching my wife's pillow.
She woke me up, probably after she retrieved her catcher's mask.
This has been a difficult pill to swallow and frankly I am choking on it.
I am going to try to go back to sleep.
However, I am not done beating myself up over my lack of self-control.

<doc date=Friday, July 8, 2011>
OK, I am calmed down now and I do have some information from today's doctor's appointment that I wanted to discuss.
As you may remember, my Neurologist sent me to a Psychiatrist to address my hallucination issues and to further solidify the LBD diagnosis.
Why she wants to keep looking at the diagnosis, time and time again, is beyond me.
If you look at any of the information on LBD, I fit the mold exactly.
But, she wanted one more input, so I went.
The Psychiatrist tried me on a drug that was of the family that caused me anger issues before.
That problem is consistent with LBD, and this time, I actually had more issues with the drug than before.
So, it  is a lead pipe cinch that I have LBD and no one can deny that.
Today's uncontrolled fit if rage is also a sign that this disease is progressing.
So, what's next?
I know why my Neurologist, who I really do like and respect, has been so reticent to diagnose.
Why, because it has a definite life expectancy.
The average is 2-7 years with the outside edge of 20 years.
I probably have had this disease for 2-3 years so we are passed the 2 year limit.
And the health of the patient is s big determination on the life expectancy.
But, this definite diagnosis is exactly what I wanted.
To know what I actually have and to know what the prognosis is gives me closure.
Some folks may not like this definite diagnosis, but I do.
Tell me what I have, how we deal with it, and how long I have.
So, now we have it.
I hope my Neurologist is happy because I am done with looking under rocks for the phantom diagnosis.
We have Lewy Body Dementia, there is a time limit, and we will deal with that.
I am in relatively good shape still, and I have a good attitude, so those factors are in my favor.
I will deal with the challenges as they happen and not borrow worries from the future.
This will take as long as it takes, and I am OK with that.
I feel at rest and confident in this diagnosis.

I write a blog about my Navy days that I truly enjoy.
I have written many stories from my active duty and civil service days from memory.
And that has been good for me.
It has enhanced my memories and has given me pleasure.
My wife and my Neurologist both encouraged me to continue the blog as long as I could.
Well, we are reaching the end of the road.
You see, I am having more and more difficulty remembering my past!
Up t now, I had very good recall of the past.
It was the short term memory that I had issues with.
No more!
Now I can't remember the past.
I remember parts of stories, but the majority of the story just is not there.
I feel like I am looking into an empty container!
I know something is supposed to be there, but I can't find it.
Is this temporary?
I doubt it.
I think this is the next step.
I have felt diminished in my mental and physical capabilities for the last week or so and that coincides with my inability to recall the past.
So, what do I do?
Live with it.
There is no alternative.
So, if you read my Navy blog;  "The Master Chief's Lair", I may be slow in my posts.
But I will keep trying.
That's me.

I wrote earlier about my second visit to the Psychiatrist.
He is a good doctor and he listens to me.
I guess that's what shrinks do.
But, he conveys a sense of caring and I trust him.
I previously had a bad reaction to a group of medications that lead my Neurologist to the Lewy Body Dementia diagnosis.
Well, that bad reaction and every other symptom listed for Lewy Body Dementia.
A blind man on a galloping horse could have diagnosed that one!!
But, just the same, the Psychiatrist wanted me to try a drug in that family to try to deal with my hallucinations.
Because I like him, I tried the drug.
But let me be clear, my hallucinations don't bother me.
I am not frightened by them, and sometimes they amuse me.
I will admit, the first person I saw startled me.
But the dog did not bark, so I figured he was not there.
As long as I have the dog, I figure I am OK.
Right?!
I took the pills for 3 weeks, and the same problems happened, plus a few.
What symptoms?
Mean, argumentative, grouchy, can't sleep at night, constipation, did I mention grouchy and mean!
My wife finally took me off the pills and after a few days, I was back to normal.
Well, as normal as I get these days.
Let's just say I am manageable.
So, what did we learn from this little pharmaceutical experiment.
I have Lewy Body Dementia.
Don't give me drugs from that family unless you want a grouchy old man on your ass with a memory disorder and a bad attitude!

<doc date=Monday, June 27, 2011>
Let me tell you a true story.
Last month, my wife and I decided to take a big car trip.
We used the computer and mapped out a route through several states, to see recently found relatives in two states and an old Navy shipmate.
I made a hotel reservation at the Holiday Inn Express, Grand Island, Nebraska using Expedia.
Then, the next day, after sleeping on the idea, we decided 3 weeks on the road would be too taxing for me, for obvious reasons.
So, we tried to cancel the reservations through Expedia.
They said NO, because it was an nonrefundable reservation!!
I called the Holiday Inn Express and they said the same thing, only in a much more disrespectful tone.
I have called Expedia three times, talked to some reasonably nice people at their call center in Manila, PI with nothing more than an "I'm sorry".
This is a $134.00 lesson in don't use Expedia.
Even my credit card company told me to suck eggs!
But wait it gets better.
We decided that we still wanted to see this one, newly discovered, 96 year old cousin, on my wife's side, in a deep southern state that floods every time someone spills  glass of water.
So, we made air reservations, but this time, I decided to go straight to through airline, Delta.
I used their site and it did tell me it was an nonrefundable ticket, so I bought the trip insurance, another $66.00 per ticket.
Then the Cousin got sick, supposedly with walking pneumonia.
She wanted us to delay our trip to August.
No problem, I have trip insurance.
Ney, Ney!
It does not cover sick cousins!!!
So, I had to pay $150 per ticket to change the reservations!!
I am betting the trip gets canceled in August so I can write off the other $1500 in airplane tickets and make it a trifecta!!
I really don't want to travel anymore.
It is just too taxing on me.
Yes, I like to go see my Son and his family, and I like to go to Cleveland and see my family there, but those are known destinations with known beds to sleep in.
But travel to strange places on airplanes, sleeping in hotels, is no longer a good idea for me.
Not to mention that there are companies out there ready to rip you off every time you give them a chance.
Do I want you to boycott Expedia and Delta, that's up to you.
But I will never do business with either company again.
I explained my medical issues to both companies, was completely honest, and they took my money.
OK, they win.
But I learned a lesson.
I just wish it did not cost me $2000!

After my second visit to the psychiatrist, I had a new pill to take.
It is of the same family as the one I took a while ago that caused me to be so mean that I actually got is an argument with my Pastor.
That reaction was the deciding factor in my diagnosis of Lewy Body Dementia (LBD).
The Doctor said he was confident this medicine would not cause that negative effect.
Wrong!!
I am as grumpy as a rattlesnake on a hot day!!
Second issue, I cannot sleep, day or night!
My legs hurt, my back and shoulders hurt, and there is no place on the bed that I am comfortable.
When I do get to sleep, my dreams wake me up.
Last night, I woke myself up after less than an hours sleep, violently tossing and turning.
I actually flop over so hard it shakes the bed.
I truly don't know why.
My Church had it's annual yard sale today.
I usually stand by the road and flag customers in, by acting silly!
Hey, it works so you can't argue with success.
This year, I was so unstable on my feet that my wife made me quit my efforts.
She was afraid I would fall into the street!
She was probably correct.
I have also noticed my memory and my alertness have taken a turn for the worse.
So, with the increased instability, the increased muscle pain, and the decrease in alertness and memory function, it is apparent that I have taken the next step in the progression of my LBD.
I see the change and so does my wife and others around me.
I know it bothers my bride and my friends, but I am still ambivalent about it.
I just don't worry about this disease.
It will be what ever it is and I can't change that.
I will keep you informed.

One of my pleasures in life is finding old friends and shipmates.
But I have found out that Some folks don't want to be found and others don't want to be associated with someone with a terminal disease.
Trust me, it's not contagious!
I have tried to figure out the motivation behind those people who were once my friends, not wanting to rekindle our friendship.
One reason I can come up with is that I was a drunk in the old days.
I drank for pleasure and I drank until I was drunk.
Some folks may have found that a problem, but most of us did it.
I, however, have stopped being a drunk for over 12 years!
I have completely changed and I am much happier.
Another reason I can come up with is that I represent something in their past that they don't want to relive.
I would not want to cause anyone problems.
The third reason I came up with is some folks may have something to hide.
But that one is pure speculation.
I am looking for the pleasure of getting reacquainted with old friends.
Catching up on their lives, Seeing how their children grew up.
I have connected with a number of old friends and have had a good time reminiscing.
I hope others will allow me the same opportunities with them.
I will admit that I gain much more pleasures from the past than I do in the present.
My dreams, my day dreams, my ego, the things that make me smile are based in my past.
That connection will only grow deeper as my Lewy Body Dementia progresses.
I know this, and others should too.

My wife and I just had a short but interesting discussion that did not end with an answer, but just more thought;  When do I quit taking all of the meds that I take?
I have already stopped Sinemet, as I discussed in an earlier post.
We know, from doing research, that Namenda and Razadyne (Arecept) have a limited time that they are effective.
So, when do we quit taking medications and just let the disease take it's course?
A cancer patient certainly does not continue chemo therapy after the Oncologist has decided that the treatment will no longer help.
SO why would I take medicines, designed to help my memory when they have stopped working.
We will certainly know when they stop working because my memory will begin a precipitous drop.
I also need to tell you that I am not at that point now.
However, I also am smart enough to know that someday I will be.
Also, my Neurologist has me on some herbal remedies that she has learned help with the effectiveness of Namenda and Razadyne.
If I quit taking all of these meds, my pill box would shrink by 90%.
Not to mention my payments to the pharmacy!
And of course, there is the practical matter of, how long do I want to prolong the inevitable?
Don't everyone get all upset.
I am just looking at this in a practical manner.
To say that I am tired of taking pills would be an understatement.
They are beginning to replace food!
I take 12 pills at night!!
That has replaced my nightly snack!
After the pills I don't have enough room for my ice cream!!
How bad is that?
So, as usual, Lewy Body Dementia has left us with more questions than answers.
I guess we will just have to keep looking for guidance from GOD.

I write a blog about my Navy days that is very important to me and a source of therapy for me.
But tonight at a meeting at Church, I realized just how much I wanted my past to live on.
I had a wonderful career with the U.S.Navy.
The Navy took me from a juvenile delinquent to a leader of men and that transformation and the experiences I had are the sum total of me.
I was discussing some of my Navy experiences and I commented on my son's desire to know more about my past and the opposite desires of my grand sons.
But someday, when I cannot relate my experiences, they will want to know and I want those experiences there for them.
Also, I still have knowledge about leadership and Navy tradition to give back to today's sailors.
But, most of all, it makes me feel alive, valuable!
I watched my Father-in-law suffer the terrible effects of Alzheimer's.
I watched as he retreated into his Army days, a time he was very comfortable with.
I believe I am also experiencing that regression.
I am happier, more comfortable, and more engaged when I am talking about my Navy days.
My dreams are mostly about my Navy days and my thoughts through the day regress to my Navy days.
I am not complaining, just reporting something I am noticing.
I have approached my LBD with a "Trouble Shooters" perspective.
I look at changes in my progress as "Interesting".
So, this slow but noticeable change is indeed interesting to me.
</doc>
<doc date=Monday, June 13, 2011>
I am more coherent tonight and I wanted to write about my Parkinson's symptoms.
Last night I was not mentally connected.
Maybe my computer needs a "Mentally connected" lock much like a breath test lock on a car ignition switch to prevent drunk driving.
Some time ago, I stopped, with my wife's and my Neurologist's approval, taking Sinemet.
That drug caused me terrible nausea and the longer I took it, my ability to manage that side effect diminished until I was not taking doses just to not have the dry heaves.
The Neurologist told me the symptoms would come back and she was right.
In the evenings, my legs are painfully stiff and cramped.
I have difficulty walking and I have balance issues.
My other major muscles, arms, neck, upper back, also experience pain in the evening.
When I wake in the morning, I seem to be better.
I attribute that to relaxing in a prone position and taking the stress off of these supportive muscles.
That's my theory.
I also have noticed more shaking when I try to put tooth paste on my tooth brush, or when I attempt other fine motor skills.
Even typing and moving the mouse for the computer becomes a challenge in the evening.
Again, I attribute this to my Lewy Body Dementia.
This change in my Parkinsonian Symptoms aggravates me and I find that, for the first time, I am angry that I have this disease.
For many years, I had a wonderful ability to mentally combat medical and mental issues.
During deployments, I could think ahead to my home coming and calm my anxieties.
Now, I have lost that ability and I only see the progression of the disease.
While that is the truth and my reality, it still angers me.
Since this is a new emotion, concerning my present condition, I thought it was a good idea to record it and ask for feed back from my online support group.

<doc date=Sunday, June 12, 2011>
I have a follow up visit with the Psychiatrist this week.
My first visit went OK as I said before.
He was not judgemental and listened.
I guess he was trained to do that!
He thought that I was depressed and increased the dosage of my depression medicine.
I told him and all of you that I am not depressed.
The evidence of that is, the increase in meds did nothing for my mood, sleeping, desire to do things, or inner peace.
Like I said, I am not depressed.
The way I feel is a product of Lewy Body Dementia.
All you have to do is go to WEBMD and look at the symptoms of LBD.
As I have said for years;  A blind man on a galloping horse could see that!
But, that's why they call in "Practicing" medicine.
On another note, I read another LBD blog, I believe the title is "Living with a thief called Lewy.
It is a great Blog from the care giver's prospective and has provided me much valuable first hand knowledge of my condition.
Unlike having a broken arm or a pending root canal, people with LBD or other dementia disorders have few sources of first hand experience to draw on.
We are blessed to have "Living with a thief called Lewy" to learn from.
Now, if I got the title wrong, GOOGLE Lewy Body Dementia blogs and "Living with a thief.
I may have the title slightly wrong, after all, my memory is not perfect.
In any case, I read in this blog that the husband, the one with LBD, stays up at night and raids the refrigerator.
Me too!
As I have said before, nights are not my friend, as you may be able to tell from the time of this writing.
I spend many lonely hours playing Freecell or Solitare on the computer, jumping at every sound, seeing things that are not there, unable to sleep.
It is good to know this is "normal" in our world.
Fear is something relatively new to me.
In my Navy career, my career field did not lend itself to fear.
Working around things that naturally blow up and kill people requires a good deal of self-confidence and self-assurance.
Now, I am frightened by shadows, dark, financial issues, and the immediate future.
I am not afraid to die.
I am afraid what will happen between now and when I die.
The unknown is frightening to me and that is another reason I stay in my safety zone.
Enough ramblings for now.
Back to Freecell.
See, there's nothing wrong with me, I know rambling when I see it.

<doc date=Saturday, May 28, 2011>
More and more, I want to be alone!
Some of you say it is because I am depressed.
I do not agree.
The psychiatrist I saw last week had the same opinion, but I still disagree.
He is wrong, I am not depressed.
I do not want to harm myself.
I do not feel worthless.
I just feel safe, unthreatened, comfortable, in my familiar surroundings.
I know where things are, I can control access to my world, I don't have to meet other people's standards of dress, grooming, chatter.
I can play solitaire on my computer and retreat into a safe cocoon.
I will admit I have lost my desire to be in crowds, to be social, to do things, but I am not depressed.
When I want company, I go out.
Shopping, walking, to dinner, whatever.
I enjoy canoeing with my Wife.
I enjoy walking in the quiet of the morning or evening.
I enjoy being alone with my thoughts and my memories.
Please don't try to label my actions or try to analyze me.
Look at WEBMD.
This IS Lewy Body Dementia.
In the beginning of my struggle, I was more able to be the way I was.
Then for a season, I tried to be the way that I was.
Now, I have quit trying.
I am what I am, as Popeye said.
I believe he was right!
Or, as a friend who is the In Service Engineering Agent for the diesels on the MCM class mine Sweepers says;  "It is what it is."
Those are both good descriptions of how I am doing right now.

This disease is turning me into a hermit!
I have lost my desire to go out and be social.
I have known this, in theory, for a while.
But today, during my first appointment with the psychiatrist, I actually understood that I was a hermit!!
Before the LBD, I was a very extroverted, gregarious, person who thrived on crowds, people, and gatherings.
Now, my wife who is an extreme introvert, has to schedule any social gathering and drag me out of the house.
The real sad and disturbing part is, I am comfortable just being home, alone.
One positive thing, if there is anything positive, is that the psychiatrist told my wife and I that my hallucinations, the memory problems, the changes in my personality, are not psychiatric or in my mind, but are neurological and related to my disease.
That is comforting to me.
</doc>
<doc date=Friday, May 20, 2011>
I have always enjoyed meeting new people.
I enjoy the interaction with people.
What I don't enjoy is the reaction I get from people when I tell them I have Lewy Body Dementia.
Most people deny that I have the disease.
In most cases, in a mostly polite way, they call me a liar!
So, I try to put on a "show".
That facade is one of a normal person, someone without LBD.
That "Lie" causes me stress.
That argument within me causes a mixed emotional problem that has been upsetting to me for quite a while.
But today, I met a person that treated me like a person who was telling the truth and it was liberating!
That person lives in our "over 55" apartment complex and is a  registered Nurse that works with memory impaired people.
I met her walking my dog.
She was walking her dog also and they seemed to get along.
As the dogs discussed their day, she and I began to get to know each other.
As we talked, she began to ask questions that only a person very familiar with LBD would ask.
After what seemed like a few minutes, she was telling me to let my wife know she was there to help if we ever needed her.
That acceptance of me and my disease was liberating and it was the first time that anyone has really accepted me and my issues.
She never said, "You look fine", or "you don't have anything wrong with you".
I have been told that everyone has the issues that you have, and that they are just part of ageing.
That is just not so, and they know that.
So, I have to believe that they are uncomfortable with someone with a degenerative neurological disease that leads to death.
Either that or they just enjoy causing me pain.
Today was a good day.
I decided it's OK to be sick.
I decided it's OK to have LBD.
And, I decided it's OK not to try to please others by pretending that I am something that I am not, that is normal.
I am me, a man with Lewy Body Dementia.
A man with a memory disorder and other mental issues that effect me mentally and physically.
A man who still has much to give, but may need some help remembering what that is.

<doc date=Tuesday, May 10, 2011>
I know I have written about this problem before, but it is truly getting worse.
I can actually feel myself getting emotionally wound up, angry, depressed, and restless, as soon as the sun starts to set.
Anything can set me off and it is all that I can do to keep my powerful emotions under control.
I certainly do not want to get angry with my wife.
She is innocent.
But I am not good company after dark.
I drift from the computer room to the living room and back.
Solitaire of Free cell on the computer tend to calm me, but I tire of them quickly.
I really don't want to do anything, noise, voices, motion, anything agitates me.
Looking forward to going to sleep is not a pleasant thought either.
If I do sleep, I dream constantly all night.
Never good dreams.
Mostly frightening and sometimes horrifying dreams.
Sometimes I wake to hallucinations.
Sometimes I just wake up and get up, spending hours at the computer.
This is really beginning to bother me and I don't know what to do.
I have some meds to take, and I do, every night.
But, they don't seem to take the edge off.
I have an appointment with a Psychiatrist the end of this month, at the bequest of my Neurologist.
Maybe he can help.
We will see.
My worry is that nights will be my down fall and the reason I am institutionalized someday.
Again, we will see.

One of the ear marks of Lewy Body Dementia is the syndrome of, "OK today and terrible tomorrow".
Really, one day, I feel OK.  Not great, and worse than I did a year ago or so, but still, better than I feel most of the time.
Then the next day, I am in a daze, disoriented, overwhelmed with life, people, noise, and I am overcome with the desire to do nothing!
The idea of leaving the apartment is more than I can bear.
People are caustic to me, and I am mad at the world.
Since I am so dependent on my routine, part of me wishes my disease would stabilize and I would feel the same, or decreasing everyday.
I realize that is not the way LBD works, and I really do enjoy the good days.
But, I also know, somewhere around the corner,  lurks a bad day just waiting for me to be too comfortable with the good days.
Ready to pounce on me and make me feel terrible, grouchy, depressed, and confused.
Along with this, my neurologist and I agreed, two weeks ago, to have me stop taking Sinemet.
I took this for the Parkinson's symptoms, and it worked.
But the medicine makes me nauseous and that problem was increasing.
So, we stopped Sinemet and now my legs and arms ache.
Not terribly, but noticeably, especially at night.
My legs actually feel like thy are drawing up towards my body.
I stretch, and that helps.
I also depend on my cane more than ever and get tired quickly when walking.
I even use the elevator in our apartment building.
Before, I used the stairs to get some exercise.
But now, most of the time, my legs feel weak and the stairs are a big challenge.
I do not want to go back on the Sinemet, so I WILL find ways to deal with these issues.
The pain is better than having the "Dry Heaves" every 6 hours.
If you ask me today, how this disease is progressing, I would say, that is is gaining in speed and power.
But tomorrow, I may feel like I have the upper hand.
Today, I am tired, jumpy, mentally disoriented, and very overwhelmed.
Tomorrow, I may want to be with people, have a clear understanding of my surroundings, and not be such a grouch.
At least, I hope so.
I don't mean to sound so negative, but I use this blog to keep friends and family informed of my progress.
I also use it as a mental outlet for me.
Both serve a needed role in my life.
Some of my friends and family are out of state.
Some folks are reticent to ask how I am doing, because I normally say; "OK" when I really would like to tell them what is really going on.
But, I ramble.
I will keep you all informed.
Hoping for a better day tomorrow.

This week, our best friends took my wife and I out for a very pleasant day to celebrate my upcoming birthday.
We had a wonderful time at the Chrysler Museum and a great lunch at a local Mexican restaurant.
As the lunch progressed we began to discuss the stresses in our lives.
I made a statement that I have never made before but should have.
My best friend is dealing with his own progressive disease.
In any case, the discussion turned to the recent stress in our lives and I stated, without reservation, that my friend and I were the reason for our wives stress!
It is true!
We are both long time married couples.
Our wives are totally devoted to us and have made numerous sacrifices over the years, especially when you realize the demands of being a Navy wife.
Now, when we are supposed to be planning our "golden years" our wives are dealing with diseases that very well may shorten our lives and drastically diminish the quality of life of us and our spouses.
That potential for a shortened life span and decreased quality of life is causing extreme stress for our spouses!
There are a number of models relating to the stages of grief that one goes through relating to the a spouses death.
All of them start out with denial and then progress to anger.
There  are a number of models for the further steps, but none of them deal directly with the stress that one experiences in this situation.
Yet, here we are, two long time married couples, dealing with the same realities, but never really, truly addressing the stress that are building at an alarming rate in all of us.
It is effecting the health of our spouses, their quality of life, and their future way of life.
I do not have an answer to this issue, nor do I really think there is one.
I do know that honestly, openly facing the issues helps.
All of us need to speak our minds, express our feelings, and let ourselves grieve.
Yes, I said grieve.
Unlike a sudden death of a spouse,  living with a spouse that has a terminal disease is tantamount to living with constant death.
Every time you look at the one you love, it must cross you mind that this may be the last kiss, the last vacation, the last holiday.
That is the making for a serious case of stress overload!
Again, other than honesty,  I don't have a solution.
But, I do know that while I unwittingly stated the obvious, I am going to pay attention to my wife's emotions and those of my best friend and his wife.
We have been friends for over 30 years, we understand each other, share life's memories, survived numerous deployments, transfers, and will survive this, together.
There is strength in friendship and I am glad I have such a real wife ans such dedicated friends.

If you have followed this Blog at all, you must have seen a few examples of my attempt to laugh at the things that happen as a by product of LBD.
Some things are down right funny!
I realize that I have written some angry and "down" postings, but I really do find humor in my everyday living.
Lately my memory has taken a marked turn for the worse.
You may remember my search for the garage door opener or as I call it, the remote control.
I found that in a light bulb box, in a closed plastic stowage box, in the bottom of the linen closet.
How it got there, I don't know.
But now, I think it's funny.
Just a few minutes ago, my wife and I were sharing a story about our outing to the Native American Pow-Wow held at our local park built on a mountain of garbage with grass on it.
True!!
As she told me the story and stated that I would always remember the circumstances, I began to laugh, because I know that I WILL forget the circumstances, and I thought that was funny.
You just can't take this too seriously.
Come to think of it, people take themselves too seriously.
That's why there is so much depression, so many suicides, so many strokes, so many divorces.
Lighten up people!
I had an Executive Officer on the USS Stein that said, "Navy is supposed to be fun.
If you are not having fun, you are doing something wrong!"
I agreed with the XO then and I agree with him now.
LIFE is supposed to be fun!
Yes, there are responsibilities, but if you live right, they take care of themselves.
I refuse to let my illness dictate how I feel.
Yes, sometimes I am reclusive, depressed, and overwhelmed.
But I still strive to fine humor in my life, even if it is at my expense.

Almost sounds like the title of a Day Time Drama or a Soap Opera if you are of a certain age.
But it is not, it is life, as we who are afflicted with LBD or any other degenerative neurological disease understand.
As this disease progresses and picks up steam, I still marvel at it's effect on my way of life.
It seems that the old Tech Rep and trouble shooter in me likes to look at this experience from afar.
It is interesting to evaluate the effects on my life, from a detached prospective.
I wonder if others take this approach or I am completely strange.
What effects, there are the expected ones with confusion, inability to learn new things, and even the hallucinations.
But, for me, there have been some unexpected issues.
I lived my life as an extreme extrovert.
I loved being in constant contact with people, in crowds, one on one, telephone calls, visitors, any way of being in contact.
I loved making speeches, Navy retirements, ceremonies,  teaching, meetings, and preaching.
Today, while I still like to be with people, I can only handle it in small doses for short periods of time.
Why, because I get exhausted trying to keep up with the conversation.
Crowds used to give me energy, now they zap my energy, quickly.
I avoid making telephone calls and with the exception of Church, almost completely avoid large gatherings.
Physical energy is another issue I am dealing with much earlier than I thought I would.
Last Saturday, we went to a local park, not 2 miles from our home, to observe a Native American Pow-Wow.
It was magnificent.
I am intrigued by the Native American culture, but I was completely exhausted at the end of 3 hours and came home and slept for 5 hours!
Not so long ago, I could have gone all day and all night.
Now, my dear wife has to balanced time, and my exposure to people to make sure I am not worn out.
A third surprise is my desire for complete isolation.
I really do not want to leave our home.
I am secure, staying in our home or in the apartment complex, all the time.
The things I used to enjoy and seek out, I no longer have a desire to do.
Yes, If my wife plans an event, I enjoy it.
But she has to take the initiative, I will not.
The last thing I will address today is travel.
Travel completely exhausts me.
I used to love to drive for hours.
After my son and family moved to up state New York, we would visit them ofter and I would seldom relinquish the driving duties to my wife.
The last trip, she did the majority of the driving.
Why, because I have to concentrate so much to drive the car, I get tired quickly.
What used to be automatic to me is now an effort.
Then there is the sensory overload of the trip itself.
This last trip took me three days to recover from.
I was OK with that, because all I did was sleep, but that concerns my wife and makes her worry.
My efforts on this blog and my other two, keeps me engaged as much as I want to be.
I can write on the topics I feel moved to write on and have no demands from you, my readers.
No one has written me and berated me for not writing enough.
May that should worry me.
But it does not.
I realize my execution of the English language is sometime off.
And I notice that even "spell check" has troubles with some of my word spellings.
But these endeavors still give me pleasure and psychological stimulation.
I appreciate all of you who read these musings and I really appreciate you replies.
I will keep writing and telling my story as long as GOD permits.

My last Neurologist visit was less than satisfactory.
She seemed uninterested in my case, disconnected, and pre-occupied.
Sine I am suffering from a degenerative neurological disease, I am suspicious, even when there is no reason to be.
So, I was unhappy with the visit and I may have over reacted.
I was ready to stop all medications, and give up.
Then I was ready to find another doctor.
Then I was just going to quit.
My wife, being of a more calm nature, convinced me to get another appointment with my Neurologist and lay my cards on the table.
Today was the day.
We had an 8:15 AM appointment, and were there early.
We had our ducks in a row and were ready to discuss all of our concerns.
When the doctor came into the room, I could see that she was herself again.
But, with my wife taking the lead, because I no longer can take confrontation, we calmly and slowly presented our complaints.
She saw value in some of our issues and seemed shocked by some others.
She apologized for the misunderstanding and we let her know that we really trusted her and needed her help.
Then, we all came to an agreement on my diagnosis.
Now, I have a foe to fight and I have a name for that enemy.
Just as the 14 year old at UVA said, and I agreed with from my own research on WEBMD and other sights, I have Lewy Body Dementia.
My neurologist also wants the assistance of a Psychiatrist, to pin down my issues with hallucinations and violent dreams.
I can agree with that request and will soon see that professional.
I feel better knowing that we are all on the same track.
Some people may not want a solid diagnosis.
Some people may never want to know what they are facing.
The trouble shooter in me makes me want to know what the diagnosis is and what we can do to fight it!
That's me and now she know that.
We really did need to stand up and clear the air today.
It worked and I am glad that we did. 
</doc>
<doc date=Tuesday, April 12, 2011>
I have read all of the symptoms of Lewy Body Dementia.
WEB MD does a great job describing my disease and it's problems.
My neurologist is not forthcoming with future problems.
She prefers for me to "Discover" them on my own.
That's like a girl going into puberty without thorough, loving, training from her mother!
How do I know that?
Just trust me on this one.
In any case, I have mis-placed things before.
We all have.
I usually find them.
You know where they are, they are in the "last place you look".
That makes sense, why would you keep looking after you found the item that was lost!
But this time was different.
Let me explain.
I attend a Bible study every Monday night.
I have to be there at 6:00 PM to get my room set up.
Last Monday, as I was getting ready to leave, I could not find the garage door opener remote control.
This is a big issue, because, without it, I cannot open the garage door!
Remember, I live in an "over 55" apartment complex.
The garage is not connected to my home.
The door does not have keys, and the only way to open it is with the remote control.
Looking at that, maybe the management needs to look for an alternative.
I can't be the only person in this complex with memory issues!
Can I?
In any case, I had not used the remote control since we returned from Church on Sunday afternoon.
I do have a "place" where I always store the remote control, so I know where it is.
I have this system for everything.
My routine is very important to me.
But, this time, the remote control was not in it's appointed place.
My wife and I search all over the apartment.
In coat pockets, pants pockets, on the floor of my closet,  in the mail box, on the ground between the apartment and the garage, everywhere we could think of.
No remote control for the garage door opener.
Thankfully, my nephew was visiting and he offered me his rental car.
Yes, I still drive!
And well, I might add.
I made it to Bible study on time, but flustered.
The evening was "off" because of this disruption.
While I was gone, my wife and my nephew again searched the apartment.
Still, no remote control.
Upon my return, I looked again  in places I knew I was the day before, or really, places I thought I might have been since I really don't remember what I do from day to day.
After all this searching, being very overwhelmed with the loss of this device, I resigned myself to the fact that I would have to purchase a new one and have the management program it.
A few hours later, my wife asked me to get an extension cord out of the linen closet.
In my search for the extension cord, which we store in a plastic storage box in the bottom of the linen closet, along with the light bulbs, I discovered the remote control, in an open light bulb box!
I do not remember being in that box on Sunday or Monday.
I did not change any light bulbs that I, nor my wife, remember.
But, just the same, there it was.
I was relieved and frightened at the same time.
You see, this heralds the progression of my disease to a more troublesome level.
Yes, it was the first time, that I remember, putting something in a place it clearly does not belong.
But just the same, that is exactly what I did.
I have had a couple of days to forget what happened, and I am no longer upset over this event.
But, I am wary and I realize this will not be the last time.
However, I bet my wife looks in that plastic container the next time I mis-place something!

One of the attitudes that I notice in individuals experiencing my medical difficulties or other medical maladies is the attitude of VICTIMIZATION.
Many of these individuals seem to feel that they are victims of their disease.
As if "IT" sought them out personally, to ruin their lives and make them miserable.
I have also noticed that many of these individuals have been victims of someone else's mistreatment, meanness, prejudice, and wrath their entire lives.
They seem to be professional, life long victims.
I have heard 60+ year old people whine about how their parents mistreated them, how employers discriminated against them because of a previous medical or personality disorder, and how the world of successful people had conspired to make them miserable throughout their lives.Frankly, I have had enough of this self-pity and encourage all of these folks to GROW UP and get over it!
None of our parents were perfect.
There is no "Owner's Manual" for raising children.
They did the best they could, and if they were not "Ozzie and Harriett", tough, neither were mine.
Second, I believe we make our own "Lot" in life.
Maybe you were born into a "poor"  situation, that was 40, 50, 60+ years ago.
What did you do to improve your life?
Forget about the past, it is exactly that, PAST.
Third, you disease did not seek you out.
It just happened.
Maybe because of genetics, environment, being in the wrong place at the wrong time, or bad luck.
But, YOU make your own environment.
Deal with your medical issues as best you can and look for the bright spots.
Just because we have a medical condition does not mean we cannot have an enjoyable, full life.
But, acting like a victim and believing that you are WILL insure that you are miserable and in turn, will make everyone miserable around you.
I know many individuals that live in my complex that have life much worse than I do, and they are happy, vibrant, individuals with a zest for life!For just once, in your life, try to look at the bright side!
Quit blaming someone else and take charge of your own life's circumstances.
When you are so glum and negative, you make everyone else unhappy as well as yourselves.
Did you ever wonder why no one comes to visit you or wants to be around you?
It's you self pity and your victimization attitude.
Get over it, for you sake and mine!

As many of you know, I am a career Navy enlisted man who was brought up in the Navy, in the 1960's and 70s.
I was in a career field that was dangerous and where fear was a definite weakness that could and would be exploited.
Therefore, I learned to suppress fear to the point of non-existence.
Yes, there are things that I feared.
But, I killed them if I could or avoided them all together.
Like snakes, spiders, and scorpions.
I have been a self-assured, aggressive, loud, take charge person for all of my adult life.
On my other Blog, I discuss some of the events in my Navy career that shaped me and the men who had great influence on me.
So, I won't retrace those events here.
However, as my disease progresses, I am becoming more and more afraid.
I am easily startled.
To make matters worse, I have, and have had for quite some time, hallucinations that are increasing in frequency and realism.
My visual hallucinations have progressed from small creatures running across the floor to people.
I have even seen "something" speed by me while stopped at a stop light at an intersection.
There was nothing, I know that, but I also know what I saw.
I continue to feel someone touching me, and of course, there is no  one there.
Many times I hear voices, that are not there.
If I am with someone, like my wife, I can talk to that person and my fears are relieved.
Today, while my wife was at a Bible study and I was alone at home, I heard my wife's voice talking and the front door rattling.
I was in the office and I knew she was not due home yet.
She is always careful to let me know where she will be and when she will be home.
This helps me and she knows it.
In any case, today's auditory hallucination scared me!
My heart was racing and my "Fight of Flight" reflexes were at peak alert.
It took me until my wife came home to calm down.
Rationally, after the first 5 minutes, I knew it was a hallucination, but that did not help me calm down.
I told my wife upon her arrival home, and I felt better.
But now, I am worried that soon,I may not be able to stay home alone, or go out alone on my own!
This upsets me for the obvious reasons.
I have been an independent, action oriented, combat ready sailor for a long time, and the thought, the reality, of that going away is daunting and depressing to me.
The person I was, is dying, and I don't like it.

I have written a few time about my frustrations with my Neurologist and the 13 year old neurologist at UVA.
My last appointment with my neurologist frustrated me to the point, that I have finally decided to change neurologists.
Remember, if you will, that I really like my GP.
He is pro-active, caring, and can communicate!
He is a real find and I have been with him for 15 years.
In any case, I have been looking for a new doctor to treat my Lewy Body Dementia and I think I have found the perfect one!
His prices are acceptable to my insurance company, he has very good office hours and makes house calls!
I can tell he thinks more about his patients than himself because of his attire and modes of transportation.
He is a happily married man, a parent, and a teacher on the side.
He shares interests with me,  outdoor sports, re-enacting, fire arms, knives, horse back riding, and archery.
He is all American and can trace his family roots back to the beginning of this continent.
Yes, I believe I have found the perfect doctor to help me deal with my LBD.Oh, you want his name, and where he studied medicine.
The second does not seem to be too important to success since the last two neurologists I saw had degrees from the Ivy League medical schools and had the caring attitude of a female Preying Mantis.
Just the same, His name is Chief Falling Rain.
He was educated by his father who was also a medicine man in the Lakota tribe of the Sioux Nation.
As a matter of fact, most of his descendants have been in the medical field.
So he has a wealth of experience at his disposal.
He is caring, does not tell me I am faking my illness, and offers constructive ways to deal with my issues.
Yesterday I spent eight hours in a sweat lodge to cleanse my body and spirit.
I am loosing weight, my acne has cleared up, and I thing my bald spot is starting to fill in!
Yes, I think this is going to work!

OK, maybe the title should be; Everyone, everything, makes me angry!
At least that is where I have been the last number of days, weeks, months, I can't remember.
In any case, we went to see my Neurologist yesterday.
It was my usual, planned, every four months visit.
The same inane questions, the same motor skills test, the same stuff!
When I ask questions about my progress, the future, I don't get a straight answer.
I realize she is a busy doctor, but those 30 minutes are mine.
My insurance and my money paid for them.
I should expect reasonable attention and service, right?
It may be me, but I get the feeling that every time I go to see her, I have to prove that I am afflicted with this disease that she and another doctor, along with two PHD Psychologists, told me I have and prescribed tons of medicine for.
Not to mention that this Neurologist filled out forms and a letter that got me a disability retirement from the Federal Office of Personnel Management, (OPM) and the Social Security Administration, on the first application!..
No lawyers, no appeals, no delays!
So why do I have to prove that I am sick every four months!!
I am so depressed and upset over this that I am seriously thinking about stopping all of my medications and letting the cards fall where they may.
Last month, or the month before, there was a problem with the pharmacy and I was without my Arecept, (actually Razadyne, but most of you don't recognize that name) for four days and my wife and I noticed a decline in my cognitive abilities!
So, if I quit taking ALL of them for the next four months, she should have no problem recognizing that I have a problem, that SHE diagnosed!
Of course, I will be drooling on my shirt, pissing in my pants, and unable to respond to simple commands!
But, maybe that's what she wants.
In any case, as I said earlier, I am angry and searching for a way to deal with that anger.
Quitting seems to be my only recourse!

Hopefully you will remember that Linda and I have joined an Alzheimer's Association support program called EASE.
We meet every Friday and both of us look forward to that meeting.
We find the members of the group interesting, real, and genuinely concerned about each other.
The staff and the students, that are all working on PH D's in psychology, are helpful, full of information, and also concerned about our well being.
The person who is the prime mover is a geriatric specialist with considerable experience.
I find that individual a wealth of knowledge and understanding.
Today's meeting was about "Communications".
Yes, I know that i the business world, the military, and in academia, "Communications" is discussed by every consultant, professor, and success guru, that can write a self-published book!
But that was not what we discussed.
Instead, we discussed the problems with communication between those of you who are not diagnosed with a dementia related disease and those of us who are.
There is a real problem here and it is not the obvious one you think I am going to refer to.The speaker for today, also, a geriatric specialist with an advanced degree and a wealth of experience, told us that to communicate, both parties MUST accept the diagnosis!
I immediately agreed with that person, since I have run into and had run ins with, people who absolutely do not believe that I have dementia.
I have been called as much as a liar!
Now, I have been totally open with friends, family, and acquaintances, about my diagnosis and the struggle I am under going.
Yet, some people deny that I have a medical issue.
I have been told to get a day planner, get organized, work away from home, go back to work, and any number of prescriptions from non-medical people.
So, when that topic came up, I was ready to cheer.
But, the professional told us that the diagnosed person must also accept the diagnosis, and stop trying to be what they always were!
That took me by surprise.
I have told you in past postings, that I wear myself out, daily, trying to appear normal.
By the way, it no longer works.
This professional told us it was OK to let our symptoms show, and to stop trying to do that which we know that we can't.
That was a very liberating statement and one that I am going to take to heart.
I am not who I was two years ago.
I cannot do what I used to be able to do, and I never will be.
I am not going to get well, only worse.
And it is time that I and everyone around me accept that!Linda and I have had some very good, very frank, very forward looking, conversations on this topic over the last few days and we have come to one conclusion, we are going to do for us.
We are going to spend time together, doing what we have always wanted to do and did not do because of some responsibility to our career, our son, our church, and organization, a meeting, or anything outside of she and I.
That does not mean I am shutting any of you out.
As a matter of fact, you may see us more often.
The real issue is that WE are going to run our schedule, not someone or something else.I remember, a long time ago, when I had first made Chief.
I was on the USS Stein in San Diego.
My Dad had flown out for a visit and we were having a dependents cruise the day my Dad was scheduled to fly home.
I dearly wanted him to stay and get underway with us for that day.
I could have shown him things he never would have an opportunity to see.
I was proud of my Navy and what I did for it.
But, he had a bowling banquet he wanted to attend, so he declined.
Until the day he died, he told me how much he regretted that decision!I do not want to regret not doing something, seeing something or someone important to me, and especially, I do not want to waste a minute of time that I could spend with my wife.
Yes, today's meeting was very good for us.

Have you ever looked in the mirror and not recognized the person looking back?
I have, and it is not fun at all.
I don't recognize myself and I know that I am not who I once was.
But what is more frightening is that I do not know who I am.
Yes, I know my name.
But what makes me; my memories, my past, my profession, my dreams, are all fading.
I live for the moment that I am in.
I cannot remember, easily, what happened through the day, when I lay down to go to sleep.
I have to concentrate to remember people's names that I should know.
The names of people I have know for decades are just not there anymore.
What is even more bothersome and frightening, is that I cannot plan for the future.
I no longer see a future.
I only see today, and I see that in a fog.I remember 1991, a year of extreme sorrow and anguish for me.
My Dad, whom I was very close to and loved dearly, passed away, my Father -in-law passed away, and my birth Mother passed away.
All of these people meant a lot to me and I still miss them.
Their memories are more dim to me now, but the pain is not.
But I was able to survive that time, because I knew there was more to come.
More life to experience, more challenges, more victories.
This anguish and pain is deeper, because I know that I am fading into darkness.
I am slowly disappearing from my own memory.
I know there is nothing else after this.
The person who looks back is a stranger to me know.
And I don not want to get to know him.

I have just figured out something in my life, that many of you who are also dealing with a dementia issue may have already known.
That is, the stress of dealing with the reaction of others, to my disease, is causing me great difficulties.
I honestly just figured this out in the last few moments.
And, honestly, I don't know what to do with it or about it.
I see a number of reactions to my condition, especially since it is becoming more apparent to everyone, that I am progressing more and more.
I see anger, disbelief, disapproval, sympathy, sadness, horror, and even shock.
One day, not to very long ago, we were in a restaurant, and as is now the process, Linda was ordering for me.
The waitress was very disapproving of this arrangement.
I guess she did not know what was going on, but she was really shocked.
Some people talk louder to me.
I guess they think I can't hear them or maybe I forgot HOW to hear!
Trust me, I can't remember but I hear fairly well in my left ear.
My right ear is of little use because of the MK 42 5"/54 Naval Gun.However, I am writing this to ask for some input from those of you who read this Blog and are dealing with the same issues.
Am I being over sensitive?
Or do you see the same things also.
I will also ask the EASE support group people also.
Thanks for your help.

I have changed the title of my BLOG to "Sharing my life with Lewy Body Dementia" because that seems to be the correct diagnosis, at least for the present.
Since diagnosing any memory effecting neurological disease seems to be like shooting fish in a barrel in the dark, I will go with this diagnosis for the present.
I LIKE to be accurate.
I guess it's the "Monk" in me.
So, I hope it does not cause any of you too much trouble.Linda and I have enrolled in an American Alzheimer's Association study.
We are now part of the EASE program, "Early Alzheimer's Support and Education" program.
It is exactly what I need and wanted, contact with others that are dealing with the same issues that I am.
It is a group of patients and care givers.
Now, I know what you are thinking; He does not have Alzheimer's.
True, almost.
It seems that the medical field and the Alzheimer's Association are grouping all "Dementia's" under the Alzheimer's banner.
I guess this makes sense since the symptoms are similar and the medications are all the same.
And, remember what my GP said; "The only way we will know for sure, what you have is to wait until you die, and cut the top of your head open."
Sounds drastic, but it is true.
I really appreciate his honesty and candor.
I have never wanted to be molly coddled.
The truth always works for me, even if it is uncomfortable.In any case, this group is very good for me and I enjoyed our first meeting.
There is a safe feeling with the group and an openness that I appreciate.
Unlike work groups, there is none of the "territory marking" that goes on in the corporate world.
Just honesty, openness, and an honest desire to help each other while asking for help.I will keep you informed, while keeping the group's privacy in mind, as the program develops.
I remember when Linda's Dad had Alzheimer's.
There was no Alzheimer's Association, no drugs to extend the quality of life, and no professionals with an advanced degree in Gerontology to help us.
Now, Linda and I have a support group made up of family, church, friends, medical professionals, and other with the disease.
This is the best way to handle a difficult situation.Another issue has arisen, I participate in a wonderful international Bible study called "Bible Study Fellowship" (BSF) I am a Group Leader in the program, and as such, I lead 15 men through a specific Bible study each week.
Last week, during the "Leaders Meeting", I was leading the leaders through the study questions and I lost my place.
I did not know what question was next.
I was completely lost and I told them so and asked them which question we were on.
They graciously directed me back on track and we picked up where we left off.
After that exercise, I told my fellow leaders about my condition.
It surprised some of them, our Teaching Leader already knew since I told him before he asked me to be part of the leadership.
Their caring attitude, acceptance, and love, was overwhelming.
I was concerned, no, afraid is a better description, that my condition would show up and cause me issues.
Now I know that, even if it does, it's not a show stopper.
That is important to me.
I need acceptance, not denial, from those around me.
I learned that last Monday night, from the men of my BSF group.More later.

I have been very open in describing how I am doing and what I am going through in my postings on this blog.
I find it therapeutic for me, and I hope informative for the readers to be honest and open.
There is also the issue of my fading memory.
If I don't tell the truth, I will not know what I told to whom!!
Remember when you were young and you might have told a "little" lie to one person, and another "stretched" story to another, and they got together and compared stories?
Bad scene, right?
So, the truth is the only way to go.
In any case, if I tell you what is wrong, I should also tell you what is going well.
So, there has been some positive development in the area of my sleep at night.
I have posted in the past that nights were difficult for me,and that was and is still true, but, recently nights have been a little easier to manage.
Linda and I have discovered that we stay up until very late, say 1 AM or later, I can sleep until 5:30 or so.
What we are doing is staying up until I am dead tired and then going to bed instead of going to bed when I am merely sleepy and waking up with a dream.
I am still dreaming, and some are violent, but I seem to be able to manage them better, or at least I am so tired that I can and do go back to sleep.
Another issue is, we have all but stopped taking afternoon naps.
I miss my nap, but I will give it up for a quiet night's sleep for both of us.
I also seem to be more rested in the morning.
So, this is a good development and a welcomed one.On a negative note, I am finding that I am more uncomfortable in familiar settings than before.
Today in church, I became uncomfortable and disoriented in the opening moments of the service.
I grabbed my wife's hand and the feelings subsided after a few moments.
That goes along with how I felt when we were out  to lunch last week with Linda's co-workers.
But that was an unknown location and we have been going to this church and I have been an active member for 7 years.
So, I just chalk this up to what's happening with me.
As long as Linda is with me, I am fine.
That's reassuring to me.
This week we will celebrate our 38 th wedding anniversary!
She has been a real help to me for a long time.
She is my partner and co-laborer in good times and difficult times.
We have found a way to enjoy life through all circumstances.
I thank GOD everyday for Linda's love and caring.So, all in all, I am doing as good as I can.
I do appreciate all of you who help me and pray for me.
Thanks for being there.

Tonight, on NCIS, Bob Newhart was the guest star.
So, naturally, I watched.
I like Bob Newhart.
I liked his television shows, I like his comedy, and I liked him in "The Librarian" series made for TV movies.
He is a good actor, funny, and believable.
Tonight, he portrayed a retired medical examiner from NCIS' past.
The present ME, known as "Duckie" was his friend.
What no one knew, including the viewers was that the retired ME, Bob Newhart, had Alzheimer's Disease.
Mr. Newhart's character was portrayed as a mid-stage AD patient.
He portrayed the part of an AD patient exceptionally well.
Appearing normal, rational, and in touch one minute, and spaced out, unable to function, and in a fantasy world the next.
I am very happy that this sub-plot was woven into this series at this time.
My wife saw things that I do, and she misses, in Mr. Newhart's character.
I hope all of you watch this episode.
It will give you insight into my life, and the life of others in my shoes.
Mr. Newhart said, in character, that he was loosing what he was, and sometimes could not remember what he did.
He returned to NCIS headquarters to try to regain who he was and his self-worth.
I too, am afraid that I am loosing my identity.
Much of my past memories are fading.
I can't remember the old standard jokes I used to tell, my sea stories are fading, and when I try to remember, my mind is a blank.
Mr. Newhart's character said he used to be able to replay all the cases he worked on in his mind, and NOW he can't remember any of them.
I used to remember ALL of the electrical, electronic, and hydraulic circuits of the MK 42 Mod 9 & 10 gun mount and could quote you valve designation, circuit symbols, and how they interfaced for the entire gun loading and power drive system.
Now, I just don't remember.
Part of me is fading away.
I really don't like that and there is no way to restore what is lost.
People who judge me, doubt me, question my honesty need to watch this episode.
I wrote today on the Alzheimer's Association Chat room; "People don't think someone had dementia or AD unless they are peeing in their pants and drooling on their shirt."
Much like cancer, AD and Dementia have a start and a finish.
But unlike cancer, there is no way to treat what I have and no hope of recovery.
Please watch this episode.

The title is not overstated.
I find nights terrifying.
I seem to feel pretty good during the day.
I am on an even keel, emotionally.
And, even when I have memory issues, which is more often than not, I can laugh at them and not be too bothered.
When I loose my balance , for no reason, I can laugh and say; "The room moved" as if I was still on a ship and we were at sea.
But, when the sun goes down, my mood turns very dark.
I am frustrated and angry at everything.
Noise sends me into a rage that I can presently keep internal most of the time.
Little things become insurmountable.
I have difficulty concentrating on anything for any period of time.
That does fit with today's television shows; i.e.
5 minutes of content followed by 4 minutes of inane commercials.
(Sorry for the editorial comment.)
Relationships are difficult and I am convinced that most people are out to get me.
No, I am not overstating the facts.
As a matter of fact, I may be understating them.
And to top it off, if I do go to bed, I know if I sleep, I will dream and that most of my dreams are violent and frightening.
Last night, I went to bed, angry and I worked myself into a fit of rage that I knew would lead to horrific dreams.
So, I got up and occupied myself with the computer playing Free Cell and Solitaire and reading and rereading the sites I look at.
I even got on the Alzheimer's Association web site and entered their area to post things, looking for help.
That did not work either.
So, as usual, I stayed up until I was dead tired.
Then I went to bed and passed out.
Last night, my faithful miniature poodle, Marcel, would not even stay up with me.
So, I was all alone, in my rage.
What was I angry at?
It does not matter.
Will it happen again?
Yes, I am certain.
And before you ask, Yes, my neurologist and GP know of this problem and the neurologist has prescribed some drugs.
Actually we are on the second attempt at solving this problem with pharmaceuticals, with little or no help.
I have even thought about drinking myself into a stupor every night.
But then, I will feel bad in the morning too!
So that's not a viable option.
What to do?
I am at a loss.
I have an upcoming neurologist appointment and we will discuss this then.
Until then, I will be up, and angry or sad, or some other negative emotion, until all hours of the night.
P.S.
I made a spelling error that I noticed after I posted this.
That little mistake sent me into a rage of self hatred.
I need to find a way to deal with this.

I am sorry that I have not posted on this blog in a while.
While I could offer many excuses, the fact is, I have found it difficult to put my feelings into words.
As many of you know, I have been writing on my other blog, "The Master Chief's Lair" and I find that forum an escape from the progression of my condition.
Additionally, when I write in "The Master Chief's Lair" I feel like I am still on active duty, still the Master Chief, and still pertinent to the Navy.
Yes, I have wanted to escape from thinking about how things are progressing.
Also, I find myself confused about what I have, how it came to be, and what the future holds.
Let me explain some of that.
Recently, an acquaintance of my wife and mine has put us in contact with the Alzheimer's Association.
They were looking for some volunteers with dementia or related issues to participate in a study.
Linda and I are both open to being participants in studies in the hope that we may help someone else.
The Alzheimer's Association believes, and their research backs this up, that dementia is the symptom of Alzheimer's.
So, my question is, do I have Lewy Body Dementia or Alzheimer's?
That may be a fine line to you, but it is something I want to know.
The old Gunner's Mate in me always wanted to know what was the root cause of the failure of the gun system.
Why, so I could prevent it from happening again, or at least, so I could fix it when it did happen again.
It seems medicine is not like that.
So, that is a frustration, and ALL frustrations are magnified for me because of my disease.That brings me to another issue.
I am becoming more and more paranoid.
I feel that people are following me or spying on me.
I have extreme difficulty trusting anyone except my wife and my closest friend.
My sleep patterns are terrible even though we have doubled up on the "Don't Beat Linda Up" medicine at night.
Yes, that was done with my neurologists direction.
My dreams remain about my days in the Navy.
While they are a comfort to me sometimes, they mostly are situations that cause me anguish and confusion.
My attention span has decreased, my short term memory is limited to hours.
Today in Church, a friend asked me how my week was, and I replied;  OK, as much as I remember, and I was not fooling.
He apologized for not coming over to help us with exercises last week, and I really did not remember that he had planned to.
The bottom line is, whatever I have is getting worse, and my isolation within myself, is increasing.
I have little interest in being with people, or doing anything.
Conversations are limited, because I just don't have anything to say.
I live, in my mind, in memories and stories about the past.
Right now, I can see myself doing this, I am afraid that soon, I will not realize this fact and I will slip away into the past as I saw Linda's Dad do so may years ago.
While it does me good to write about this, it also brings it to the forefront and upsets me.
But, never fear I will continue to write, until I can't.

I have dedicated both of my Blogs to expressing what is in my heart, what has happened in my life that was important to me, and my expressions of the people in my life that really matter to me.
When I was 15, I never thought I would live to be 21.
I was wild and  crazy, out of control.
I have written about the trouble I got myself in in my Navy Blog.
That trouble lead to a wonderful Navy career of 40 years.
When I was 30, I never thought I would see 40.
I did,.
After 40, I thought I would live forever, I will not.
That's not a news flash to me, I always knew there would be an end.
And, for a long time, I have not feared death.
Working in gun mounts and with explosives in the Navy, I was always a half step away from death's door.
My combat missions always put me on the knife edge of life and death.
I was OK with that, I actually embraced it.
That emotional high made me feel "Alive" and I liked it!Now, at 59, almost 60, I am facing my own demise from an enemy that I cannot combat.
I have no defense, not pistol to return fire, no maneuver that will enable me to safely run away to fight another day.
This is "IT".
I have written before that I consider this disease a "blessing" because I can concentrate on life, my relationships, and enjoying my final days.
I still feel that way, but, as things progress, I feel increasingly helpless in dealing with my disease.
I cannot even effectively manage my own medications anymore.
My memory skills just cannot handle that simple task.
Thank goodness the Pharmacist that helps me knows what I am going through.
Otherwise, he would probably turn me in for selling prescription drugs on the market!
Again today, I walked up to the Farm Fresh Pharmacy counter and asked for my refills.
He gently told me that he filled them last week.
I left perplexed and went home to discover what I did with those pill bottles this time!
I found them and in doing so, came to the realization that I cannot take care of myself anymore.
That realization hurts more than anything else.
I am now dependent on someone else for my second most basic needs.
Yes, I can still go to the bathroom on my own, but that will change too.
Oh I hope that takes a long time!
Maybe my memory will fail totally before I need that help.I am increasingly despondent and depressed,  unable to sleep through the night, disoriented in my own home, and angry at the entire situation.
Rationally, I know this is a normal phase of my malaise.
Emotionally, I am a wreck.
And this is still the first half!
Much like a Redskin's game, I am NOT looking forward to the second half!Again, I am not looking for sympathy, I am reporting, for any one's benefit who is interested, what I am going through and what I am feeling.
Jerry and I are still going out and doing fun things.
we went bowling this week and I had a great time.
Of course, I had to use a 13 pound ball instead of a 16 pounder, and I could not do a three step approach for fear that I would fall, but I still broke 100 each game!
Not Dick Weber or Earl Anthony level, but not bad for not bowling for a few years.
One of these days, I am going roller skating again!
My neurologist says that is a core memory for me since I started skating at 3 and skated competitively until I joined the navy.
We will see if she is right!
I will keep you posted.

If you read my last post, you now know that the doctors at UVA have confirmed what my neurologist and I thought, but would not say, I have Lewy Body Dementia.
I added an explanation from WEBMD as a Link on this Blog.
If you are interested, I suggest you read it.
The information from WEBMD is sobering, to say the least.Lewy Body Dementia starts out as a memory issue.
That makes sense since the first problems I documented were my problems driving on Interstate 64 and not knowing where I was where I was going, or where I was coming from.
The first neurologist I saw after a few of those events, gave me the "remember these three things" test, and told me I was fine.
Two or three years later, when I started to develop muscle rigidity on the entire left side of my body and I was forgetting more and more, my family doctor, who is an exceptional professional, sent me to another neurologist, Dr. Bowles, who did not discount my symptoms as a fraud and did 9 months of testing.
She tested me for everything under the sun and at first came up with Parkinson's with Dementia.
But she was not satisfied with that general diagnosis and kept trying to find the real issue.
She sent me to UVA for a second opinion, and after their testing and evaluations, Lewy Body Dementia is the call.
The first neurologist I saw is the norm!
I have read on the Lewy Body Dementia web sight a number of family stories about parents that faded away as their doctors told them they were fine.
I was blessed in that I only had to go to two neurologists to find one that believed me.All dementia's have Lewy Body connections.
Lewy Bodies are a protein jumble that disrupts brain function.
They grow at an increasing speed as the disease progresses and result in loss of memory, Parkinson's symptoms, loss of bodily functions, and eventually, death.
That is, unless you die from a complication like aspirating food and either choking to death of developing pneumonia and dieing from that.
No big deal you have to die from something!How long do I have?
That is the million dollar question.
The WEBMD article says that the normal run of LBD is 5-7 years from diagnosis.
That seems short to may of you.
But the same article states that there are documented cases in the study that had patients live as little as 2 years and as long as 20!
Evidently GOD gave me a very good memory.
You will remember that I told you all before that I had near total recall.
In the Navy, I could easily memorize complicated electronic and hydraulic schematics, integrate them for the operational sequence of a very complicated gun mount, and have them in my memory indefinitely.
After I retired, I went to work, briefly, for GEICO insurance.
They sent me to their Material Damage Adjuster's course.
I remember the president of GEICO, Mr. Tony Nicely, telling me; " Don, we won't hold it against you if you fail this course since we only send college graduates to this course."
Well, let me tell you, those college grads were dropping like flies, because they could not hack 10 hours of school and 4 hours of homework a day!
For me, it was gravy!
Just like going to Mk 42 Mod 9&10 "C" School.
I remember one night we had to memorize about 200 parts of the GM Hydromatic transmission for a test the next morning.
Those college kids were cutting their wrists!
So, I sat them down in my hotel room and taught them how to study and memorize.
Some of them did OK, most did not.
I aced the test, as I did most everything they through at me.
AT graduation, Mr. Nicely asked me; "Don, how did you do so well?"
I told Tony, they need to hire military retirees not college kids if they want people who will buckle down and learn.
He did not take my advice.
By the way, I wrote the highest score for the entire 6 week course ever written.
And I will bet that score still stands today.So, anyway, I started with a remarkable memory, so I have a long way to fall.
That coupled with my belief in GOD'S will and my positive attitude may put me on the long side of the averages.
But, it may not.
Only time will tell.
But I have not given up, slowed down, or even considered either path.
I will charge on, and do the best that I can as long as GOD lets me live.
That is the best I can be and what GOD and all of you expect from me.
So, to answer the question, how long do I have?
As long as GOD gives me.
Not a day less or more.
Just keep that in mind when you want to feel sorry for me.
And for those of you who do not have LBD or any other terminal disease, you have the same limitation that I have.
You only have as long as GOD gives you.
Think about that when lay down to go to sleep tonight.
It is truly a sobering thought.
One that I have already dealt with, have you?

My medical situation over the past three years or so has reminded me of an old joke;  It seemed, two friends were hiking in the Arizona desert.
After a while had passed, one of the guys needed to relieve himself, and found a private patch of cactus to accomplish the task.
As he was doing so, an unseen rattlesnake bit him in the place, any man would not want to be bitten by a poisonous snake.
He ran to his friend in horror, screaming, "I'm going to die!!!"
His friend, knowing a little about first aid, calmed his friend, got him to lay down, covered him from the onslaught of the sun, gave him some water and ran into the nearest town to get some medical help.
Try as he might, there was no doctor, only an old timer who told him; "when someone gets a rattlesnake bite, the treatment is to use a a sharp knife, cut an "X" on each fang puncture until you draw blood, then suck the venom out."
The un-bitten friend was horrified, but he ran back to his friend.
When he got to him, the stricken friend said; "What did you find out?".
The other fellow said; "You're going to die!!!
"As you know, today Linda and I went to UVA to finally get our "Second Opinion".
I must say, both doctors were very professional, caring, and attentive today.
Their demeanor and my treatment was exactly at the professional level that my wife and I are used to from Dr. Bowles and other fine physicians.
The Clinical Neuropsychologist explained the cognitive test results,  explaining that while I was still functioning at a high level of memory and function, it was apparent that I was not functioning at the level that I was used too.
He also commented that during the tests he noticed periods of slowdown and confusion, that I did recover from as the tests proceeded.
The the 14 year old, Neurologist, explained how all of the findings from all of the testing that was done before by Dr. Bowles' team and this new testing, coupled with the memory and behavior changes reported by my wife and myself  fit together to paint a picture.
That picture is not what we had hoped for, but, we now have a clear cut diagnosis of what I am facing.The 14 year old, who's real name is Dr. Voss, explained that key points like my REM Sleep Disorder, (that's when I punch Linda in my sleep acting out my dreams) and my violent reaction to one type of drug that Dr. Bowles prescribed a while back, coupled with my issues of loosing track of time, where I am at, and my surroundings, and my hallucinations, tracks clearly towards the diagnosis of "Lewy Body Dementia".
Lewy Body Dementia (LBD) brings with hit many of the Parkinson's issues, like the stiffness, loss of balance, some shaking, and night shaking, all of which I already have.
Where LBD differs is the length of time that it takes for the disease to progress.
LBD is much faster, start to finish, than Parkinson's with Dementia.
Dr, Voss noted that Dr, Bowles did exactly the correct thing by getting me started on Razadyne and Namenda, early.
This aggressive drug treatment will slow down the progression of the disease, as much as is possible, today.
My research on line, using WEBMD and the Lewy Body Dementia Society web site has revealed that LBD takes between 2 and 20 years to run it's course.
Good news, since this probably started about 3 years ago.
I already have the low number beat!!
And that is how I will continue to approach this.
I am not going to give up, quit trying, or be defeated without a fight.
I have a wonderful medical team, the best wife in the world, a great, supportive family, a supportive church family and many friends to depend on, and I will.So, while the news is not as positive as some may have hoped, it is good to finally know the exact cause of my problems.
For this I am grateful.
I will keep you all informed through this blog and other means of communications.
But don't call this Thursday morning, Jerry and I are going golfing!

As I wrote recently, it has been a BUSY summer.
Busier than I can ever remember.
Well, busier than I can remember now!
I just completed our church's first Senior's Health and Safety day.
We brought in a number of senior health and welfare specialists to inform the community of the many services, many of them free or at a very reasonable cost, that are available in the Virginia Beach area.
This city is full of honest good deals for seniors!
I had plenty of help pulling this event together from many quarters.
Early in the planning, our long time, very close friend, Marcia Hart, told us about the City of Virginia Beach Senior Services Coordinator, a wonderful lady named Nancy Allen.
She is a treasure trove of information about senior services.
Not only that, but she is the administrator of a great Senior's Respite Care Program.
This can be a life saver to a care taker.
Imaging, being able to leave your husband or wife, in loving caring hands, to go out and have a social outing, go to the doctor, or shop, in peace.
How much does this cost, depending on what the family income is, as little as $3/ hour and at the most, $8/hour.
Now that is reasonable.In any case, I was busy, maybe even overwhelmed.
At about 10 Am, I was having real problems forming sentences and I really wanted to just leave, go home, and hide!
But, "Spot Light" syndrome kept me functioning, to a point.
However, after the event, was a different issue.
We returned home at about 2 PM.
We immediately went to bed and slept, rested, tossed and turned, until about 4:30 PM.
We both got up, at a small dinner, and went back to bed until 8:30 PM.
We then got up and tried to reconstruct the day, going back to bed at 11:30PM and sleeping until this morning.Today, I had great difficulty with my situational awareness.
I just could not keep track of what time it was or what I was doing.
I tried to accomplish some chores around the apartment while my wife went to her Bible study, but I was truly startled and shocked when she walked into the apartment at 11:30AM.
I was sure it was earlier than 10 AM!
I was truly lost in time.
This is not a totally new issue, but today it seemed more deep, more disturbing.
It actually consumed me for a while.
We went out this afternoon to run some errands, and I even gave up the driving duties to my wife, because I did not feel "Safe" driving the car.
Now that is a first for me.
I am always the driver and only give up the wheel after a great amount of prodding from my wife.
Oh well, better safe than sorry.Next Monday, we go to see the 14 year old at UVA.
This should be our last visit to UVA.
I am done with their uncaring attitude and "Text Book" medicine.I will keep you all informed.
Thanks for every one's help with the Senior's Day!

We have really been on the go this month.
First, the grand children were in town for Surf Camp and their annual trip to Triple "R" Camp.
This is a great Christian camp, 6 days and nights of fun activities and spiritual enrichment.
Both boys love Triple "R" and always ask to go back!
After that three weeks, we headed up to Canandaigua, for our traditional week of camping on the lake.
We rent a cabin and spend the week enjoying the peaceful surrounding.
This year, we did something different.
Linda decided it would be better for me to stay at our kid's house at night.
It would be more familiar surroundings, and I could have my trust dog, Marcel, with me.
So, the first night, as it began to get dark, I went back to the house, alone!
I quickly found out that was not going to work.
I was completely disoriented in the house and when I turned the lights out, to go to sleep, I was terrified.
So, the first night, I spent up, watching TV, with Marcel.
I finally went to bed at 5AM, with the lights on.
The other nights, Linda went back to the house with me.
That worked much better.After, 6 days at Canandaigua, we headed to Cleveland Ohio, to see my family.
It was a wonderful reunion and we truly enjoyed seeing everyone.
My sister and Brother are both getting on in years but they still are doing very well.
I got to see my Brother's, Son's, new twins!
They are 15 months old and precious.
After 3 days in Cleveland, we headed home, through some of the worst traffic I have seen.
We arrived home late Monday night, exhausted.
Tuesday was a blur and we are just now beginning to unpack.The things we learned from this trip are;  I do not do well, being away from home and my routine for a long period of time.
Ten days is too ling for me to be away from home.
This will direct our future travel plans.
I spent a good portion of last night awake, because of dreams.
That was a problem that had began to dissipate somewhat, but it seems to be back in full force now.
Another thing I learned, or at least was reinforced, was while I have little or no desire to do much of anything, I will go along with the group, and enjoy myself.
When we went out to eat, Linda did my ordering.
I just could not settle on what I wanted.
But then, decision making has been a problem for a while, and it seems to be getting worse.
I also discovered that crowds make it difficult for me to participate in the conversation.
One on One, I do fine, add the background noise and I get confused and shutdown.Again, it was a great trip, and we learned a lot about where I am.
Next year's trip will have to be shorter, and less busy.
But that is normal for the progression of dementia.
Just the same, I am glad to be home.

There is a nurse, from my insurance company, that calls me every month to see how I am doing.
I believe I have discussed her and the Assurance Program of Blue Cross before.
She is very caring and offers good advice and a caring ear to complain to.
She always asks me if I have been injured or have been hospitalized due to my Parkinson's or Dementia.
Up to now, I have always had to say no, thankfully.
Well, last Monday, that all changed.
The grandsons are visiting us for a couple of weeks and Grandma has all sorts of activities planned for them.
This week was surf camp, and Monday was cool and wet.
As the boys were surfing, Linda and I decided to go back to the car and get warm.
We put some things in the back of our Forrester, and I remembered that she had a rain jacket in the box I keep in the back.
So I rushed to the back of the car, complete oblivious to the fact that she was forcefully shutting the tail gate.
You guessed it, lots of blood, a ride to the Hospital in an ambulance, and 6 staples in my forehead.
Not to mention a pretty good headache.
I am OK, and the staples look like a new fashion statement, but the next time I get that call, I can say, Yes, because I was not aware of my circumstances.

I guess I have been writing a lot lately, but that is because, there seems to be plenty happening.
As I have said in my Navy Blog, I have a friend staying with us this weekend.
We have had some good time together, but he is really here for a friend of his wedding.
He and I stayed up a little late last night, talking Navy, about 11:30PM I went to bed and right to sleep.
I woke at 5:00AM and I thought wow, I slept all night.
I went to the bathroom, went back to bed until 7:00AM and then got up and made coffee.
I woke my wife at 8:00 AM and told her how good I felt sleeping all night.
She told me; "No you didn't!"
I know I was dreaming, I always do, but the content of those dreams is lost to me most of the time and certainly last night.
But, according to my wife, I was laying on my back, moving my hands and arms, like I was trying to repair something or put something together.
She said she held my hands down a couple of times, trying to calm me, and as soon as she let go, I went back to "Work".
I have no idea what I was doing, there was no finished product when I got up, but I did feel rested and good!
I sure hope I work tonight too!

I was reading over some of my first writings on this blog, and I discovered that I have never written about the first Dementia symptoms.
That surprises me, but maybe not.
I DO forget things.
While my wife has some recollections of memory issues after a severe car wreck, not my fault, I was rear ended at a stop light.
Those memories are not in my memory bank.
The first real issues I remember is driving down Interstate 64, in Norfolk, a route I have taken almost every day since 1983.
I was driving, and all at once, I  did not know where I was going, where I was, and where I had come from!
It was very frightening!
I remember thinking, just keep going and this will make sense, and, about 5 minutes or so later, it all came back to me.
I pretty much "Blew it off" and credited it to stress, working too hard, or need of rest.
Over the next few weeks, the same thing happened a couple of more times, so I told my wife about it.
Naturally, she was concerned and made me promise to see my doctor.
Then on a Saturday, my son and I were coming back from a hardware store, and as I pulled up on the freeway, I told my son; "I don't want to alarm you, but I don't know where we are or where we are going."
He said; "  We are going home Dad."
My reply was; "Fine, where is that."
It is true, I did not know where I lived.
In any case, I saw my GP, a wonderful, doctor who I trust completely.
He sent me to a neurologist, who after two appointments of 15 minutes each, dismissed me and said there was nothing wrong with me.So, I continued on, having memory issues, getting lost, having periods of freight and confusion, and having this "Numb" feeling in the front of my head.
After a year or so, I began to experience stiffness throughout the left side of my body.
Arm, leg, shoulder, even my foot.
I went to see my GP again, and he said, I think something is going on here and sent me to Dr. Mary Bowles, a neurologist who actually does tests!
I answered more questions, questionnaires, and had more tests, CT scans, MRI's, X-rays, blood tests, cognitive skills tests, computer based tests, WOW!
She and her staff ran be through the ringer for about 9 months.
That lead to me trying Sinemet, and gradually, the stillness went away.
She then went to work on my memory, and started me on Arecept.
I must say, I don't think Arecept helped all that much.
Later she shifted me to Razadyne and added Namenda.
That made a marked difference in my memory function and made me capable of working and functioning more normally.
But, not even those medications are beginning to loose their effectiveness as, I was told they would.
I guess I have been on the combination for about two years.
Now, I have more problems finding words, staying on task, remembering what day it is, or where I am.
I can't remember passwords or learn new skills.
I have REM sleep disorder and my wife has the bruises to prove it.
My fine motor skills are getting worse, as a Gunner's Mate, I tell folks; "My fine synchro is out of adjustment."
But that is just the progression of the Dementia, Lewy Body Dementia, Alzheimer's, or what ever they want to call it.The thing I like the most about Dr. Bowles is that she is aggressive and she believes what I say.
Of course, my wife is in every appointment and Dr. Bowles questions Linda also on my progress.
I have been examined by neurologists from the Veteran's Administration and from UVA, (see other posts) and they all have about the same diagnosis.
The neurologist the VA sent me to told me to retire, and enjoy the few good days I had left!
A pretty strong and truthful recommendation, that I took.This has been a long journey, and I really can't tell you when I actually started.
All I can do is tell you where I think I am now.
In the Navy there was a saying; " The only constant is change, and it is variable."
That about sums up the rest of my life, and I am OK with that.
At least I am not bored.

My Mom, died from complications from the treatment of uterine cancer in 1976.
The radiation treatment that was used in those days was very unfocused and wide spectrum.
The radiation from the cancer treatment damaged every organ in her abdomen and she died of uremia because her bladder was gone from the radiation.
I paint this painful picture, because I can still see and hear my Dad standing over my Mom, His wife of 48 years, as he pinched her big toe and said; "you'll be OK Evelyn, all you have to do is get up and walk around the block!"
He did not understand what was happening to her.
Heck, none of us did.
We all wanted her to be better, but that was not to be.
Friends and family say the same sort of thing to me, on a regular basis.
"Don, all you need is a computer calender and your memory will get better."
or;  "You need more discipline in your life!"
First of all, those of you who have known me for more that a few years know I was one of the most disciplined, principled, people you will ever know.
You can't make Master Chief in the United States Navy, in 14 years 6 months, and not be disciplined.
If you don't understand the military, you will not understand my level of personal discipline.
Navy Regulations, rules, tradition, responsibility, uniform regulations, physical requirements, ruled my life.
I would not even hold my own child when in uniform because it would hinder me from saluting!
I am the picture of discipline.
But, parts of our bodies fail.
Why?
Ask GOD, it's his plan.
There is a verse in the Bible that tells us that all the days of our lives are written in GOD's book BEFORE we are even conceived!
GOD knew, before I was born that I was going to be a Navy Master Chief and He knew I was going to have to deal with Parkinson's and Dementia.
Nothing I have done, or can do will change that.
Furthermore, it is getting worse!I realize I have written about this before, but people close to me, just don't understand what I am going through.
So some of my friends,  just like my Dad, who believed that a good, fast walk around the block would cure what "ails" you, believe if I kept a calender, a list of things to do, or if I was just more disciplined in how I conducted my life, I would get better.
Well, my friends, just like Mom, I am not going to get better and the end product of this is that I am going end up drooling on my shirt and peeing in my pants!
As my Dentist, who is also a friend said; "If you drool enough, no one will notice the pee!"
That's my goal!
But I probably won't know anyway.So, while I know your recommendations are offered with an honest desire to help me get better, all they do is make me feel like you think I am a liar, or a malingerer, or a gold brick.
It is like you feel that if you just slapped me, like General Patton did to that fellow for having battle fatigue, that I would snap out of it and get back to normal.
This is normal, and it's on a sliding scale!
and the slide is down!
And frankly, I am getting tired of being called a liar!
I have had more medical tests, cognitive skills tests, and seen more Neurologists and Neuropsychologists than I ever knew existed.
It took my Neurologist and her team 9 months to diagnose this.
The Federal Retirement System, under the control of the Office of Personal Management granted me a disability retirement on the first request.
That never happens, so did Social Security.
You know they never go easy.
So why do you continue to question my illness?
Please, accept this, so we can move on to living with my condition instead of trying to cure it.
There is no cure!
I have accepted that, and so should everyone else.

This has been an interesting week to observe.
I say that because sometimes, I actually feel like I am watching myself progress through this portion of my life from a distance.
No, I don't think I am crazy, I just think it is a perspective I have developed.
As I wrote last, we had a wonderful time with family and all the "Tourist" activities that a person who lives in a resort city never enjoys.
That is strange in itself.
We live here, yet we never went para sailing.
I have never rode a jet ski either, I would like too, but I have never done it.
In any case, I have been "recovering" from all the activities, while planning two big church events, and getting ready for our grandsons to arrive next week.
So, to say the least, I am not sitting idle, but I am making sure I get my afternoon nap.Back to the observation issue.
My dreams have become more disturbing and more frequent, and even with the increase in the "Don't beat Linda Up" drug, I am constantly being woke up because of these dreams.
Normally, I wake up three of four times a night.
Linda says I twitch and move around, but she has not put her catcher's mask back on, yet.
I have commented before on the fact that I have lost the motivation to do much of anything.
If Linda does not plan it, I don't do it.
I would be perfectly happy to sleep, sit around, and do nothing.
But she has a way of keeping me busy with daily lists of "Chores" that have to be done.
I don't actually know why, but she says they do.
For instance, She decided I need a Passport.
WHY, I am never leaving the continental United States again.
Just the same, we applied to renew my Passport.
Church projects keep us busy and that is good.
I feel more engaged when I am doing something for the Lord.
My best friend, Jerry, who is fighting his own medical challenges is setting up a scheduled "Shooting" time for him and I.
So many of the times that I go shooting now, I am teaching someone.
And I get little trigger time.
But I still really enjoy shooting.
And yes, I am still deadly accurate.So, as I see all these things unfolding, and me being active within these little structures, I still feel like it is not ME doing the activities, but someone else.
I still get tired from them, but if you asked me if I did this, or enjoyed that, for a moment, I have to stop and think; "Did I do that?".
Again, since I have few points of reference, I wonder if other Dementia patients have this sensation.
If you know someone who experiences this, let me know.As a post note to some earlier ramblings about my bad experiences with UVA Medical, they have struck again.
The man-child with the PHD in Neuro-Psychology assured me that he, the 14 year old Neurologist, and Linda and I , would have an appointment to discuss the cognitive scores test and their diagnosis the second half of July.
We explained that we had company the July 4th week and than the Grandsons all of August.
So, yesterday, I received my letter from UVA with the appointment information.
You guessed it, 2 August.
So, I called the number in the letter to change the appointment, played phone tag through a number of departments and finally got hung up on!
I called the semi-literate woman who is the live voice and she finally got me to the Neurology clinic, where the receptionist had a good laugh at my telephone issues and the scheduling problems.
Is anyone at UVA concerned with the well being of the patient.
I called a patient onmbusman, who assured me she would get to the bottom of it and call me back yesterday.
Just like the little boy who swallowed the quarter, no change yet!Yet, as much as UVA frustrates me, I still have a surreal feeling about the contact with them, and my visits there.
Yes, I know I went there, but it seems almost like a dream.
So, is this progress or progression.
We will see.

We just had the apartment full of family, for the Fourth of July holiday and it was great!
I have to tell you that I had more fun, did more things, and enjoyed myself more that I have since last summer.
We went Para sailing for the first time!!
My wife and I had thought about it once or twice, but we did it.
We went up 1000 feet!
OK, they let out 1000' of line and the boat was going forward, but we were up there.
I asked the crew to really dunk us in the ocean, they did!
It was great!
Now, we probably would not have done that if we did not have all the company, but they were interested and it all fit together.
I also got the opportunity to take my Nephew's 10 year old son shooting for the first time.
I also took my other Nephew and his wife shooting.
They have a son on active duty in the Army who has just returned from his first tour in Iraq.
It was good for them to shoot the same weapons their son uses everyday.
I also got 9 holes of golf in.
I have not golfed since I was diagnosed with PD and Dementia.
I even parred two holes!
I think I will go again, soon.
All in all, it was a wonderful time and I thank my Sister for lending me her family for 6 days.
Now I am looking forward to my son and his families visit in August.
We have more adventures planned.Family is important, it is refreshing, and it gives you strength.
They understood, as much as anyone can, my restrictions and limitations and tried not to overload me.
I did very well, thanks to their understanding and my Wife's constant care.
Which is really the topic of this writing.
My wife like so many other loving spouses faced with the issues of their spouses disease, has had some denial issues.
Yet, she has been supportive, loving, and caring.
But in the past month or so, Linda has really began to deal with this challenge and has taken the lead in my medical care and well being.
She has become very protective of me.
Making sure that  I am rested enough, fed well, and comfortable.
But most of all,  she is loving and gentle with me.
We have been married for over 37 years, and we have been through plenty.
Gee, I deployed to Viet Nam less that 8 weeks after we were married.
We had 7 major deployments and the numerous out and ins that make up shipboard life.
I moved her from her beloved home state, to Great Lakes, Illinois.
That's grounds for divorce alone.
As I have written before, we have bought, sold, and moved from more houses since I retired from the Navy than we did while we were on active duty.
We have owned more cars that "Little Joe's" used car dealership.
Linda has had to deal with my many faults, and always did so in a gracious, supportive, way.
She has a way of letting me know when I am wrong, comforting me when things have gone wrong, and rebuilt my foundations when they were shaken.
Now, as always, she has taken the lead as my cheer leader, medical advisor, care taker, and as always my best friend.
Our life has had it's bumps and ruts, but even with these medical challenges, I really can say, this is the best time of our lives.
Over 37 years ago, on a blind date, on Thanksgiving Day, GOD brought us together.
I am eternally thankful for that and I am eternally grateful for her help, love, and steadfast companionship.
I love my wife, and that says it all.

I know I have written about this before, but you must realize that this Blog is therapy for me also, and right now I need therapy, badly!
I will also try to clean up my emotional, Fleet sailor, language, but I am really frustrated with people who say to me, "there's nothing wrong with you".
"You're perfectly fine."
Or, "I am a nurse and you show no symptoms of Parkinson's or Dementia."
A nurse who lives in my complex actually told me that.
Well, first of all, I take more meds in a day than Tweedy Bird eats bird seeds.
My pill box is as big as a suitcase.
Second, would they rather I was filling my drawers, peeing in my pants, and drooling down my shirt in public?
I CAN accomodate them, very easily.
Ask my wife.
People see me when I am doing well, when the meds are working, when I am rested.
They don't have to clean the solid waste out of the shower when I have an "accident" while taking a shower.
They don't have to try to understand what I am saying when I am tired, frustrated, or my meds are at the end of their effective run.
They don't see me aspirate when I choke eating oat meal, and I turn blue from not breathing.It seems to me, if a well experienced Neurologist, a Clinical Psychologist with a PHD, the Office of Personnel Management, who approved my Civil Service disability, on the first submission, and the Social Security Administration, that approved my disability on the first submission, all without using a lawyer, all agree that I am ill, with a progressive disease that will lead to my early demise, who do these self proclaimed experts think they are.
Additionally, the Neurologist that the Veterans Administration sent me to for evaluation agreed that I had Parkinson's and Dementia and advised me to retire and try to enjoy the few good years I had left.
I did, thanks to OPM, Social Security, and our good financial management, take that advise, and I am retired.The 14 year old neurologist I have written about at UVA is leading towards Lewy Body Dementia, which has a far more aggressive prognosis.
Let's hope she is wrong.So, I have decided to stop being nice to people who treat me like a liar and RIP their faces off, kick them in their private parts, or be so foul and abusive that they are reduced to tears of embarrassment.
Sound too tough, too mean?
That's how I feel when I get no respect, am called a liar, or am discounted as a fraud.
And just remember one thing, I carry a cane and I know how to use it!Today, a woman in my apartment complex stopped me and said; You didn't use that cane when you first moved here, why do you use it now."
When I tried to explain the situation to her, she said; There's nothing wrong with you."
Like Ralph Kramden said: "One of these days, One of these days, POW, right in the kisser!!"
She is right, I don't use my cane all the time.
I don't have accidents in my skivies all the time either.Yes, I know people want to be nice and say; "Gee, you look good."
and I really do appreciate that.
You're being good friends, and understand some of my struggles.
But this attitude of; "I don't think your sick" is going to get stopped by me, one way or the other.
I have given up on getting sympathy from anyone, including family.
I am still expected to perform at the standard that I did at 21.
Well, I have a flash coming to that team also.
I ain't gonna do it, no more.
You have to realize that I am sick, I am not going to get better, I am going to get worse, and I do need your help, understanding, and support.
Some folks need to get past the Anger and Denial stages of grieving and get on with business.
I need that, and so do you.Yes, I am angry, upset, and hurt.
I do not take kindly to being called a liar, a goldbrick or a malingerer.
Do you?!
Probably not.
And, maybe, tomorrow morning I will regret writing this and retract it.
But, what's said is said.
And it is good to blow off some steam, sometimes.
And I don't have anyone I can vent to, but this Blog.
If I offended any of you, I am sorry to hurt you.
But take heed to what I have said.
I am emotionally bruised and it hurts.
And for my Navy friends, Yes I know where sympathy is in the dictionary.

I have added to the articles you can get to from this blog a very interesting article on Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep disorders.
Research has discovered that the part of the brain that is effected by Parkinson's and Lewy Body Dementia is the same area that stops us from acting out our dreams.
Since I have this disorder, I found this research very interesting.
The diagnosis and pin pointing of exactly what I have has been painfully slow and inexact.
Research like this, helps the professionals peel back another layer of the mystery.
Why do I and other sufferers of this maze of diseases care what the actual problem is.
That is an easy answer.
The treatment for Alzheimer's, Dementia's, all of them, and Lewy Body Dementia is a shotgun approach, just like cancer treatment was 20 or 30 years ago.
Now, I will admit, there is more available drugs to treat these diseases today than when my Father-in-Law had Alzheimer's 20 years ago.
But, if they can pin point the disease, then research can find the exact cause.
That will lead to treatment that is more precise and hopefully more helpful.
So, I will continue to ask questions, do research, and try to learn from those of you who are suffering from these diseases and from your wonderful caretakers.
Never give up, maybe the research will not help me or you, but think about the ones who come after us.
That's who we should work for now.

You may remember that a while ago, I had a problem acting out my violent dreams.
This led to two instances where I physically accosted my wife.
She was not seriously injured, but I brought it up to my Neurologist.
Her reply was, "I was expecting this."
She explained that it was because of the effect my dementia was having on my brain.
She further explained that the "normal" brain paralyzes the muscles during REM sleep.
REM sleep is when dreaming occurs.
In her words, that part of my brain was not broke.
She then prescribed a medicine called Clonazepam.
I don't know what it does, but I don't hit my wife anymore and that's good!
She really did not like sleeping in a catchers mask, even though I did get he a very comfortable one, It was the "Johnny Bench" model.
I call these pills my "don't hit Linda" pills.
And as I said, they seem to work.
My last visit to my neurologist, my wife discussed the continuing vivid, violent dreams that I continue to have.
What can I say, I led a violent life and I am reliving it in my dreams.
In any case, these dreams wake me up, three or four times a night.
It seems like, when the movie is over, (that is, the dream) I wake up.
Then I go back to sleep and have another feature length dream.
The neurologist suggested that I double the dose of the Clonazepam, to see if that reduced the dreaming.
I started the new dosage last Thursday.
I can honestly tell you I sleep all night through.
I still dream, I just don't wake up.
Nothing wakes me up.
Thursday night my wife came to bed well after me, got another blanket out of the closet, put it on the bed, switched it's position because she had it on wrong, and all through this event, I never stirred.
OK, this seems like a good deal.
At least I am sleeping through the night.Today, all I wanted to do was sleep.
I woke up at 0800, drank some coffee, had some toast, took my morning meds, and went back to bed by 0930.
I stayed in bed until 2:30PM.
I finally got up and ate lunch, walked the dog, got the mail, but that was the extent of my energy.
We were supposed to go to a Church gathering this evening, but I could not deal with the thought of a large number of people.
So, we stayed home.Now, I am not saying it is related to the increase of my "Don't Hit Linda" drug, but it bears watching.
In the past, recently, I have had increasing problems with crowds, noise, and commotion.
So, this may just be that problem increasing.
But, this has been a very introspective and introverted day.
We will see what tomorrow brings.

Well, let me update you from my last post.
You will recall that I was anything but pleased with the treatment I received at UVA.
I sent a rather informative, polite, but pointed email to the Clinical Neuropsychologist (PHD) man child explaining that I did not appreciate them not doing their homework before I drove 3 hours and stayed overnight at the reduced rate of $110/night, plus tax.
Not to mention the fact that he wanted me to get the results of past testing from my doctor.
Aren't we all connected by the Internet these days?!
I also dropped a copy of that email off at my Neurologist's office.
Well, Friday I received a telephone call from the PHD and he was surprised at my rantings.
I guess I should have blown up in his face.
Trust me, next time I will.
But I was nice and he apologized and said he would now do his homework and wanted a chance to make this right.
I agreed, so we will meet again an a couple of weeks.
Then, Saturday morning, at 0930, the 14 year old called me!
She was less apologetic and acted like someone made her call, probably her mother.
But, just the same, she admitted they messed up.
The surprise to me was, she did not even know she had a Wednesday appointment with me.
If I was not retired, I would go out there and square their office away!
So, sometime in July, I will make the trek to UVA one more time.
If they don't do me right this time, I am going to the hospital administrator.
I hope he is over 21.

What a whirlwind trip!
Our trip to Iowa was nothing short of fantastic.
We were treated like long lost family, which we were, from the moment we rang the door bell at our hosts home.
What a warm reception.
Remember this couple, the husband is 94 and the wife is 89!
They still drive, keep house, cook, go to church, and host family reunions with 30 people in attendance.
Oh, did I mention she makes homemade ice cream and candy?!
Every meal was a home made taste delight.
The house was hospital clean, and the fellowship as warm, rewarding, and very special.
We met more wonderful people than I can remember.
Linda spent a long time working on family tree discoveries with two of her cousins.
I saw them sharing information, pictures, and notes about family births, deaths, and birth places.
One of the cousin's husband also had Parkinson's.
He and I bonded almost immediately.
He also loves automobiles and is fun to be with.
He started a rumor that he and I got Parkinson's from our wives, who are of the same family tree!
Makes sense to me.
Our host also had a regulation pool table in his basement.
Sunday night, he gave me lessons!
He can play pool, not for a man of 94, almost 95, but he can play pool that would make a pool shark cry!
Wow!
It was good that we left for home on Monday, because it was apparent that we were wearing them out just a little.
But we will be back, and soon.Upon our return, I had an appointment with my neurologist here in Virginia Beach.
It was a good visit and I came away feeling cared for and content with my progress.
I really do like and respect my neurologist.
I believe her aggressive treatment of my condition has bought me some time, slowed my memory decline, and helped me get ready for the future.
That was Tuesday.
After that visit, we made the trek to UVA to see the 14 year old Neurologist that thinks she is a research doctor.
She had cognitive skills testing scheduled for me to start at 0830 on Wednesday.
We got to Charlottsville at 10PM and finally got to sleep around midnight.
We were right on time fr the testing and there were no real surprises.
I have been through this series of tests twice before.
I will say, that this series of tests lacked some of the tests that my local neurologist uses.
Just the same, it was OK.
The I me with the Psychologist with the PHD.
That is also normal, I see one here.
He asked all the usual questions and had the usual answers.
What made me angry was that he had not reviewed my record and did not have my previous test results from my home neurologist.
I was supposed to see the 14 year old at 2 PM.
The PHD decided that would be a waste of time, since he would not have time to decode the tests I had taken today and also, he did not have the other tests to compare them too!
Does anyone do their homework anymore.
To top that off, he had the audacity to ask ME to call my neurologist and have her fax the files to him.
THAT WILL BE THE DAY!!
He and the 14 year old get paid big money to do their job, and that includes preparing for my visit.
I did not make these appointments, they did.
I did not co-locate the appointments, they did.
This will be the last time I spend $110 for a hotel room and $40 worth of gas to be exposed to two kids playing doctor at my expense!
It took me the three hour drive back to Virginia Beach and two hours at home to calm down enough to write this.
Tomorrow I am going to stop in and see my neurologist and tell her what I think of this so called research neurologist.
And that opinion is not good.
I have little patience for people who are supposed to be professionals, that do not do their homework!
I also intend to write a letter to the UVA Medical Center and flame spray their organization, or lack of.
It was apparent that no one was in charge.So, good family reunion, one more bad medical event.
If I was a professional baseball player, batting .500 would be pretty good.One other funny note.
I drove when we went out and the 94 year old rode in the front.
I would have to remind him to put his seat belt on.
He would always comment; " If you don't have confidence in your driving, I'm not going to argue."
I thought that about said it all!

This is the first time Linda and I have traveled since my problems have progressed.
We are going to fly to Iowa, to meet some "Live" relatives that she has never met before.
This should be real interesting.
The person we are staying with knew Linda's father when he came over from Germany in 1927.
She was 7 years old.
That makes her, let's see, OLD!
And the lady and her husband still live on their farm!
I hope there's more than one bathroom.Travel has always been a bit uncomfortable but now, taking me out of my routine, my comfort zone, is problematic.
I won't even have Marcel the wonder dog with me to keep me calm.
But, this is a good test.
It is a short trip, frantic, what I used to call a "Surgical Strike".
We will see how I do and how she handles my problems with environment, time, and confusion.
I won't even know where the coffee pot is!
!We went to a presentation on Dementia last Tuesday that was very informative and provided some answers.
The two health professionals talked about many of the issues that I am experiencing.
I thought, in my own way, I am normal!!
That is, I am experiencing the same things others with dementia and Alzheimer's do.
For instance, at night, noise really causes me to become agitated.
Watching TV, when they increase the volume for the commercials, and it keeps getting louder, each commercial at a time.
I really get angry, almost uncontrollably so.
Well, that is normal, for my condition.
There, the world is messed up, not me!
We also got connected to a support group that meets once a month.
We will miss the June meeting but we will be sure to make the July meeting, I hope.So, we are off, on our trip, not our rockers, I hope.
I will let you know how it went when we return.
Oh, by the way, after we return, I have an appointment the next day with my neurologist, then we drive to UVA for a 4 hour cognitive skills test and an appointment with the 14 year old neurologist on the next day.
Wow, what a whirlwind.

After my last post, someone commented that I was independent and hard headed, or words to that effect.
They also commented that that was typical for Gunner's Mates.
I gave those words some very serious reflection, and I have came to the conclusion, that they are right!
Every successful Gunner's Mate that I ever knew was independent, decisive, hard headed, and would not give up or let anyone help him.
In a combat situation, or just leading men in gunnery exercises, small arms training, magazine safety, ammunition handling, line handling, underway replenishment, any dangerous situation, that head Strong determination is a good thing to have.
When I was the leading Gunner's Mate in any situation, from the time I was a GMG3, there was not doubt about who was in charge!Now, however, it is becoming painfully obvious that I am not in total command of what is happening.
My body moves where IT wants to, all too many times.
My mind can't recall those facts that I used to be so quick with, like what day it is or where I am.
And sometimes, my body forgets that I am not sitting on the toilet.
A new surprise that this challenge has provided me in recent weeks.
My reaction to all of these changes, up to this time has been to, in my own way, deny that I am having these problems, put on a front, live in "Show Time" as I have discussed before.
This actually has caused me more frustration than the disease itself.
For every one's sake, I try to be "Normal".
Well, I am not "Normal",  I am me, and this is where I am at this time.
So, from this point on, I am not going to be so independent and hard headed.
I am going to let people help me more.
I am going to let you see what is really happening.
My wife knows, for the most part, but I even shield her from some things.
But not anymore.
I believe it is time to be honest and open about everything that is going on.
Those of you who read my blog often are probably saying, how much more honest and open can he be?
The issue is not with what I tell you, it is with what I let people see.
I was on that ladder, with a big reciprocating saw because for me not to be on the ladder would make me admit I was not the man I used to be.
For someone who believes in "Macho", that's a hard step to take.
In my demented mind, I'm still the same tough, gristly, salty, Gunner's Mate I was at 20.
I still think I can kick some one's but!
Boy is that a fantasy.So, from now on, I promise to be more honest and open with myself, and those around me.
I'm not going to give up, I'm just going to scale back, based on the progression of what ever they finally decide I have.
And to the person who provided me that feedback and insight, thanks!!
I needed it and I know it was offered in love and care.
</doc>
<doc date=Thursday, May 27, 2010>
Things had settled into a fairly comfortable routine.
I was learning to deal with where I was on the progression scale of my issues.
At church, we finally decided to tear down the old shed.
I ordered the dumpster and last Saturday, we really got a good start thanks to many folks efforts and a rental reciprocating saw from Home Depot.
Wednesday, the Pastor and I rented another saw and got to work cutting more panels down and dropping the roof rafters.
That's when I got in trouble.
The extension ladder was leaning on the roof joice, and I was cutting rafters.
Yes, I can hear all of you saying, what were you doing on a ladder?!
Hey, I felt good, and it felt good to be doing something physical and useful.
In any case, I cut the joice, the joice collapsed and the ladder, the saw and me, fell about 12 feet!..
The ladder got the worst of it, it is bent beyond repair.
The saw made it OK, and I did too.
Actually, it was fun.
Yes, fun!
I was alive again, doing something.
I got up and kept working, for another hour or so.
Yes the Pastor was concerned.
But I assured him I was perfectly OK, and I am.
A little sore this morning, but no lasting damage.
And I still think it was fun.
My complaint is, I am OK falling off a ladder, but my wife and my neurologist won't let me drive a race car with Richard Petty's Driving Experience.
I think I will sneak out and do it anyway!On a more somber note, we had to have our cat, Missy, put down today.
She was 18 years old.
Her kidneys failed, she lost 33% of her body weight in about two weeks, and this morning she could not walk.
She had a good, long life.
She survived cancer surgery almost ten years ago.
Our Vet did not think she would live 6 months after that surgery.
She lived almost ten very good years after that surgery and she was spoiled every day of them.
Just the same, this was very sudden and my wife and I are in shock.
It seem surreal, like a bad dream.
We both loved Missy and will miss her.
Because of my condition, we have decided not to get any more pets.
The stress of loosing them is just too difficult for either of us.
The emotional investment is just too much.
We still have our miniature poodle.
He is seven and doing quite well.
I am sure he will miss Missy too.
We rescued her from the street, 18 years ago.
She was starving to death, skinny, and scared.
We actually got caught climbing under our State Trooper neighbors police car, trying to catch her.
He said, "I hope you have a good reason to be messing with that car!"
He saw that we did and helped us corral her.
She was a lovely and loving part of our family, and she will leave a hole that cannot be filled.
Good bye Missy, I love you.

My wife and I have recently noticed a marked decrease in my mental abilities.
My bad dreams are increasing in intensity and number, interrupting my sleep.
My anger and frustration  at the world around me has increased.
No I have not lashed out at anyone, but I want to.
Even my mobility is decreasing and I find myself stumbling more and nearly falling while just standing.
I was reminded by my wife tonight that I write this blog to chronicle my progress for my mental well being and for others to see.
We have even began to discuss participating in a study to see if what I am going through can't be used to help others.
Sort of being a live "Test Dummy" for medicine!
I am OK with that.
But what I am not OK with is my friends and acquaintances doubting my disease.
SO, I will explain what happens when you see me acting normal.
I recommend that you go to the Lewy Body Association's WEB site and look at the FORUM sections.
There are a couple of good articles describing "Show Time".
It seem, at the stage that I am at in my disease, that I can carry on normal or near normal conversations, making you believe that I am completely following what you are saying, and making sensible statements.
That period of time of relative normal cognition is called "Show Time".
Not my term, but what the medical field calls it.
Many times, after we have talked, I will not remember what we talked about, or even if we talked.
My personal perspective is that this "Show Time" comes from an inner desire to appear normal.
We all have that desire.
Remember High School?!
Or, why don't non-Christian people swear in church?
The answer to that is it is not expected of us, so if we did swear, we would not look normal in our environment.
I could write a thesis on this topic just based on walking around a Navy Combat ship with a Chaplain.
As you approach, before they see the Chaplain, there is cussing, crude jokes and stories, maybe even some Playboy magazines out.
When the men recognized the Chaplain, the cussing and stories stop and the magazines disappear.
It did not matter what denomination Chaplain it was.
It always happened that way.
I am experiencing this "Show Time", and from my research, most Dementia sufferers, are the same way.
In later stages, we don't realize what is normal or expected, and therefore stop trying to meet that unattainable standard of the outside world.
But trust me, I am struggling to maintain what is left of my status quo.
My wife drives more, I don't go out at night,  I don't want to do much, and I have troubles remembering the simplest things, like what day it is.
I spend a lot of my mental time in the past, thinking about my Navy days, early married days, and even my childhood.
I credit my Family Doctor and my Neurologist for recognizing what was happening to me early enough to get me on medications that would maintain my ability to express myself, understand some of what's happening to me, and give me time to slowly slide into the latter stages of this disease.
My wife's father had Alzheimer's.
His wife covered it up for a long time, and after her death, and the shock of that to his mental ability, we all recognized, way too lat, that  he was in trouble.
Of course, the medicines that I am taking did not exist when he was alive, so I am blessed and so is my family.
At work, the first person to notice what was happening with me was the real brains of the Search Radar Branch, Don Bolick.
Since he and I worked so closely together he first caught the little mental mistakes, the lost knowledge, the inability to do my job effectively.
I could "Fake it" with others, but not him.
We were and still are that close.
I guess the purpose of writing this posting is two fold.
To let everyone know what I am really going through and to thank you for caring enough to wish I was really OK.  And the fact is, I am in good shape for the shape that I'm in.
I will never be better than I am today, and I will get worse before this is over.
Everyone needs to understand that and let me deal with this disease on my terms.
I don't want to appear mean, ungrateful, or disrespectful.
I love each one of you.
But I am dealing with a terminal, progressive, disease.
That's the fact that we all have to face, together.

<doc date=Sunday, May 9, 2010>
Regardless of what the medical profession decides the final name of my disease is, Lewy Body Dementia, Parkinson's with Dementia, Alzheimer's, Frontal Lobe Dementia, what ever, it is progressing and I see it from within way more that people see it from the outside.
Lately, I have noticed a severe depression every night, starting when the sun goes down and lasting until I go to sleep.
It colors my mood, my thoughts, my desire to do anything.
Anything I watch on TV that is the least bit tense, sends me deeper into this darkness.
I feel hopeless, alone, deserted, and worthless every evening.
Sometimes, I can escape into my memories of the past, most times I cannot.
I feel like I desperately need to cry, but I cannot.
I want to scream, but I don't.
I find myself staying up later and later.
When I go to sleep, I dream vivid dreams that resemble real life.
Sometimes they are good and comforting, but lately they too have been depressing and emotionally stressful.
I write this because I know some who read this Blog are caretakers of individuals with the same issues.
I am asking for advice, insight, and help.During the day, the majority of the time, I fell good, on an emotional even keel, and in control of myself.
But I am beginning to dread when the sun goes down.
Any input would be appreciated.
Thanks.

As I said in my previous post, GOD'S timing is perfect and we need to have the faith to trust HIM completely.
When the prospective buyer of our home said they wanted to close on 5 May, a mere two weeks from the contract being offered, everyone shook their heads in disbelief.
Today, at 2PM, we signed the legal documents closing the sale of our home.
Done, Complete!
This is a huge stress removed from our minds.
We have been worried, without cause, over this sale.
Remember, we moved to our retirement apartment in early March.
When we signed the lease for our apartment in February, the house was not even on the market.
Not to mention the terrible housing market issues.
But, GOD brought us a wonderful realtor who worked endlessly to sell our home.
She even planted azaleas and flowers, HERSELF, to enhance our homes curb appeal.
Now that's a dedicated professional!So, as of today, we are debt free, living in a perfect community, without stress, having a great time, and ready to enjoy the rest of the good time that GOD gives us.
Yes, I still have mental and physical issues that are annoying.
Yes, they are progressively getting worse.
But, I am having the time of my life.
Linda and I really enjoy being retired.
The freedom to do what we want, when we want.
We have a trip to Iowa planned for this summer top meet some relatives that we did not even know existed.
We even plan on going to the Barrett-Jackson Car auction in Scottsdale, Arizona next January.
If you are a car "Nut", you will know what I am talking about.
Do I have issues, yes.
Are we going to let my physical and mental issues dictate what we do or how we feel.
No!
We plan on letting GOD show us the way.By the way, if you live in the Hampton Roads area of Virginia, and need a realtor, Ms Faye Ninos of Wainwright Realty is the best!
!More later.

If you have been keeping up with our move to our retirement retreat, you know that one big worry was the sale of our home.
You know this is a slow real estate market and not the best time to be selling, even with the $8000 tax break the federal government is offering.
We have had our home on the market since February.
We have had plenty of people looking at our home, but no real offers.
We had been told that we were the "Second Choice" for a number of buyers, but still no offers.
At the advice of our agent, we lowered our price a number of times, but no offers still.
With the pending end of the $8000 tax credit, I was beginning to worry.
Oh ME of little faith!
Last Tuesday we received an offer that was very fair and we were ecstatic.
The buyers need to close quickly and were already approved for their loan.
The home inspection and termite inspections were Thursday, I said they were in a hurry.
The appraisal will probably be this week.
All is moving very smoothly and very quickly.
You may ask, why is everything going so fast now?
Because this is when GOD had it planned for the house to sell and this is the family HE had planned to live in this home and benefit from all of the improvements HE enabled us to make on the house.
I suffer, like many of you, from wanting to be in charge of everything, all the time.
GOD has HIS plans and they are perfect.
HIS timing is perfect.
I need to be faithful enough and smart enough to let HIM solve my problems.
If I worry, it will not make anything better.
I cannot add one day to my life by worrying.
So, I shouldn't.
This move, and the sale of our home has taught me this lesson as never before.
When we are at our weakest, GOD is at his strongest, if we will only let HIM be.

Many of you know that Linda and I moved, very abruptly, to an over 55 apartment.
It was a decision we thought and prayed about for quite a while, but just could not come to a decision about.
Then, one day in January, we decided, very quickly, to rent an apartment in this wonderful community that we watch  as it was built.
Now, I must admit, the speed at which we moved is completely out of character for either of us.
But we believe it is what GOD had planned for us.
Since we moved in the first week of March, each day has been better, we have been more relaxed, and we have enjoyed life more fully.
There are paths around lakes for walking.
Benches and a screened in gazebo to relax in, a club house, a well equipped Fitness Center, a pool, that will soon open for the season, and... well, you get the idea.
But what really makes this complex so beneficial to us is the staff.
Of course, there have been a few minor things that leaked, did not work correctly, or needed adjusted, in our apartment.
The maintenance staff quickly and efficiently addressed each issue.
Today, I asked for help installing a medicine cabinet in the master bath.
Just as scheduled, one of the wonderful maintenance folks came and helped me, really installed, the cabinet.
There just seems to be no end to their helpfulness.
We moved here because it was becoming more and more difficult for us to maintain our home as I addressed in past blogs.
Here, there is no worry.
The staff will come to the rescue!
If you or your parents are considering retirement living, please consider an over 55 complex for them, or you.
Do your homework, read the reviews online, talk to the residents already there.
But don't think that home ownership is the only path to happiness in retirement.
Specially if you or your parents have disability issues.
It is nice to feel free to lock the door and go see the grand kids, or travel to where ever, not having to worry about the lawn, a broken pipe, or anything else.
For us, this is real freedom.
If you want the name of our complex, email me, and I will gladly give you the info.Two bumper stickers come to mind.
The first; "Whoever dies with the most toys, wins!"
and the second:  "If you die, we are splitting up your gear."
It's not things that make you rich, it's friends.
And when your time on earth is done, what you have accumulated will go to people who won't even remember you ten years from now.
Trust GOD for your future, Trust Jesus for your salvation, and Trust the Holy Spirit for your advice in life.
You will be much happier.
I promise!

Sorry, I have not added to this Blog for a number of days.
Time passes faster retired.
The final pieces are in place in the apartment, after being without a couch for a month, our new sofa was delivered today.
One thing is for sure, I am never moving that sleeper sofa myself!
It weighs a ton.
It is the new one with the sleep number mattress.
I may have made a mistake.
Making company too comfortable is always a mistake.
Just joking.
With the arrival of the couch, I could put up the last of the art work in the living room.
So, with that, we are finally all moved in.
Of course, the house is not sold yet, but I still truly believe GOD will take care of that issue.
We have had a lot of people looking at the house and we have been a number of folks second choice.
But, in this market, number two is not good enough.
We have been getting plenty of exercise with the warmer weather.
The canoe has been busy, and the dog is getting tired of walks!
He actually laid down during a walk at a local park today, as if to say; "That's it, I've had enough!"
My cane is now my constant companion as I see more and more problems keeping my balance.
Sometimes, it just feels like the room moved.
If we lived in San Diego I would blame earthquakes.
It's not a big deal, just an annoyance.
Just like so many other parts of my disease.
I find that I am mentally, pretty well off in the morning, after I have had a couple cups of coffee and a good while to wake up.
I take afternoon naps most of the time, but I still find that my mental ability and my emotional stability seem to go down considerably in the evening.
Again, I think that is normal for what I am going through.
But it is annoying.
My wife continues to try to keep me mentally engaged and is continually looking at my condition from the positive side.
That helps me, because all of the "paper cuts" wear on you after a while.So, while the major stress of the move seems to be past, and we seem to be settled, I find that I have not rebounded to my mental capacity or my physical ability that I had before the move.
I guess the neurologist was right.
She's good!

<doc date=Sunday, March 21, 2010>
One of the frustrations I and many other sufferers of neurological disorders have is the up and down progression of our diseases.
Whether my final diagnosis is Parkinson's with Dementia, Alzheimer's, or Lewy Body Dementia, is of no matter to me, other that the final diagnosis will help me plan the rest of my useful life and make me aware of new drugs and treatments that are specific to what ever disease I have.
But each of these, and it is looking more and more like Lewy Body Dementia, have an up and down progression.
That is, you will feel realty good for a period of time and then take a decided down turn and stay at that level until the next shift.
Each UP is not as high as the last one but each down is lower than the one before.
In the beginning, and trust me, I am still in the first Tri-Mester of this pregnancy, I liked the good times.
I enjoyed feeling good and actually questioned if I was sick.
I remember once, and only once, I actually convinced my neurologist to let me quit taking my meds.
Boy, was that a serious mistake.
The symptoms came back with a vengeance.
But lately, I have come to truly dislike, and even hate, the good periods.
First of all, it raises questions in my Protestant work ethic mind that I am not sick and that I am malingering.
Of course, I know that is not true, but my demented mind makes me question my own sanity.
Then, the good times only remind me that another down turn is on the way.
That has recently happened.
I had a pretty good week last week.
My balance was good, I was mentally alert, and my depression was for the most part, under control.
Then yesterday hit.
I had issues with hallucinations, depression, and my balance was way off, to the point that I am back using my cane.OK, I am whining a little bit.
But I think it would be easier if this condition just took a nice, predictable, slow, steady, path into oblivion.
Instead, I am up one day and down the next.
It drives me crazy.
I know that others who suffer from this malaise have the same experiences and I am interested in your prospective and how you and your care giver handle the issues of up and down.
I look forward to your insight.
Thanks for your support, it really does help!

Linda and I have been settling into our new apartment.
It has been stressful as I have discussed.
The house still has not sold, so that is weighing on my mind, and the prospect of proving that I am sick to another doctor is upsetting to me and my wife.
But, Spring has sprung!
The weather was great today!
No rain, 73 degrees, and we decided not to work on finding a place for everything and go canoeing!
We went to a Lake we had not been on called Lake Smith, and it was wonderful.
The lake is big, serene, with few power boats and a plethora of wild life to observe.
I love to look at turtles and they were out sunning themselves everywhere.
The geese were fighting over mating territory and they were fun to watch.
We spent over an hour and a half, rowing across this majestic lake.
It was relaxing and it recharged our batteries.
It was much needed.
Yes, I am sore and I will admit, I had problems getting out of the canoe because I locked up.
But it was fun!
We have to remember that we retired early, to enjoy time together while I am still healthy enough to be fun.
Today was a perfect example.
Yes, there were things to do at the house and the apartment.
But they will wait until the weather is not good enough for canoeing.
Today was GOD's gift to us.
Thanks Father.

I told you that I had a consultation with a neurologist at the University of Virginia, ordered/ recommended by my neurologist.
Well that visit was today.
All the stress of the move, trying to sell our house, retiring, and now this!
Linda and I are both JUST recovering from bad colds, but we went, spent the night, and made the appointment at 2:30 PM.
I knew this neurologist was also a female, that's OK, no issue for me.
But I was expecting someone with some experience, maturity, presence, from a research university medical center.
Nope, not this time, in walks a 14 year old, 4'11'' tall, wearing corfam doctor's shoes!
I swear!!
Not only do I have underwear older that this girl, I was wearing it!
Now, I will give her credit, she did spend over an hour with us, but that's because the hands on her Play School Clock don't move on their own!
Remember that "Play Doctor" toy kit you got when you were two with the stethoscope that really worked and the little plastic hammer.
That's what she was using.
I thought the purpose of this visit was to confirm what my, rather seasoned private practitioner of neurology, has observed and tested for over three years.
I got the idea she did not believe I was sick, that my symptoms were faked, and I was an overall malingering gold brick.
I expected her to call General Patton in to slap me with his gloves!
!OK, now you have the scene cemented in your mind.
I swear, this is all true.
Now she wants me to drive three hours back to UVA to redo the Cognitive Skills Tests, with her Clinical Psychologist, That should be a trip.
How old is this doctor?
Will I use a crayon or finger paints to mark the blocks?
Will there be a nap time in the middle of the testing?
Through all this humor, you may detect some frustration, and that's true.
I HATE being treated like I am not sick, and that I am trying to beat the system.
In general, I am really pissed off!.
But, I will do the tests just to prove my point.
This is not turning out anything like I thought it would.
More to come.

Things are starting to come together.
We even cooked a meal last night!
Yes, we still have a few boxes to unpack, and some art work to hang, but it is really starting to look like home.
Marcel, the wonder dog, is doing much better.
I think he has figured out this is a "No Bark Zone".We finished cleaning the house yesterday.
It looks fantastic.
It is as clean as anyone could possible want.
Now all we need is a buyer.
The yard sale is Saturday and the open house is Sunday.
GOD will surprise us, of this I am sure.This morning is the first time I have been alone in the apartment.
My wife has gone to her Bible Study Fellowship, that meets every Thursday.
So I have the run of the place.
Well, Marcel and I.  I have installed two window valances in the guest room and that's about it.
I think I will rest until she comes home.I have met some very nice folks here, many are retired military.
Imagine that, in Tidewater!
It is very quiet and the apartments seem to be extremely well sound proofed.
I think this is going to be a good home.
I have noticed that my mental abilities have taken a measurable decrease.
My wife has also noticed.
We will see if that is temporary or not.
It may be from the stress of the move, but it may plateau at this level also.
Only time will tell.
I will keep you informed.This Blog is as therapeutic for me as I hope it is informative to those who read it.
I intend to continue this as long as I can.
More later.

Well, I promised I would continue to update you on the progress of what I am now calling; "The Last Move!"
This is a lot harder and more emotionally draining that I had ever expected.
I have been overwhelmed by emotions, doubts of the wisdom of this move, and worry.
Depression is my constant companion.
I am getting more worn out and more emotional as time wears on.
My wife, bless her, is working diligently at making our apartment an orderly home.
She is placing everything in a logical location so it will best fit both of us.
I am almost unable to help her.
We did go back to the house today and start cleaning and packing up most of what is left.
I believe one more load in my trusty Subaru Forrester will get it.
Doing manual work always helps me when I am overwhelmed.
But, my physical limitations make that hard to do.
Just the same, WE got plenty done today.
I would not be ashamed if someone looked at the house today.
We still desperately need a buyer.
But I believe that is in GOD'S hands.As far as my doubts about the wisdom of this move.
I discussed this with my wife today and she assured me that this was the RIGHT thing to do at the correct time.
SO, since I am not thinking straight, I will defer to her judgment.
I told he I was ready to paint the entire house out, inside, replace the carpet, and move back in.
She did not agree.
Most likely she is right.
But the emotional roller coaster that I am on is terrifying.I am also noticing more weakness in my arms and legs.
Friday and Saturday, I felt very good and stronger that I have in a long time.
That has passed.
My mental alertness is also diminishing.
I took a nap this afternoon to try to refresh.
It did not work.
Both of these symptom swings are common with PD with Dementia and LBD.
If I have not mentioned it, I have a consultation at UVA Medical on Monday.
My neurologist wants a second opinion.
I expect the doctor to tell me I am ugly also.
That would be a second opinion!My little poodle friend, Marcel had a better day, of sorts.
The sonic bark controller did not work, so, I purchased one of those collars that shock the dog  when he barks.
He has finally agreed to reduce his barking when we are both gone.
We were able to go shopping for a hour today and when we returned, he was quiet and calm.
We immediately took the collar off, praised him for being a good boy and I took him for a long walk.
Hopefully positive reinforcement for his good behavior will also hep him control his barking and whining for me when I am gone.
I realize it is annoying for the neighbors.
But they need to let him get acclimated also.That's the update for now.
More later.

Well, All of our possessions are in one place!
It took six days, and the help of some very dedicated friends from our Church, my Search Radar Branch team, and my best friend Jerry and his family.
But we made it.
We finally got to, actually found our bed, at 11PM last night.
Then, our 18 year old cat decided to spend the night telling us she did not appreciate our moving without her permission.
My mistake!
Now we are in the "Where does  this go?"
mode.
Most things fit, some will go in the yard sale, others to charity.
Of course, our rule has always been, friends have first selection.
This has been a far more traumatic and mentally draining move that I could have imagined.
It used to be, we could do this move in one day, unpack the next, and be ready to go to work.
Now, I am too tired to do anything and my wife is working double time!
She is a wonderful wife, friend, and love.
I hope she keeps me.
My Neurologist was right when she told Linda and I to make this move now!
I do not know how we could have done this with me in any worse condition.
But, GOD was gracious, and HIS timing is always right.
It certainly was this time.Then there is the problem of my dear friend, Marcel the miniature poodle.
He likes to be with me, all the time.
In our house, I did not know if he barked and whined when both of us were gone or not.
But a neighbor has already let me know that Marcel whines and barks when I am gone.
I am hoping that it is the new environment and he will stop, soon.
I also bought one of those sonic "Dog Bark" training devices.
The dog next door stopped barking, but Marcel still seems to get his two cents in when someone knocks at the door.
We will see if Marcel or the Neighbor get trained.
I would HATE to have to find him a new home.
I really love that little dog.
But, we are not moving again.I promise to expand on the experiences of this move when my energy levels increase.
Thanks for your prayers ans support.

Remember being 14, and being in LOVE with that cute girl, but she does not even notice you.
You are heart broken, confused, angry, sad, hurt, and you are SURE, nobody in the history of the world has ever felt that way before!
All of us have had that experience, hundreds of times in our lives.
We could not talk to Mom or Dad.
Our older siblings teased us, our friends used our problems against us.
We were ALONE in the world!
No one to help us.
They couldn't help because they could not possibly understand what I am going through!
Well, that explains the emotions that have gone through over the past two years since being diagnosed with Parkinson's and Dementia.
Not all the time, but on those quiet evenings, alone in my thoughts, or when I awake before my wife,  I thought, everyone tried to understand, but they can't.
Well, I am here to tell you, I was wrong.
Each of you who read my Blog, interface with me everyday, put up with my  insecurities and moodiness, and love me, really DO understand what I am going through!
I am NOT alone!
I have found that many of my friends and many wonderful people that I have never personally met but who read this Blog, do care about me and do understand my illness, my emotions, and my fears!
I have learned that many of you have done research on PD and Dementia, not to expand your knowledge base, but to help me!
I was wrong!!!
I am not alone!!!
I have never been alone!
I have never been so glad, so happy, so blessed to be wrong in my life!
!So, first of all, let me apologize for being SO wrong.
Second, let me thank each of you for being the best friends, the best support group, the best family, anyone could have.
God has blessed me and I know that there is nothing that can defeat us.
I am strong, capable, happily looking forward, to the future because of the support each of you give me.
I realized this tonight, after discussing a number of things with my wife, that happened today as I visited the folks at work.
It was reinforced after my best friend, who himself is going through some serious health issues, called me to discuss helping with our move.
It was solidified when I realized how wonderful, responsible, and loving my son is and how worried he is about my well being.
With a support group like this one, I am Superman!So, while I realize there will be tough days, days of depression, and issues, (remember, I am a realist) I can still depend on each of you for support because you DO know what I am going through and moreover, you DO care!
Wow!!
Thanks, I love each one of you!
God Bless each of you.

The packing has begun!
In our many moves, most of them since I retired from the Navy, and most of them for reasons I now don't remember, my wife has always packed our china first.
I remember proudly buying that Nortake China set on my first WESTPAC cruise.
As it turns out, it is a limited edition set, only made for military export.
But it is precious because it was the first thing I bought for our life together.
You will remember we got married and I deployed to Viet Nam almost immediately.
My wife lived in a furnished apartment in Whittier California while she completed her Bachelor's Degree at BIOLA college.
(Now BIOLA University) In any case, the china represents us together, and it is cherished by both of us.
My wife always packs our china and takes loving care in protecting each piece.
But the packing of the china signifies the beginning of the move!
It is like the lighting of the Olympic flame at the beginning of the Olympiad.
So, while we don't take possession of our new apartment until March 1, the move has officially begun.While both of us are excited about moving into our new apartment,  a place more suited for my issues, I can't help but have some reservations and depression about this move.
This move, is probably the last move we will make willingly.
All of our moves, even my Navy moves, we had a hand in the decision making.
I negotiated orders when I was in the Navy, trying to get the right jobs to help me promote while having some fun along the way.
After we retired from the Navy, we moved from house to house, looking for better neighborhoods, schools, locations closer to our Son and his family, or what ever whim happened to move me.
My wife always has taken my wanderlust with a remarkable measure of calm and composure.
I am sure that she would have been happy to stay in any one of our homes.
After all, they were all nice, comfortable, secure, safe, and located in a good neighborhood with all the modern conveniences.
But I have dragged my wife all over the Tidewater area in the last 27 years.
We have lived in Virginia Beach, Chesapeake, (three places) Norfolk, and back to Virginia Beach.
The china has been packed up more times than I care to count.
But she never complains.
She is truly amazing and frankly, I owe her an apology for making all of these moves.But, like I said, this is most likely the last move I will orchestrate and I am sad.
Sad, because I caused her to move so many times, for no good reasons.
And sad, because I know where this all leads.
Yes, this is a good move for all the best reasons.
Heck, I get tired starting the lawn mower, well enough mowing the lawn.
Yesterday, I used my drill to tighten some screws on the dinning room chairs, and I broke a sweat!
No, moving to a home where I do not have to do the maintenance is the RIGHT move.
Me on a ladder makes no sense at all.
I am dangerous in the attic!!
But, I also know what the next move holds.
No body looks forward to deteriorating mentally or physically, and I am doing both!
We ignore the fact of our own demise throughout most of our lives.
Some of us get plastic surgery, Botox, VIAGRA,     We have LASIK surgery so we don't have to wear glasses, die our hair, and  have Liposuction.
But sooner or later, our deteriorating body catches up with us.
Mine has just become a reality earlier than most.
As a friend of mine says, "It is what it is.
"So, as we pack, move, and unpack, don't be too surprised if I am a little misty, sad, moody, or depressed.
I believe GOD still has some things for me to do, but I know the time I have to accomplish that list is getting very short and my abilities are beginning to wane.
I wish I could remember exactly how President Regan said it, when he wrote his letter to America, explaining his Alzheimer's.
He was so eloquent and uplifting.
But the basis of his letter was, he was on a slow journey into the unknown, and so am I.

My wife and I, along with my son and his wonderful wife, have been able to make some life's decisions concerning where my wife and I will live.
I know, at least I think I know, that I have addressed in the past, our desire to make our lives simpler.
Get rid of home ownership responsibilities for me and my wife.
We discussed this with my neurologist during my January visit and she agreed that NOW was the time to make the move.
Why, because I need to get used to where I am, I need routine, and as my Dementia progresses, the unknown will be even harder to deal with.
We also discussed this with an "Elder Law Attorney and he agreed with our reasoning.
In any case, there is this new construction "over 55" complex that we have had our eyes on.
But, we were having difficulty making the final decision.
One day last week, we were out and about, and we visited another apartment complex, that is not "Over 55" that is close to the beach.
I will admit, the complex is beautiful, wonderfully maintained, and equipped with all the class "A" amenities.
But, it was not "Over 55" and did not have the handicap access I knew I needed.
Just the same, we liked them.
So, I asked my wife if we could revisit the community we liked.
She agreed and we quickly drove over to them.
We have been looking at these places so long that the staff knows us by name.
It just so happened that they had only one apartment left un-leased and it was the model we loved.
We took a tour of it and decided to sign the lease on the spot!
We move in March!
This apartment has every item on our list including grab bars in the bathrooms, showers and bathtub.
We came home, called our realtor, and put the house on the market in the middle of the worst snow storm for our area in 20 years.
We have had three different people look,, and I know someone will buy our home, because it is a great home in a wonderful neighborhood, and mostly because I believe GOD has directed our steps.
So, the decision has been made, and soon, the next chapter of our life will unfold.
GOD is good!!
I am happy.

In the Navy, I knew a fellow Gunner's Mate who had a quip for everything.
He could make me laugh at the drop of a hat, and when things were going wrong, quickly, he used to say; "I don't know what's happening, but its' happening fast!"
Well, in the last few weeks, that seems to be where I am with my PD and Dementia.
I have already told you about my recent issue, living out my dreams.
The pills the Neurologist gave me seem to be helping and my wife is getting used to sleeping with her catcher's mask on.
Now, I am having problems figuring our where I am, especially at night.
We went to bed last night, all tucked in, my wife had her catcher's mask on,  and I was just drifting off to sleep when I was overwhelmed with the feeling that I did not know where I was.
My wife was almost asleep and I woke her to ask, where are we?
Are we home?
I truly did not know.
It is a frightening feeling.
She assured me that we were safe, at home, in our bed, and I went back to sleep.
But this is a new development and one that I intend to monitor.
I suppose my wife is also!Additionally, I spend more and more time, thinking about the past, old shipmates, old stories.
The Internet is not my friend here, because I can search and find old friends, or more depressing, their obituaries.
Its' not that we don't get out, my wife makes sure that we go somewhere and interact with people everyday.
We go to the recreational center three days a week and get a vigorous physical workout.
It's those down times, that my mind slips back to the past and I am in my own world.
It's not frightening, just detached.
Actually, I am more comfortable there sometimes, not always.
Oh, well, I am sure other have had these issues before.
And I am not complaining, just keeping you informed.
Again, being able to discuss changes helps me deal with them.
Any feedback from anyone, I would really appreciate it.
</doc>
<doc date=Monday, January 18, 2010>
Recently, I have received some very nice, and very encouraging emails from some of you who take your busy time to read my blog.
I truly appreciate getting feedback from those of you who are having the same experiences that I am.
Some of you are farther down the path than I, and I appreciate the insight.
I pray that I give someone that insight also.Now that we are retired, life is slower, less complicated, and allows time for reflection on my situation and its' consequences.
I am enjoying the slower pace.
I enjoy my naps!
Naps are a good thing!
However, the time to reflect has brought issues that I had not expected.
For instance, today was the first time my wife has said, she was worried about my Parkinson's and dementia.
Up to now, she has been stoic, tough, almost in denial.
This openness may have come from me punching her the other night.
(Read my last post.
I am not a wife beater.)
Or, it could come from a more recent event.
A couple of days ago, I don't remember how far back, but recently, were at the Credit Union and I was paying a bill.
I had to sign the electronic pad to authorize the transaction, and I forgot how to write my signature.
I may have forgotten exactly who I was, I really don't know.
All I know is, I was blank!
My loving wife coached me into signing something that looked like my name, and we went on our way.
But it was disturbing.As I said, I have had time to reflect on what I have, and where things are going.
For the first time, I can really say I am frightened.
The unknown is always unnerving, but this is different.
The first time I went out of a helicopter on a half inch wire, 250 feet above a pitching Navy ship, I was frightened.
But, I knew others had done it and survived.
I also knew someone who did not survive.
But I realized that once I did it, the fear would be gone.
However, with PD and Dementia, I will never reach the point of familiarity.
I will only reach the point of no return.
And that is what has me frightened.
I told myself yesterday; "This is NOT how I want to die!"
In my Navy career, I did crazy, dangerous, even foolish things, in combat and on liberty.
If I would have been killed in any one of those situations, I would have had no regrets.
I have always been a man of action.
As a Gunner's Mate, I always took charge, especially in emergencies.
It is how GOD made me.
But now, all I can do is wait.
I can't charge out and confront the situation.
I can't solve the impossible equipment failure, I can't keep the unhappy sailor from committing suicide.
All I can do is wait for this disease to progress.
Yes, I can be proactive and exercise, take my meds, keep my medical appointments, be open with my wife and doctors about my symptoms, and I am doing all of that.
But to no avail.
I still get worse, I still am depressed, and I am still a worry to those who love me.
Again, I realize GOD has a plan for me, and I have no intentions of taking matters into my own hands.
I am sure that others who have been in my place have had much the same emotions.
I am only expressing them for my own well being.
You see, one thing I have learned, getting things in the open is better than keeping them bottled up inside.
Sometime you, I, can't tell everyone exactly what is on our mind or in our heart, but this blog let's me express my emotions when they are fresh and poignant.
Thanks for your concerns and encouragement.

I know I have been remiss in writing lately.
Over Christmas, my son and his family came to visit and spent 8 wonderful days with us.
Yes, there is stress with company.
But my wife and i love to have them here.
I had some issues with emotions and routine, butt they were manageable.
Now, my wife and I are settling into retirement.
This could be good!Now on to the new issue.
I have told you that my dreams are very vivid and very real to me.
In recent times, I have had difficulty separating my dreams from reality, after I wake up.
This can be frustrating when I spend a major portion of a day trying to remember what I was supposed to do.
Generally, I have this feeling of of the task having great importance.
Normally, at some time during the morning, I remember that it was in my dream and not a real issue that requires my attention.
Also, I have had issues when I dream of someone who I want to contact.
I wake up in the morning, determined that I will contact that person, only to realize later that they are deceased.
Naturally.
this is very disconcerting to me.
But now, I have a new issue to deal with.
Or should I say, my wife and I have a new issue to deal with.
Last night, I was having a very vivid dream where I was in a fight, and being restrained.
I broke free and I HIT the bad person in my dream!
Good you say, not really, because I PUNCHED my wife in the head!!
Now, I am not as strong as I used to be, but I hit her hard, just the same.
As she cried out, I awoke and realized what I had done.
Naturally, I was crushed that I hurt my wife.
But I was more concerned since this had happened once before.
That time, I was dreaming that I was in a fight and I reached out and grabbed the hair of the bad guy.
You got it, I grabbed my wife's beautiful long hair and gave it a strong pull!
This is not good.Today, as it happens, I had an appointment with my neurologist.
My wife and I described these events to her.
The doctor explained that when people are dreaming, they are in REM sleep and they are actually paralyzed, so they cannot act out their dreams.
This makes sense if you remember a particularly scary dream that you had and you could not move.
In any case, because of my dementia, the part of my brain that paralyzes me during REM sleep is breaking down, and I CAN act out my dreams!
This is a real issue, because it is not going to go away, it is going to get worse.
The doctor prescribed a drug to take at bedtime that may help with this.
She also recommended we sleep in different rooms!
Both my wife and I are not in favor of that, at least at this time.
But, she cannot continue to be battered in her sleep.
That is not fair.
So, we will see how this new medicine works.
I always knew the dementia and Parkinson's wold progress, but I never knew I would become a threat to my wife's well being.

<doc date=Saturday, November 7, 2009>
I have been struggling with an emotion that I have had problems dealing with.
That is this overwhelming feeling of being alone in my struggle.
Yes, I have a wonderful wife, a son who loves me, grandsons, a best friend that defines what a best friend should be, a Pastor that cares for me, a church family that others could only dream of, and co-workers that are concerned and caring.
So, you say, why do I feel alone?
Because I do not know anyone who is or has gone through what I am going through!
I am, as I like to say, plowing new ground!
And frankly, I don't like it.
My doctor can't tell me exactly what I have or what to expect.
The health care nurse that I talk to on a regular basis say that is normal for people with my conditions.
That's OK for her to say, but I am a Navy Gunner's Mate.
I have spend the last 40 years dealing in absolutes!
Now, I have to work with vague ideas and an attitude of "Wait and See".
It's damned frustrating, I don't mind telling you.
Sometimes it makes me very angry.
Other times I am very depressed about this problem.
Both emotions are useless, because I can't commiserate with anyone about them.
How I wish, there was a support group or even one person, that I could talk to about what is going on with me and what the future holds.
Amazing as it may seem, I cannot find one site on the Internet that addresses Parkinson's with dementia.
There are a few Lewy Body Dementia sites, but they are vague or out of date.
Am I the only person in the world going through these diseases?
I guess I really hope so, but I know better.
So, my frustration and rage continue.
Maybe someday, I will get to talk to someone and compare notes.
Until then, I am alone...

My wife and I have been busy the last 10 days starting the next phase of our lives together.
Others who know me or see me on a daily basis don't really notice the slow downward slide that I am in, but my wife of 36+ years does.
She knows that I get much more tired, with little or no real exertion.
She down plays it, but she sees it just the same.
She notices my mental confusion, my inability to make decisions, and just how slow I move.
Most of all, she understands, but also quietly observes my anger, rage, and frustration at life as it is.
The folks that work with me, see me at my best, after a long night's sleep, a full stomach, and with a full dose of meds in me.
They think all is well, and I am glad for that.
But in the evening, when I have problems talking, or when I choke on a raw carrot because I aspirate,  she knows.So, we have begun our transformation into a simpler life style.
We have both submitted our retirement papers.
Hers for this December, and mine for a Civil Service Disability retirement, which has to be approved by OPM.
Last week, We sold her beloved VW Beetle, "Sonshine".
We also traded our Toyota Van, which I truly liked, for a new Subaru Forester.
Why, because it is easier for my wife to drive, and more and more, the driving duties will fall to her.
And finally, we are placing our home on the market to facilitate moving into an "over 55" apartment.
Why, because the burden of keeping a house up, mowing the lawn, fixing the most simple mechanical or electric item in the house has become overwhelming to me.
Physically, it totally exhausts me to mow the lawn.
Normally, i do the front yard one day and the back the next.
Now we don't have a big yard.
But I completely soak everything I am wearing in sweat doing the yard, and it takes two hours for me to recover.
I am not complaining, it is just a fact of life.
Another reason we are making the move to simplify our lives it a quality of life issue.
We want to still have fun!
We want to spend our energies traveling, visiting family and friends, and doing things that interest us, when we want to do them.
"Things" can weigh you down.
Right now, we want freedom.
Again, don't worry, I actually feel better having these issues removed from our plate.
For instance; I waxed the new car last weekend.
OK, I used a new polymer product that is easy on, easy off.
And I used my electric buffer to buff the "Wax".
But the point is, when I had two cars to care for, I was overwhelmed by the task of cleaning two car, so I did not do any.
Sound stupid?
Maybe to you, ,but to me it was the way it was.
So no, I feel that I can accomplish my goal, and I feel motivated to accomplish it.
It did take me two days to do the car, but it does look good.The real point is, my wife and I have to learn how to best live, within the limitations of Parkinson's and Dementia, as these diseases progress.
Yes, I suppose I could expend energy fighting to do the things I did before.
But all I will do is end up tired and frustrated.
I choose to expend my energy on the things I enjoy and not he things that cause me issues.
Again, I don't think I am being selfish, just realistic.
And my wife agrees.

<doc date=Thursday, September 3, 2009>
Today, I had my usual 4 month meeting with my Neurologist.
She is an exceptional doctor and has taken great care of me.
She always spends a great deal of time explaining things to me and answering my questions.
She has been courteous and caring, at least until today.
Now I will admit that anyone can have an off day, be a little down, bothered by what someone else said, or just grumpy.
But, today my Neurologist just wasn't herself.
Since I have become ultra-sensative in recent months, I assume it is something I did.
Yes, I know what the word ASSUME is an acronym for.
But, just the same, did I do something wrong?I will admit, I spend a lot of time reading WEB info on my medical problems.
I believe I should be proactive about my medical condition, not passive.
So, I read WEBMD, and a web site called Patients Like Me, and anything I can get my hands on including books and articles.
I read about the drugs, new and old, tests in development, everything.
And, when I go to see my Neurologist, I ask HER the questions about what I have learned.
Why do I ask, because SHE is my Doctor.
The one with the Real Degree who is taking care of me.
Now, I do everything she tells me to do, and nothing the web articles tell me to do, unless she recommends it.Another asset I have, at least until today I thought it was an asset, is a telephone nurse who is from my insurance company.
She calls me, or I call her, on a regular basis, to discuss my progress, my meds, and what I am going to discuss with the doctor.
This telephone nurse does not talk to my doctor, only to me.
In any case, this telephone nurse recommended I ask the doctor if I might have Lewy Body Dementia as a particular type of dementia.
So, being the fool that I am, I wrote that question on my usual list of complaints, observations, and symptoms.
When my Neurologist read that on my list her attitude immediately changed.
She became curt, short, and almost angry with me.
I can only deduce that she does not like second opinions or someone second guessing her.I have learned something today, I will never ask another question, recommended by another medical person again.
Maybe I will just take my pills and be quiet.

Well, all the events of the summer of 2009 are complete!
Now maybe, I can get my routine back and start to feel better.
Ever since I developed Dementia, routine is very important to me.
I have noticed increased speech problems and further degradation in my memory.
For instance, I have had great difficulty remembering what day it was, our home address, and close friends names.
On the bright side, during a trip down memory lane in Cleveland, I was able to remember names of people from early in my childhood!
My wife and I just returned from our annual visit to Cleveland to visit my sister and brother.
It was a good trip and a good visit.
Except, my rambunctious miniature poodle barked too much and got my sister's neighbor angry.
Oh well, they are difficult people anyway.
After the trip to Cleveland, we went to Winona Lake, Indiana to look at a retirement community established by the Grace Brethren Church.
Since I love the Grace Brethren Church, I thought this would be a good place to retire.
I was not disappointed.
The facility they have built is spectacular.
The town homes are luxurious to say the least.
Pricing is fair, and the nursing home and assisted living facilities are good as well.
We even ate there and the food was very good.
The single problem is the location.
Medical facilities are 40+ miles away.
In a snowy climate, that is a show stopper.
Just the same, it is high on the list of considerations for the future.Prior to that, our son and his family visited for almost three weeks!
My daughter in law needed some surgery and trusted a surgeon she worked with here, in the past.
The surgery went much better than expected and I am grateful for that.
Since I am  so dependent on routine, this visit was difficult for me.
Don't get me wrong.
I really enjoyed their company.
But joy had a price to pay.
Just the same, they were understanding and helpful and I appreciate that.Earlier in the summer, we took the "Dead Relatives" tour.
But I already wrote about that.One nice thing about my trip to Cleveland, I was able to tour my old neighborhood, visit places I used to hang out at, and even talk to some old friends.
The walk down memory lane was enjoyable, and I wish I had more time to explore my old memories.
Maybe another day.

Sorry I have not had a post in a while.
Summer is always a busy time.
We just has a fantastic visit with my Sister's youngest son and his wife and children.
It was wonderful!
We went to the water park and had fun.
I really enjoy young children at a water park.
I had fun playing with them and watching them play.
We went to a motor park where they could actually drive go-carts that were age specific.
Again, true joy, for me and the children.
Not to mention my Nephew and his wife driving age specific cars for them too!
Then, I got to fulfill a little 9 year old boy's request.
He wanted to see an aircraft carrier.
So, using my Navy connections, I took all of us on a tour of the USS Truman.
It was the best part of the visit.
Not because I was back on a Navy ship, but because that little boy's eyes were so big.
All he could say was, "I did not know they were this big!"
I am really proud of my Nephew and his wife.
They are raising wonderful children and they are very much in love.
Their visit gave me energy, fun, and life.There are more summer things to do yet.
For instance, My wife and I are going to Omaha to do some grave site research.
My wife is into genealogy.
This is a trip she has wanted to do for a while, and she wants to take this trip while I still can.
I agree.
After that, we will make our annual trek to see my Son, Daughter-in-law and grandsons in upstate New York, go to Cleveland and see my Sister, and then go tour Grace Village in Winona Lake, Indiana, to see if that is where we want to retire.
A full summer for someone who does not have Parkinson's and Dementia.
For me it will be a challenge!So, now you are up to date, and I can address my topic.
I have a new business acquaintance, that is becoming a friend.
He is a well off entrepreneur, who has many friends like him.
One friend is in hospital management and research.
This medical friend is working with a hospital in the Ukraine that is doing extensive Stem Cell research.
My new friend knows of my medical issues, and offered to connect me to his medical friend to get me the treatment, in the Ukraine, for my Parkinson's and Dementia.
At first blush, most people would probably be interested.
A chance to get well, back to normal, a chance to extend my life and ensure a good quality of life.
But my view is different.
You see, I believe that abortion is KILLING a human being!
In my view, it is murder!
And I believe it is against God's plan.
So, how can I allow myself to benefit from something I am against.
Obviously, I cannot, and will not.
But I also have another view.
Ever since sin entered the world through Adam's sin, death has reigned.
We all die, and will continue to die, under God's control, until Jesus returns.
So, I am not in control of my life, its' length, or circumstances.
Yes, I have two neurological diseases that are degenerative and will continue to get worse until I die.
That apparently is God's plan for me, and I fully accept that.
As a matter of fact, I welcome it!
I don't want to live forever.
Remember what the Apostle Paul said, "To live is Christ and to die is gain."
Heaven is better than this life, for a Christian.
Finally, I have seen the direction of our country and this world, and I am not all that interested in living in it any longer than I have too.
No, I am not suicidal.
But I have had a great life, been blessed with great friends and family.
Done things others never dreamed of.
My life has been exciting and adventurous.
But I do not LOVE life.
Life is something I have to go through to get to heaven.
God gave me this life, and I cannot take it, only HE can.
And while I live, I will live for HIM.
But I will do nothing to artificially extend my life, even if I could.
And I will not go against my Christian values to benefit myself.
That's just me.

The folks at the pharmacy that I use are very nice and very caring.
There is one Pharmacist's Assistant that always looks after me and asks me or my wife how I am doing.
The other day, I went in to pickup some meds and she told me that I was their miracle patient.
I asked why.
She told me that most people on the meds that I am on just roll up in a ball and give up.
But that I was still going strong.
I told her that I did not have any quit in me.
I know I worried some of you with my "Depression" post, but I must be honest and depression is a real issue for me.
I really want you to know what is going on, and I am interested in feed back from others suffering with Parkinson's and Dementia and their care takers.
From what I read on other sites, I am not alone.
It is GOD, my wife, Family, Friends, Church Family,  work mates, and my little poodle "Marcel" that keeps me going.
The folks at the pharmacy are special to me, and those kind words helped.
If you folks don't give up on me, I won't give up either.

I have read many articles on the WEB about Parkinson's and Dementia.
Most if not all address depression.
But nothing written comes close to how depression effects me.
Most of my life I have been happy on the outside.
Smiling, joking, involved with organizations, my job, friends, church.
I had energy to do yard work wash and wax two cars, and still keep up with my wife, son, and friends.
Then I was diagnosed with Parkinson's and Dementia.
My view of illness has always been, how do we fix it.
When I had a colonoscopy at age 50, and the doctor found a tumor the size of a chickens egg, my reply was, "How do we fix it?"
I remember Dr. Keith Berger's look as I was waking up from by drug induced nap.
He said," I found a tumor and it is ugly!"
Well, what I have now can't be fixed and it is as ugly as that tumor to me..
Yes, we can slow it down, or so the doctors say.
I think I disagree with that, based on what is happening with me.
Or, if this is slow, I would HATE to see it progress FAST!
Now again, I have not given up, although the thought has crossed my mind a time or two.
But I am not a quitter, and I don't intend to start now with that bad habit.
But just the same, I am depressed.
Most folks can't see it from the outside, because my "Happy" face is on in public.
A friend at church last Sunday asked me how I was doing, my reply was my normal, "Outstanding!"
She replied, Sometimes I think you are just saying that and you really feel bad inside."
She was right!Depression has taken away from me the desire to do things that I used to like, even if I had the energy.
Recently, I let the grass grow for two weeks!
It looked terrible, but I just did not care.
I have plenty of things to do, things that I enjoyed before, but I just don't want to do them.
Work is becoming increasingly taxing on my mental energy and difficult.
It takes a major expenditure of energy to look happy and well.
And the organization I work for is going through a major reorganization.
Change is definitely not my friend!
One of the ways my Dementia has manifested itself is my inability to learn new material.
So, new organization, new computer programs, new accounting programs, new time keeping programs, new, new, new!!!
Did I tell you I have great difficulty learning new things.
Is anyone listening!!!
?Then there is the inability to cry!
That's right, I cannot cry.
I wish I could, but for some reason, I cannot let my emotions out.
That is a new problem since I was diagnosed.
So, my emotions remain bottled up.
When I was the Command Master Chief on the USS Caron, everyone used me to vent their problems on, even the Captain.
One day he asked me, "Who does the Command Master Chief confide in?"
the answer was no one.
I was alone.
And that is how I feel now.
Not all the time, but all the time.
I know that does not make sense.
MY wife has been exceptional!!
She is totally supportive.
Tries to understand.
Is not judgemental.
And in all ways has been a model wife, best friend, and care taker.
But I can see the stress on her when all I can talk about is what is going on with my medical problems.
I talk about my Parkinson's and Dementia constantly.
It is forefront on my mind!
It's much like a child who wants something real bad at Christmas.
All they can do is talk about that toy, show you pictures in the catalog, call the commercials on the television to your attention, and show you the toy in the store every time you go to the mall from Thanksgiving to Christmas morning!!
It becomes pretty monotonous.
That is what my wife is suffering through.
Again, she is fantastic.
But I sympathise with her.MY best friend, Jerry, is magnificent.
He keeps me going.
He shares many of the interests I had before I got sick.
Jerry has always been there for me.
Through thick and thin.
He has been more loyal than a brother.
Jerry gets me out of the house, doing things, and he understands my trials.
I could not make it without him and his wife.Then there is my Church family.
My Pastor and his wife are a great source of spiritual help and love.
The entire fellowship is supportive, kind, and loving.
So there is no shortage of folks that are ready to help.
Yet, the depression will not let me be.I feel as though I am trapped in a room with no doors or windows.
The room is slowly closing in on me from all sides and there is nothing I can do.
I feel defeated, helpless, and useless.
When I am in public, whether it is work or social, I feel I have to put on a facade of feeling good, being tough, and ready to go the next round.
The truth is, I would really like to sit out a few rounds before I get off the stool again.
But, I just can't rest right now.
Robert Frost wrote a poem that describes my condition;Stopping By Woods on a Snowy EveningWhose woods these are I think I know.His house is in the village though;He will not see me stopping hereTo watch his woods fill up with snow.My little horse must think it queerTo stop without a farmhouse nearBetween the woods and frozen lakeThe darkest evening of the year.He gives his harness bells a shakeTo ask if there is some mistake.The only other sound's the sweepOf easy wind and downy flake.The woods are lovely, dark and deep.But I have promises to keep,And miles to go before I sleep,And miles to go before I sleep.(c) Copyright 2002 CyberSpace SpinnerI still have miles to go before I sleep.
But less than when I started this journey.Depression is relentless, all consuming, dark, isolating.
I despise it, but just like Parkinson's and Dementia, there is no cure, just treatment.
So, I will just have to fight on.
Like I said, there is no quit in me.

One of the big topics between my wife and I is; Where do we retire?
This has been the topic of many deep discussions.
We have a beautiful one story home, on a small lot, in Virginia Beach, Virginia.
Some would say it is ideal.
But I see problems.
First of all, maintaining the house is becoming overwhelming.
It takes all of my energy to mow the front and back yard.
Yes that includes trimming, edging,  and cleanup.
But after that, I am wiped out!
I can imagine in the near future it will be a two day job.
Then there is the expense of keeping the house up.
In the last three years I have put a new roof on, replaced the heating and cooling system, refaced some bathroom cabinets, a new garage door, and some other needed replacements.
I can hear you now, "It's all done, what more do you need?"
Well, the kitchen needs remodeled, new carpet, paint inside, and the vinyl siding is 20 year old builder's grade.
All in all, there is still much to do.
and to be honest, I don't want to spend the money.
Then there is the everyday maintenance like clogged drains, dripping faucets, and caulking!
Then there is the inconvenience of the occasional hurricane!
They are an ever present danger for those who live on the east coast.
Yes, I love the ocean,  but it has it's cost.So, what do we do?
I have decided, yes I can still make decisions, that we should live in a rental unit of some type.
This will completely relieve me of any maintenance issues.
We have agreed to live in an over 55 complex.
I think that will be good.
It makes sense to live around people of like interests and abilities.
The area has not been as easy a decision.
As I said, we really like the Hampton Roads area,.
We have been here for 25+ years.
Our friends are here.
Doctors that we trust are here.
Our Church family is here.
All of my Navy benefits are here.
I enjoy being around the Navy.
I like to look at ships.
But, other areas are less expensive than the Hampton Roads area.
Another idea is to move to a retirement village owned and operated by the Grace Brethren Church in Winona Lake, Indiana.
It has many appealing features.
But no Navy benefits, and it SNOWS!
Yes, they do all the maintenance, including SNOW removal.
But the fact that there is SNOW is a major detractor.My wife and I have looked a a number of over 55 communities in the area and plan to look at a few more in the near future.
I know we need to make a decision, and we need to sell the house, even in this down market.
Time is wasting and I would like to make this move while I am still able, mentally and physically.
So, the search goes on and so does the frustration and uncertainty.
I pray that we will find our future home soon.

Last Monday, for the very first time, I was completely unable to do my job.
I was at work and needed to get one of my team members on the road.
I have processed travel orders thousands of times over the last 15 years.
I have become fairly good at manipulating our computer system that stores accounting data, travel reservations, and time computations.
But Monday, I completely lost the ability to get accounting data  from the computer, to complete a travel request.
At first I thought I knew what I was doing.
I looked in books, logs, even old files.
But try as I might, I could not even figure out what I was looking for.
For two hours I looked frantically, not even knowing what I was looking for!
Then, the team mate who needed the accounting data to complete his urgent travel request came into my office and asked, "Boss, do you have those numbers yet?"
That frustrated me all the more.
And I went into the common area to look at some more books as I replied, "It's not as easy as you think!"
Now, the others knew I was having a problem.
Why, because  I have produced that information in 2 minutes many times before.
Then, my best friend and truly the brains of my operation, quietly told me,  "Its in the computer program."
Then, and only then, did I remember where the info was and how to start to find it.
Two hours of lost time, frustration, and despair.Now, I have told you before that I have gotten lost driving, briefly lost the ability to read a few times, and have had other brief moments of confusion.
And yes, I loose the ability to speak coherently when I am tired.
But this was in the middle of the morning and after a good nights sleep.
I was scared and embarrassed.
Yes, with my friends coaching, it passed, But I know it will return more often for longer and longer times.
But the most difficult thing is this time, for the first time, it negatively impacted my ability to do my job.
I have a lot to think and reflect on.

For many of you, and me, until recent medical issues, Having a cold was an annoyance.
It was fairly easy to manage.
Take some Actefed and Robitussin, maybe an aspirin for fever and body aches, but that was about it.
But Parkinson's and Dementia have changed all of that.
First of all, I take so many drugs that my pill box has wheels.
If I get one any larger, I will have to register it with the Department of Motor Vehicles and pay personal property tax on it.
Taking so many different medicines makes taking anything for colds a real challenge.
Trying to figure out which drug interacts with what drug, is a real challenge.
Last winter, I asked my Neurologist what, if anything, I could take for a cold or the flu.
Her answer was very limiting.
I can take the new formula Actefed, and Robitussin cough medicine, but that's it!
Anything else, go to the Doctor.
The new formula Actefed does not work for me, so I am doomed to breath out of my mouth at night.
And with no way of controlling the post nasal drip, I choke all night.
I have found that hot tea helps with the congestion and so does orange juice.
I hate to be a wimp, but my GP is going to see a lot more of me.

Yesterday, while at physical therapy, I had a very good discussion with the individual administering my therapy.
It seems he has spent some time and effort in studying the effects of Parkinson's and how physical therapy can help.
He explained to me that he just attended a seminar on the effects of PD, on walking.
The main speaker, an individual with a PhD, who's name was not revealed, stated that PD patients should be in physical therapy early to help reduce the effects of the rigidity.
That PD patients should do exercises daily to help maintain flexibility and posture.
And that PD patients should be taught the proper use of canes and walkers BEFORE they need them.
The premise being, when a PD patient is in need of the device, they are too crippled to teach the proper use.
Of course, to keep the skill, the patient must practice with the cane and walker, every week!
Let me take you back a few years.
Remember when you were in school and the  doctor decided you needed glasses?
Did you wear them when you were out of your parents sight?
No!!
Why, because they were not cool.
Appearance is important to us and our ego.
And trust me, at 58, with PD and Dementia, my ego is all I have left.
Now I have given in and started to use my cane, and I admit, I appreciate it from time to time.
And, my "Sympathy Stick" as one friend calls it, has gotten me head of the line privileges on more than one occasion.
But a walker!!
No way.
Not yet.
Not at home, not in public, no!That being said, I did see a really slick walker when I went to get my cane.
It had had brakes, a soft seat, and under the seat was a cooler that would hold a six pack of beer with ice!!
Very cool.

My Neurologist has recently prescribed Physical Therapy for the stiffness and rigidity that I experience in my legs, shoulders and arms.
The first appointment, the Therapist did a series of objective tests.
I was impressed, because they actually had measurements of my flexibility, my balance, and my ability to reach.
Many of the tests had actual measurements that were taken.
Others had timing involved.
All of these measurements were placed in a computer program and a score was produced.
That score said I should use a cane, or some sort of walking assist.
I don't feel I need a cane.
My doctor's reply is, do you want to wait until you fall and break a hip before you use a cane?
OK, she wins.The following therapy has been stretching, balance exercise, and strengthening exercises.
Try standing on a 6 inch thick block of medium soft foam, with your feet together, your arms crossed over your chest, and your eyes closed.
For me, that is next to impossible.
I fall over, almost every time!Another balance concern is in the shower.
I have a habit of washing my hair with my back to the shower head, then turning around to rinse the shampoo off.
I make this turn with my eyes closed.
I have a dislike for shampoo in my eyes.
That move,, with my eyes closed, make me very unstable, and I have almost fallen a few times.
To help with that, my wife and I are changing our morning routine so that I take my shower before she goes to work.
Just in case I fall.
A small concession to a big issue.I will let you know if the physical therapy helps after the 4 weeks of treatments.
I have reserved judgement, since right now, my legs hurt more than before I started.

Sounds like something high society folks do.
Last summer we went to the Hampton's and aspirated!
But it's not, it is something those of us with Parkinson's do, and it's not good.
To "Aspirate" is to inhale food.
Again, not good.
I first started to have problems with aspirating a few months back.
The first time it happened, I really got a large amount of food down my wind pipe and I could not clear it out.
The food reached my lungs and I nearly passed out before I cleared my airway.
I was coughing and gasping for breath as the room got dark and I got dizzy.
The articles I have read on WEB MD say that this is from the swallowing muscled becoming weak.
All I know is it makes eating difficult and somewhat frightening.
I used to just gobble down a meal.
I was always the first one done, and if I have not had an incident in a few days, I revert to that way of eating.
But, soon I will inhale when food is just beginning to go down my throat and PRESTO, I am turning blue.Now you can say, that's easy to solve, eat slower, properly chew your food, take smaller bites.
True, all good advice.
But I have been gobbling down food ever since I was stationed on my first ship, the USS Mullinnix.
On my other blog, The Master Chief's Lair, I have explained that we had a mess decks capable of seating 65 or so.
With a crew of over 400, and an hour to feed the crew, you can see where eating fast was a benefit.
So, I inevitably return to my training and eat fast, chew less, and choke!I wonder if other are having this problem and if you have any suggestions on have to manage this issue.
Please let me know.

Life, and how it progresses is an interesting thing.
I have seen many changes and many amazing events in my lifetime.
Space travel, the microwave oven, personal computers, and cell phones, all technical marvels.
Especially since I remember having a party line telephone and I remember when passenger airplanes were propeller driven.
But the thing I have seen that disturbs me, very much, is the decline of America!!
Our society has completely descended into self-gratification and moral decay.
The America I grew up in was not perfect.
There were unwanted children, poverty, crime, illicit sex, and drugs.
But not to the level of today, and not marketed by Hollywood.
Mom's stayed home and raised children, made dinner, cleaned the home, had gardens.
Husbands worked, came home to a relatively well adjusted family, played with the children, and later, played with the wife.
Today, everything is throw away.
If anything goes wrong, its' gone.
Including marriages and kids.
People are only interested in their own gratification.
The motto of the 60's, "If it feels good, do it."
is the mantra of today's society.
More is good in every arena, money, houses, cars, sex, drugs, booze, college degrees, and possessions.
But all of this means nothing and can be thrown away if it fails to meet the irrational expectations of the individual.Why has America fallen on its' own sword of success?
Because it was easy.
Our parents, if you are a "Boomer" made life easy for us.
The government made life easy for us.
Most of us have never really had to work for, wait for, save for, anything.
Credit, parents, government programs, have made everything easy and therefore diminished the value of everything.
We have even diminished the value, and intimacy of sex through pornography, and loose morals.OK, to you who are younger, I sound like an old prude.
But, experience has taught me that all that glitters is not gold.
Sometimes the most precious thing we obtain are the thing we had to work the hardest for.
But, if you never had to work hard for anything, you will not understand that.
But, America, stand by, because we are going to have to work hard, just to survive.
And even at that, we may not.So, how does this fit in my PD blog?
Well, having Parkinson's and Dementia makes me work hard to appear and act normal,  to do the things I used to do without effort.
But, I keep trying to be what I was before this challenge.
Some folks look at me and say, "Your not sick"  or "You look fine."
That aggravates me and makes me happy at the same time.
Aggravation because people think I am lying about my issues.
Well, they don't know how hard I am working to look "Normal" to them..
Happy, because I know I can still "Do it".What about our country?
I don't know.
I think as a nation we are about to get the biggest dose of reality we have ever seen.
How this "Me first" generation responds will be interesting and will tell the future.
When there is no easy food, no easy jobs, no safety net, that's when we will see what we are made of.
Protecting yourself and your family will be your job.
Providing food, shelter, warmth, will be your job.
The future will be interesting, but I am not sure I want to watch.
We will see what we will see.

I am a retired Navy Master Chief Gunner's Mate, who worked in the MK 42 and MK 45 5"/54 gun mount world.
To say that we "Bathed" in the hydraulic fluid would be an understatement.
We did not use protective clothing, respirators, masks, or eye protection of any kind.
We often had open cuts and scrapes that permitted anything to enter our bodies.
On my first three ships, showers were a luxury.
So was drinking water on my first ship, for that matter.
I remember going for 30 days without a shower!
So, we were constantly in contact with, drenched in, covered by, and breathed in, hydraulic fluid, Mil-F-17111.
But, whats to worry?
It's just good old petroleum based oil.
Nothing synthetic like some of the Snipes (Propulsion Rates) had to deal with.
Then, in 1989, the year I retired, the Navy told us that there was a chemical added to the hydraulic fluid, that was carcinogenic and neurotoxic!!!
That chemical was tricrysl Phosphate.
They changed the formula of Mil-F-17111, but did not flush the old oil out of the hundreds of gun mounts, missile launchers, and gun turrets in the Navy.
By this time, I was a tech rep at Naval Sea Support Center,, Atlantic.
Doing what?
Bathing in hydraulic oil.The date of this writing is May 28, 2009.
A little over 18 months ago, I was diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease (PD) and Dementia.
The neurologist, who took 9 months to make that determination, believes a contributing factor was my extensive exposure to the hydraulic fluid in the gun mounts.
She has been very aggressive with my treatment, just as she was with the testing that lead her to this diagnosis.
I take medication for the PD and it helps with the rigidity.
I take Razadyne and Namenda for the Dementia, but they do little for the Dementia's progression.
I have good days, and bad days.
However, I notice the downward spiral of these degenerative conditions.
Not to worry.My goal of this BLOG, is to share my experiences, good and bad, and to learn from others experiencing the same challenges.
Those of us with PD and Dementia have few to talk to, discuss experiences with, and to compare note with.
Sometimes, I feel alone, and I am looking for a friend to walk with me these last few miles.So, hop on board if you have PD and/or Dementia or are a care giver for someone who does.
We can learn from each other and get stronger together.
